Introduction Members of the Mississippi Legislature and distinguished citizens, I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to present my seventh State of the State Address.
The highest honor of my life continues to be serving as your Governor.
"December 10, 1950, upon receiving the Nobel Prize, one of Mississippi's most eloquent sons, William Faulkner, stated: ""I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail."
Can there be any doubt that the beloved state of his birth served as the inspiration for these immortal words?
For while we have endured much -- there is no doubt in my heart that the new Millennium will find a new Mississippi -- and that we shall, indeed, prevail.
II.
The State of the State A.
With each advancing year, our Mississippi Miracle increases in scope and magnitude.
The solutions to all the challenges we face -- employment, education, medical care, and criminal justice -- originate with economic growth.
New and better jobs, profitable and growing businesses work in two ways: by reducing demands on our taxpayers to fund our welfare system and by creating better opportunities for all Mississippians.
Economic development has been and will continue to be the flagship of this administration.
According to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission, the number of Mississippians employed reached an all-time high in July of 1997.
The months of April and November posted the lowest jobless rates for those months in more than twenty years.
When final 1997 figures are released, it is expected that the jobless rate will fall below six percent for the first time since 1979.
Since January 1992, new and expanded business and industry have invested more than $13 billion in Mississippi, with a net gain of more than 160,000 new jobs.
C. While we have made tremendous strides toward greater economic security, safety in our homes and on our streets remains one of my prime concerns.
Together, we have taken steps to eradicate crime against our law-abiding citizens.
We have secured more than 6,600 new prison spaces -- a 71 percent increase and the largest increase in Mississippi history.
Drug arrests are up more than 85 percent and Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol DUI arrests are up more than 116 percent since 1992.
D. Through the waiver process (before Congress passed its historic act) this Administration began some of the first welfare reform measures in the United States.
In 1997, Policy Review magazine recognized Mississippi as fifth in the nation for reducing the number of families receiving AFDC cash assistance and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services placed us sixth in the nation in welfare caseload reduction.
Since February 1992, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of welfare and food stamp cases in Mississippi.
In this almost six year period, welfare rolls decreased by 54% and food stamp cases dropped by 30%.
More important than the decline in number of cases is our early success in helping people find employment - - the passport to pride, independence and self-sufficiency.
With the statewide rollout of our work program we are now able to provide job readiness and job placement services to all welfare recipients.
Since February 1995, 555 churches have joined forces with our Faith and Families initiative and more than 950 families participate in the program.
199 have found employment through this program.
Let me remind the critics of welfare reform that our citizens are more than ready for us to tackle the problem of welfare dependency - - and they are among the most compassionate people in this country.
"E. A recent article in the Boston Globe observed that Mississippi tax filers gave ""an average of $3,430 to charity in 1995 – fourth-highest in the nation, hundreds of dollars more per person than New Hampshire and Rhode Island combined."
The article equates high charitable giving with conservative political beliefs and distrust of impersonal government handouts.
"The writer closes the article with the statement: ""If I were hungry or homeless and needed a helping hand, I'd rather be in Mississippi than Massachusetts."
I concur wholeheartedly.
III.
1998 Legislative Agenda A.
Our 1998 Legislative Agenda addresses the demands of our citizens for criminal justice reform, education reform, constitutional reform, taxpayer protection, and the well-being of all Mississippians.
I commend the swift and sure action of the 1998 Legislature to enact a constitutional amendment to consecrate the rights of crime victims -- a key recommendation of the Governor's Commission on Criminal Justice Reform that I commissioned last year and a primary goal of my 1998 legislative agenda.
The task force we assembled is made up of men and women of diverse backgrounds.
They worked hard and without pay for a cause in which they believe.
Their citizenship is to be commended and their insight into this problem deserves your attention and mine.
At this time, let me introduce to you the co-chairs of the criminal justice task force: Kathy Sones, an Assistant District Attorney from Lamar County and President of the Mississippi Prosecutors' Association, and Wyatt Emmerich, President of Emmerich Newspapers and Publisher of The Northside Sun.
Members of the Legislature, let us build upon this spirit of teamwork.
I encourage you to enact the legislation necessary to satisfy the second recommendation of the Governor's Commission on Criminal Justice Reform: let us eliminate excessive delays in executions of violent murderers on death row.
As we secure a safer state for our young Mississippians, let us seek genuine education reform to promote our children's success in school and to ensure that a better life is within their grasp.
"Join with me to reward our excellent teachers by increasing the salaries of nationally certified teachers (or as we referred to them in our 1994 legislative agenda -- ""master teachers"") to the national average or by $6,000 – whichever is higher."
Let us build on the work of Representatives Charlie Smith and Rita Martinson and implement the Mississippi Excellent Reading Grant Program, a program to teach students to read, successfully, through proven phonics techniques.
C. Ladies and gentlemen of the Mississippi Legislature, join with me to comply with the demands of our citizens for efficiency in state government by having the Governor and Lieutenant Governor run on the same ticket, beginning with the election of 2003.
Let us increase Department of Transportation effectiveness by appointing the leadership at the Department of Transportation.
Mississippi is the only state in the nation that still elects transportation commissioners.
D. You may have read about or attended meetings of the Mississippi Trauma Care Task Force that we assembled in early May.
I want to thank the members of this commission and recognize the Chairman of this group, my friend, Dr. Briggs Hopson of Vicksburg, who serves as the Medical Director of the State's Emergency Medical Services.
This outstanding group devoted long hours and hard work to a cause that is as close and personal to me as the breath in my body.
I suspect that our Lieutenant Governor has strong feelings about the importance of proper trauma care, as well.
My message to you in this area is simple: let's stop studying this issue and, instead, act now.
To ensure that, in times of crisis, all Mississippians may access prompt, efficient, and timely trauma care, I support the implementation of a network of trauma care centers.
E. In keeping with the ideals of a free nation opposed to political coercion, let us ensure paycheck protection for Mississippi workers, thereby prohibiting the current practice of forced contributions to political agendas.
Current law already prohibits employers from abusing their employees in this way.
There is no reason unions should not play by the same rules.
IV.
Preventing a Legacy of Debt and Bureaucratic Growth A.
No one in this state cares more for the children of Mississippi than I.
No one here wants more desperately than I to establish a legacy of productive achievement for future generations of Mississippians.
I care too much about our children's future to leave them a legacy of debt, to use them as an excuse to raise taxes, or to spend hard- earned tax dollars with callous indifference.
Four months before I was elected Governor, the General Fund ending cash balance for Fiscal Year 1991, after $90 million in budget cuts, was down to $3.6 million.
Within three months of taking office, I was forced to make $75 million in additional budget cuts just to maintain a constitutionally required balanced budget.
Runaway spending and overly optimistic revenue projections during the preceding years brought Mississippi to its fiscal knees.
C. In the 1992 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 3120 (The Sales Tax Increase/Education Enhancement Fund) was passed by the 1992 Legislature.
I vetoed this bill, only to have my veto overridden.
Senate Bill 3120 contained requirements that state agencies delete 10 percent of positions at the rate of 2 percent per year for the period FY 93 through FY 97.
These reductions were statutorily mandated by the Legislature in this act.
However, authorized positions in state government have not gone down.
They have increased, significantly.
Some agency increases (like the Department of Corrections and Gaming) are understandable.
But to use the promise of a smaller government to justify that tax increase has become nothing more than a cruel hoax on our taxpayers.
No one denies the critical importance of adequately funding education and other needs in this state, but the bottom-line issue must remain: How large a piece of this pie do you want to go to fund bureaucracy and bonded indebtedness?
D. I would like to share a few quotations published in a local paper on the subject of education funding.
"On April 29, a State Senator was quoted as saying: ""This bill, for the first time, fully funds education permanently in this state""; Another proponent said: ""The old problems of not having adequate books and buses and buildings will be alleviated, allowing districts to turn their attention to performance."
"On May 4 it was reported: ""Supporters of the bill tout its earmarking of tax proceeds for specific and pressing needs in the state's 149 school districts."
Money would flow to repair and renovate buildings, purchase new buses, buy classroom supplies and lower the spending gap between affluent and poor school districts.
You may have thought that these quotes were from the recent debate over the Mississippi Adequate Education Program.
They are not.
Instead, they were written about Senate Bill 3120 (the Legislature's one-cent sales tax increase) and were published in 1992.
It is no accident that the promise of money for books, buses, and buildings has been made twice now in the last six years.
"Education and ""the children"" have repeatedly been used as the excuse de jure to raise taxes and increase the size of government."
E. With our ever-increasing bonded indebtedness, the incessant growth of government, and budget built-ins, we could easily face another budget crisis of epic proportions.
The total size of Mississippi government and its rate of growth is often under- reported.
General Fund growth is only part of the story.
The big picture is the General Fund plus all other revenue and total expenditures.
In 1987, the total size of Mississippi state government was $3.3 billion.
In 1997, it was reported at $7.6 billion.
In short, it more than doubled in ten years.
In 1989, net direct General Obligation Bond Debt was $230 million.
In 1997, it was reported at $1.3 billion: a 493 percent increase in only eight years.
F. Amid this maelstrom of impending debt and dire budgetary concerns, there are forces for moderation that consistently impart sanity and reason.
I have held numerous conversations with our Appropriations Committee Chairmen and know how hard they have tried to restrain this runaway train.
They need your support.
G. Join with me, ladies and gentlemen, to cap the growth of general obligation bonded indebtedness.
Let us cease the pernicious practice of mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future for political expediency.
Let us lead by example.
Work with me ladies and gentlemen, also to create a tobacco trust fund to provide tax refunds from the net money collected or -- if not a tax refund -- to create a trust fund in which the principal remains inviolate and the interest may be used for the needs of future generations of Mississippians.
Our Constitution gives the privilege and the responsibility of deciding the best way to spend all revenue to you, the elected representatives of the people of Mississippi.
I assure you that I will fight any attempt by the federal government or by any judge to usurp your spending authority and to dictate to you how this money should be spent.
Posterity will applaud the wisdom, integrity, and vision of the 1998 Legislative Session, if we work together to accomplish these two fiscal objectives.
V. Motor Voter There is another issue of great importance facing our state this year -- Motor Voter legislation.
It is no secret that I am no fan of Motor Voter.
There isn't enough time for me today to let you know how strongly I feel about what is often called the forgotten part of the Bill of Rights: the Tenth Amendment.
For that reason I consider Motor Voter an unwarranted federal intrusion into our state's election laws -- and one that can leave our elections process at the mercy of this and every Congress that follows.
There are plenty of documented examples of voter fraud that have occurred as a result of motor voter procedures in other states.
Mississippi already has one of the most open voter registration processes in the country.
It seems to me that the least we can do is ensure that we have a weapon against the increased opportunity for fraud that motor voter will undoubtedly furnish.
Voter identification is not voter intimidation.
Showing a form of identification at the polls will be no more intimidating than doing so on a Saturday night at the video store or in the checkout line at your grocery store.
VI.
Conclusion To the great detriment of our nation, political discourse is rarely about facts and reality, but is dominated too often by fuzzy, feel-good terms.
In liberal quarters, conservatives are often depicted as being devoid of compassion.
I deny this categorically: the conservative philosophy reflects a genuine compassion.
We as conservatives, because of our genuine compassion for the poor, are committed to helping people move from a life of government- dependency to one of self-reliance and self-respect that comes from receiving a paycheck.
I am a conservative.
I also care about Joe and Jane Everyman, who work forty-hour weeks to care for, nourish, and educate their children.
I care about the young man or woman, starting a small business .
. . hoping it will grow into a larger business.
If our society allows entrepreneurial and innovative genius to be so diminished by the heavy hand of the tax collector that our magnificent free enterprise system is crushed -- then we shall end on the trash heap of history, directly beside the former Soviet Union.
I hope that we, who are so honored by our fellow citizens in their granting us the privilege of public service, will act together to leave a legacy of hope and an atmosphere in which dreams may become reality.
May God bless each of you.
May God bless the State of Mississippi and the United States of America.
