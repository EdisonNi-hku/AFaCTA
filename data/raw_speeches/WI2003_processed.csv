SENTENCES
"the spouse of a middle school educator, I have come to believe that the middle school years are some of the most crucial in determining our children's future."
"I have heard experts say it, I have read statistics to support it, but also seeing my sons and their friends grow up, I know how true it is."
Jessica and I have decided that we together are going to lead the effort to establish the Community Connections initiative to encourage greater community commitment to our middle schools.
"We want people to get involved serving as mentors, participating in after school activities, rebuilding playing fields, providing apprenticeships, or working with a troubled child during one of the most difficult periods of life."
"From a senior citizen who brings the wise perspective of time to an auto mechanic who can provide a helping hand in shop class, we all have something to offer."
"But our goal should be not only to get our communities more involved with our middle school students, but also our students more involved in their own communities."
"The results: greater civic responsibility, enhanced skills for the new economy, improved academic performance."
"Beyond education, another important priority is health care."
We've always had great health care in Wisconsin.
"But right now, the system isn't working well for anyone involved."
Individuals are paying more and getting less.
Health care costs are crippling schools and small businesses.
"Prescription drug costs are climbing, especially for seniors."
"Not only do rising health care costs hurt individuals and businesses, they are a major cause of our state's fiscal problems."
We need to search for creative solutions to these problems.
"Throughout the state, small businesses have told me they want to do the right thing for their employees, but the rising cost of insurance premiums is making it harder every day, especially in troubled economic times."
Farmers tell me of the fear of being one accident or illness away from financial ruin.
The health care crisis won't be solved in Madison alone.
"And in these difficult budget times, we are even more limited in what we can do."
But we can take important steps forward.
I am directing state government to develop a Health Insurance Purchasing Pool to allow small businesses and farmers to take advantage of the buying power of state government to purchase more affordable health care coverage for their employees and their families.
This is a perfect example of how state government can extend a hand and make a real difference in people's lives without establishing an expensive government program.
"I have also directed our government to find new ways to pool our prescription drug purchases, with those of local governments and even other Midwestern states, so that we can increase our bargaining power and obtain lower costs for prescription drugs."
"And while we look for new ways to tackle the health care crisis, we must also protect those programs that help so many Wisconsin citizens receive the health care they need."
We have to stand by those who need our help the most because this isn't just about quality of life; it's a matter of life and death.
"Third, we must get our economy moving again."
People in Wisconsin earn about 13 percent less than the national average.
We've been falling behind the rest of the country for 30 years.
"Over the last 10 years, we've lost more than 50,000 college graduates to other states."
"For too long, state government has acted as though the best jobs program was hiring more people in the Department of Commerce."
I believe it's creating an environment hospitable to innovation.
I believe it's creating the best educated work force in America.
I believe it's helping small businesses with the crippling cost of health care.
"We can't run Wisconsin's economy from this room, and we shouldn't try."
Our job is to unleash the innovative spirit of our people.
"Today, I am announcing that I will bring government, labor and business together to craft and implement a single, focused strategic plan to grow Wisconsin's economy."
"Here in Madison, the University has always been an engine for economic growth."
"For example, the cutting edge research in biotechnology at the University will provide not only dramatic medical breakthroughs, but also millions of dollars in new investment, new jobs and new opportunities for our people."
But we also must take advantage of the resources and expertise of our other university and technical college campuses to foster economic growth throughout the state.
But there is probably nothing we can do to help economic growth more than to balance this budget without raising taxes.
Some have suggested that we should just do as many other states are doing and raise taxes.
"But you know what, if we were to try to solve this problem through tax hikes, we would have to increase income taxes 37% this year or increase the sales tax by 51%."
"Obviously, raising taxes is not the answer."
"Holding the line on taxes helps our businesses grow, makes us more competitive with other states, and creates job opportunities for our families."
"To be sure one of things that makes Wisconsin such a wonderful place to live is our natural resources our lakes, streams, and forests."
It is one of the reasons I love Wisconsin.
For 12 years as Attorney General I worked to protect our environment and that will be a major focus of our efforts for the next four years.
"One example from just yesterday: After years of deadlock and fighting, we are moving forward to cleaning up the dangerous toxic chemicals that have polluted the Fox River."
"Yesterday, the state, the EPA and one of the paper companies announced a down payment to start what may become the largest cleanup of a river in North America."
It's a step and we have many more to go but we're moving in the right direction towards a cleaner Wisconsin.
"It's a good start for this, ""the year of water."
"Finally, public integrity is Wisconsin's proudest tradition, and it's time to bring it back."
"That starts with this challenge: Let's enact a campaign-finance reform law, and let's do it this session."
"A number of legislators, including Republican Senator Ellis and Democrat Erpenbach have offered ideas of how to solve this important problem."
"I can't guarantee we'll agree on the details, but I do promise I'll do everything I can to find common ground."
And let's pass the Impartial Justice Bill so campaigns for our state's highest court are not controlled by big money and special interests.
And let's continue Wisconsin's historic commitment to open government by passing legislation to restore openness and let the sun shine in.
We can make real progress on all these priorities right now.
And we can make even more once the budget crisis is out of the way.
"Our problems are deep, and our challenge is difficult.But it can be done."
"It's a new day in Wisconsin -- a bright, beaming hour brimming with possibility.From Merrill to Madison .Oshkosh to Eau Claire .Peshtigo to Prairie du Chien ."
great things are happening in Wisconsin.And we shouldn't forget it.
"For example, if anyone doubts Wisconsin's determination in the face of adversity, just ask a five-foot-eight-inch kid from Tony, Wisconsin, population 180."
He walked onto the UW football squad rather than accept a scholarship out of state.His name is Jim Leonhard.
Today he's an All-American who holds the school record for interceptions and punt return yards.
"If anyone questions our commitment to kids, just ask Carol Hooker, a star fifth-grade teacher at Franklin Pierce Elementary in Milwaukee."
"Carol became a teacher through the Milwaukee Teacher Education Center, or MTEC -- a not-for-profit teacher certification program that provides qualified, diverse educators for the Milwaukee public schools."
MTEC helps career-track professionals become certified teachers through on-the-job training.
"Carol is one of thousands of teachers in Wisconsin who are serving our kids, even though other lines of work might offer more glamour or financial rewards."
"They're committed to our kids, and we should be just as committed to them."
"If anyone wonders about the value of public service, just ask Lieutenant Michael ""Woody"" Woodzicka from Appleton, Wisconsin."
"Last year, he and his partner were nominated to the Fire and Police Hall of Fame for forcing open the second-floor door of a burning building and carrying an unconscious 18-year-old woman to safety."
"If these heroes could brave thick smoke and blazing fire to save a woman's life, the least you and I can do is brave controversy and political costs to balance the state budget."
"If anybody thinks we cannot provide health care to our communities, just ask Gus Frank, Tribal Chairman of the Forest County Potowatomi Tribe."
Folks in Forest County used to have to travel all the way to Rhinelander for health care.Not anymore.
The Potowatomi Tribe built a $10 million health care center in Crandon that's open to every member of the community.
"In fact, 60 percent of its patients are non-Native American."
More than 70 percent of kids are now immunized.
Pregnant women are getting exceptional prenatal care.
"And the clinic is serving 4,000 patients."
"If anyone questions Wisconsin's readiness to sacrifice for a better tomorrow, just ask the 1,650 members of the Wisconsin National Guard who have been called up to active duty since 9/11."
"No matter where you stand on foreign policy, I know every person in this state joins me in saluting these brave men and women for their service."
These people -- and so many more across our state -- are proof of what Wisconsin can achieve.
And I'm not asking state government to do anything the people of Wisconsin don't do every day.
Would you join me in thanking them for what they do every day for Wisconsin.
I believe the people of Wisconsin have chosen representatives who can rise to the greatness the moment demands.
"Just like the people we serve, we know what sacrifice is."
We understand the right choice can be painful.
"But we also know, in equal measure, how meaningful hard work can be."
"Lately, people have asked why I'd want this job in these times.My answer is simple."
Because I'm a son of Wisconsin.
"Whenever today's problems seem like too much to bear, I remember what my parents' generation faced."
"They overcame a Depression -- fought a world war -- and returned to farms and factories and built an economy that, for all its challenges, remains the envy of the world."
"When I remember what they accomplished, and I look at what we face, I think: We can do this, and we can be better for it."
All we need is a government worthy of its people.
The state of our government is troubled.
But the State of Wisconsin is as vibrant as ever.
Thank you and let's get to work.
