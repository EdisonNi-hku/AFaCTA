SENTENCES
"Speaker Wallace, President Scott, members of the Supreme Court, my partner Buddy MacKay, members of the Cabinet, members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, my fellow Floridians: This year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of our statehood."
"As we gather in Tallahassee at our state capitol -- to do the people's business -- we have an opportunity to reflect on the Florida of yesterday, today and tomorrow."
"YESTERDAY In 1513, the great explorer Ponce De Leon sighted a land he called ""La Florida"" -- the land of flowers."
"When Florida entered the union back in 1845, there were only about 65,000 people scattered around the entire state -- a population that could comfortably fit into Joe Robbie Stadium."
Florida entered the union at the same time as Iowa.
"During Congressional debate over the statehood issue, Representative Samuel F. Vinton, of Ohio, predicted that Florida was so remote that it would always be smaller in population than Iowa."
Florida and history have proven Representative Vinton very wrong.
"Today, Florida is one of the fastest growing states in the nation."
We started as a vast frontier of swamp and forest -- and became 20th largest state with a population of 2.7 million by 1950.
"Today, our more than 13 million people make Florida the fourth largest state."
Our great cities and small towns have put us on the map as a world-class destination -- a state that has something for everyone.
"Just before Florida joined the union in 1845, the territorial Assembly wanted Congress to divide the area into two parts -- split at the Suwannee River."
That request was properly denied.
"And, as Spessard Holland once observed: ""Florida has not been split geographically, nor divided in spirit."
"In the spirit of serving the state we love, each of us comes to these chambers and the work before us with an intent to do what is right for our people."
You follow legislators through our history -- and I'm proud to be one -- who have helped make Florida a trail-blazer in democracy - - fighting to open up our government and its records to the people.
These leaders have secured a place in our history because they put the needs of the people first.
"Today, as we look back to celebrate Florida's history, we also must have the vision and courage to look forward -- to secure Florida's future."
"During this 1995 session, we have the unique opportunity to make tomorrow's history."
TODAY We are nearly at the doorway of a new century.
The people have entrusted us with great responsibility to do what is right -- not what is easy.
"This session, we observe another first -- at least in our recent history."
A Senate under control of Republicans -- and the House under control of the Democrats.
What does this mean for the people?
"A session of bickering, gridlock, one-upmanship?I trust not."
I don't think Republicans who elected the Senate majority -- or Democrats who elected the House majority -- voted for or wanted THAT.
I trust we will come together in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation to do the people's business.
Well -- what is the State of the State?
It's pretty darn good -- but there's much more we can do to make it even better.
Let me give you a few comparisons.
"* CRIME-- When I spoke to you four years ago, criminals were serving less than 36 per cent of their sentences."
"Now, convicted criminals entering prison will stay behind bars 75 per cent of their sentences."
"And, with our budget request -- and going up to 150 per cent of capacity -- they will be serving 85 per cent."
We have a new Department of Juvenile Justice.
We've formed partnerships with local communities to provide boot camps.
And we just signed contracts for three Youthful Offender Prisons.
* WELFARE REFORM -- We passed a bi-partisan welfare reform plan and Florida obtained a federal waiver for the two largest demonstration projects in the country.
Early results from Escambia show our plan will get people off the dole and on to work.
We're asking you to allow us to add at least five more counties this session.
* ENVIRONMENT -- The costly Everglades lawsuit is settled and the cleanup has begun.
Kissimmee Restoration is underway.
Two agencies have been combined.
We're now looking at entire Ecosystems -- rather than separate pieces.P-2000 has been funded.
Uniformity in Wetlands definitions has been achieved.
Permitting has been streamlined and simplified.
One-stop permitting is becoming a reality.
Greenways now cover our state -- ensuring that all of our citizens can enjoy Florida's natural beauty for generations to come.
* HEALTH CARE -- Florida's health care costs increased more than 20 per cent the year I became Governor.
"This year, those costs decreased by 11 per cent."
That's ten times better than the national average.
This means more than $3 billion is added to Florida's economy.
This is happening because we lead the nation in going to managed care and a market-driven health delivery system.
"(If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
We don't need a separate Department of Health.
Our Community Health Purchasing Alliances began to work just last June.
"Now, eight months later, more than 6,000 businesses and more than 28,000 workers and their families have medical coverage."
Prices are 25-50 per cent cheaper than what's offered outside the CHPAs -- and more than half of those companies and their employees had no coverage before the CHPAs.
"Now, companies in the CHPAs with one to 50 employees are receiving these reductions."
Companies OUTSIDE also are demanding and receiving lower rates.
Those of us who have health care coverage are getting it cheaper -- but there are still two million of our people who have no coverage.We have unfinished business.
"* EDUCATION -- Since 1991, our public school dropout rate has been reduced from 6.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent."
Thousands of more students are staying in school.
"There were no full service schools when I became Governor -- but now there are nearly 450, and my budget will increase that number by another 138 school sites."
Our focus has been putting the classroom first -- and we have increased the ratio of teachers to administrators as one measurement of that commitment.
Teenage pregnancy has declined by seven per cent.
"(2,000 fewer teens having unwanted babies."
Every school now has an improvement council of parents and teachers.
School accountability was a dream.
"Now, Tallahassee no longer calls the shots."
We're in the fourth year of school accountability.
Every school receives its own report card.
Parents and teachers now are key to running the system.
I applaud Commissioner Brogan on his initiative to return more power to local schools.
We must grade counties and schools on the kind of students they produce -- and let them decide how to do it.
We know our community colleges are the best in the country.
But they are under great strain.
Our universities are excellent -- but way too few of our children get to use them.
Florida has miles to go to have a world-class education system.
Redoubling our efforts for public education is not a partisan issue.
But limited resources and competing priorities may restrict our ability to do all that needs to be done for our schools in this legislative session.
That's why we may consider coming back together later this year in a special session devoted to education: putting the classroom first.
"* ELDER AFFAIRS -- Four years ago, we had no Department of Elder Affairs -- even though by referendum, the people had mandated it."
"Now, we have a lean Department that last year generated more than 3.5 million hours of volunteer services to help elders throughout our state -- a savings of $44 million dollars for our state."
This Department does an excellent job -- and we must transfer the remaining elder services to it.
"In addition, we must protect elders from becoming victims of abuse by stiffening the penalties for such abuse."
"JOBS As we lead Florida toward the next century, I would like us to create a new paradigm -- a rubric through which we address our issues."
"A way in which we can work together regardless of party, race, ideology, gender, ethnic background.It's JOBS."
"Good, clean, high-wage, challenging, fulfilling jobs - - and lots of them."
Government is not too effective in mandating things.
But government can set incentives and take away dis- incentives.
Government can't create real jobs.
But government can level the playing field -- perhaps tilt it in the private sector's favor -- to allow it to create jobs.
Why select jobs as the new paradigm?
Simply because good jobs are the key to dealing with all of Florida's problems and needs.
"Without a growing supply of jobs, we can't solve the crime problem."
Punishment is not enough -- and it's far too expensive.
We will not succeed in welfare reform without jobs.
We cannot enjoy the quality of life we have inherited without a sound economic base -- which requires jobs.
We can't afford the education system we must have without good jobs for a sound tax base.
"So, what are the steps we must take to allow job creation?"
"Our current regulatory structure saps our economic vitality, creates endless delays, requires huge costs -- both real and political."
That is why we must slay the hydra-headed monster of over-regulation.
I have tasked Buddy to be my giant killer.(He loves an impossible task.
We're committed to reducing state regulations by at least 50 per cent.
"More than that, we're committed to changing the way we carry out public policy: to stop being the policeman -- seeking to punish our citizens -- and start being a partner, seeking our citizens' help in effecting necessary requirements for public protection."
"I've been traveling around Florida, talking with local citizens and business people."
They are telling me that all too often they get bogged down when government drags its feet over rules and regulations.
Our businesses and citizens are demanding timely action and answers from government.
"For them, time is money -- literally."
"Sometimes a quick answer, either yes or no, can make a world of difference."
"Recently, I sent each of you a copy of a book I read called ""The Death of Common Sense,"" by Philip Howard."
This book outlines why the public is so angry.
This book shows how rules and regulations are choking American government -- and business.
The book identifies PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE -- and it is the rules and regulations in our government.
This is not just Florida's problem -- it is the nation's problem.
"However, you and I have the opportunity to help Florida lead the nation out of this swamp -- and to gain very favorable publicity for our state in the process."
I'm pleased to report on Buddy's progress.
"Here's what we've done already: There are more than 10,000 rules and regulations just in the agencies under control of the Governor.Ten thousand rules."
"In just two months time -- by making this 50 percent goal an imperative to those agencies -- we already have identified nearly 3,500 rules that should be eliminated."
That's nearly 34% per cent just in those agencies.
And we're just getting started.
But remember -- the easy ones come first.
"Let me show you what 3,500 rules look like."
"(LIFT pile of rules high up and thump down on table) That's 3,500 rules."
"And it feels like the weight of the world burdening our businesses, our schools and our future."
"Now, I've called on the members of the Cabinet and other leaders of our government to pitch in to help -- and to pitch out as many of the state's nearly 28,000 total rules and regulations as possible."
"€ At the Department of Transportation, Ben Watts has come up with a bold and dramatic answer: eliminate all the rules."
Make the top managers accountable for decisions they make -- and put in place a process to resolve disputes over their decisions.
I'm asking you to support this plan -- it's a significant step on the road to rules reform.
€ Secretary Wetherell and the Department of Environmental Protection have a demonstration project in Duval County that is working to get businesses into compliance as its number one goal -- with enforcement as a last resort.
This project stresses cooperation over confrontation and it is achieving excellent results.
She will ask to broaden this to other areas.
This is the kind of common sense approach we need to take.
"€ Secretary Shelley, at the Department of Community Affairs, proposes state review of small amendments to local comprehensive plans -- amendments involving 10 acres or less -- be abolished."
That's 40 percent of the state's oversight of comprehensive plan amendments.
I'm also directing DCA to be more flexible in the administration of the state's growth management laws.
I'm glad Speaker Wallace and President Scott join me in sharing this goal.
And members of the Cabinet already have begun the process of taking action -- such as Commissioner Brogan's plan to eliminate all rules and laws that restrain local school districts from making their own decisions.
There is more that we can do together.
The cornerstone of our joint attack should be to pass a bill that would say to our people that all agency and department rules now in effect would be repealed at the close of the 1995 regular session of the legislature --- except those designated by me or you to keep in effect.
I will give you my recommendations for rules to remain in effect within three or four weeks.
I believe this in the best plan to relieve our citizens of the burden placed on their lives by unnecessary rules and regulations.
We can give back to the people the right to control their destiny.
the power to shape their future.
"Current law requires any state agency charged with enforcing or carrying out statutory enactments to adopt rules and regulations, whether they're needed or not."
This statute -- 120.535 -- should be repealed at once.
That will send a bipartisan message: Florida is no longer home to red tape and bureaucratic stagnation.
Let us make this great challenge one of our legacies for Florida: to stop the insanity of rules and regulations and start the rule of common sense.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT One of Florida's most dynamic business leaders is with us today.
Dick Nunis -- President and CEO of Walt Disney World -- also is Chairman of the Florida Council of 100.
Dick has worked with me and Buddy to conduct a series of economic development forums across our state.
"Without exception, in every one of these meetings, a now-familiar theme is developing."
"These business people -- who are accustomed to winning in all they do --are frustrated and angry because our state is losing out to Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina when it comes to attracting new industry."
"They don't want to concede this competition for high-tech, high-wage jobs -- and neither do I."
That's why I'm asking you to help build a stronger economy for our state by strengthening the public/private partnership -- Enterprise Florida.
It's time to put Florida in a stronger position to win -- by making sure we have all the arrows in our quiver.
This year we have a great opportunity to use the power of public/private partnerships to improve our economic development efforts.
I call on you to help us privatize the Florida Department of Commerce.
This action will help us attract resources and talent of private- sector business leaders in economic development initiatives.
This new direction will boost Enterprise Florida in its critical mission.
€ We want to continue providing businesses with access to venture capital and job training.
"And, we want to continue to develop and market Florida technology -- in Florida."
"€ In its first 18 months, Enterprise Florida's Quick Response Training program trained more than 10,000 workers for challenging and rewarding new jobs."
"€ This program has demonstrated tremendous returns on our state investment -- with six-and-a-half-million dollars in state funds, we have leveraged $80 million dollars in private sector money."
"For every state dollar spent, we received $12 worth of training through this program."
"The real prize is we kept or brought 10,000 jobs to Florida that we could have lost without this program."
"Join us in transferring the remainder of our economic development efforts to this partnership, which has a bottom-line mentality."
"WELFARE REFORM The Escambia County demonstration project in welfare reform has shown us the essential elements that are necessary to make the transition from welfare to work: job training, day care and health care."
The incentives all are wrong in an existing system that provides health care for those who don't work.
Yet two million Floridians without health coverage are working people and their families.
"This is a major dis-incentive to welfare reform and to good, high- value jobs."
FLORIDA HEALTH SECURITY Florida Health Security would allow us to provide coverage to more than one million additional working Floridians and their families.
It will be financed with more than $5 billion dollars over the next five years by putting Medicaid recipients under managed care.
"The federal savings will be about $3.4 billion dollars -- and our federal waiver allows us to use that, with our state savings, to provide access to health care for these one million people."
It doesn't require any new taxes.There are no mandates.
It's a free market plan with no additional bureaucracy.
One million people will no longer go to the emergency room and transfer the cost to private insurers and taxpayers.
"Last year, a number of you said: ""Good idea -- but the feds haven't approved the waiver."
I'd vote for it if you get this waiver.Well -- we've got it.
"Now, we are generating state savings as well as federal savings."
You may be tempted to take the state savings and spend it someplace else.
"If you do, you are giving up the federal savings."
We have great debates about one-hundred-million or two-hundred- million dollars.
But this is three-and-a-half-BILLION dollars.
These are our people's dollars.
Help me to keep them in Florida.
"Today, no other state will get the good deal that Florida has."
"And, with the move to block grants, Florida and the other growth states will greatly suffer."
We have a contract with the feds for these monies: $3.4 billion for five years.We must not lose that chance.
"We can design the program so that if the feds renege, we can pull out and lose nothing."
TOMORROW Freeing up our businesses by cutting the red tape.
Using the best talent of our business leaders -- and leveraging our money with theirs to give us a competitive edge.
Helping provide health coverage for Florida's workers and their families.
These are three efforts that can provide positive incentives to help Florida be a business-friendly state -- and create those high-wage jobs we must have to be World Class.
I ask you to join me as we respond to Florida's most critical needs with an honest plan that puts our people first.
"Together, we can help our people and help our state.Thank you.God Bless."
