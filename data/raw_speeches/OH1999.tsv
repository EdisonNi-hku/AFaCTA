Speaker Davidson - President Finan - Members of the General Assembly - Lt. Governor O'Connor - Chief Justice Moyer and members of the Supreme Court - elected officials - Cabinet members - friends and fellow citizens - thanks for joining us today.
Twenty-three years ago I joined this Assembly as a member of the People's House.
I recall fondly my colleagues who brought their distinct styles from every corner of Ohio and the lively - sometimes raucous - debates on the issues of that time.
Many of which, I might add, are still very much with us today.
It was quite an experience to work with the urban and suburban legislators who were sometimes out-witted by the Cornstalk Brigade.
We had legendary leaders such as Chuck Kurfess, who led majority and minority caucuses, C. J. McLin, a civil rights pioneer, and Speaker Vern Riffe, who spoke rarely but carried a big gavel.
I felt then the sweep of history in this chamber, which has since regained its majesty and beauty under the leadership of Senator Finan, and has maintained its decorum and dignity under the steady hand of Speaker Davidson.
We owe both of you our gratitude.
Governor Jim Rhodes delivered the State of the State speech during my first year and as I recall, the syntax was fractured, but the message was clear: Jobs and Progress.
I watched it all, as you do today, from a seat in this Chamber, wondering what the view looked like from the place where Lincoln stood.
Well, I've got to confess, the view is pretty good from up here!
It is a great honor to serve as Ohio's 67th Governor and to share with you the State of our State and our plan for the coming years.
Let me begin by thanking each of you - especially Minority Leaders Jack Ford and Ben Espy - for the bipartisan hand of friendship you've extended during the first days of our administration.
I pledge to continue the strong partnership that we've forged on behalf of the citizens of our state.
One of the benefits of being Governor is the mail I receive from school children around Ohio.
They sometimes thank me for things I wish I'd done.
I've got to confess to one of my correspondents, Luis Perez: Luis, I really can't take credit for building Toys-R-Us and K-Mart in your neighborhood.
Another fourth grader at Durling Elementary in Lorain, Dexter Fields, is here with us today.
Thanks for joining us!
"Dexter wrote ""have a nice time as Governor,"" and asked ""Did you know that this is a branch of power?"""
Well, Dexter, I'm learning, but I'm also learning that we share power with the legislative and judicial branches, who are present today in this Chamber.
The Constitution works best when we each understand our own branch of power and its limitations.
Dexter went on to sum up my job as Governor.
"""You have a responsibility,"" he wrote, ""and you have to do a lot of stuff."
Yes Dexter, we certainly have a lot of stuff to do.
"In my Inaugural Address I promised to present an ""opportunity agenda"" to the Legislature and the people of Ohio."
Today I want to set the cornerstones of that agenda.
An agenda that, while ambitious, will stand as the foundation for the future we want to build for our state.
A future with opportunity for every child to get a good education in a safe, secure classroom - opportunity for Ohioans to obtain good jobs at good wages - opportunity to keep more of their hard-earned money - and opportunity to improve the quality of their daily lives.
Nothing will provide greater opportunity in life for Dexter Fields and his classmates than a good education.
That's why we have funded schools first in our budget.
The sacrifices of many state agencies and the hard work of the Legislature have enabled us to commit a historic level of financial resources to education.
Nearly 50 cents out of every dollar of new state spending will go to schools!
We'll spend more than $13 billion on primary and secondary education in the next two years.
That's an all-time record!
Our budget will fully fund the second and third years of the four-year phase-in of the new school funding formula enacted in House Bill 650 on a bipartisan basis.
Spending for basic aid, special education, vocational education, and transportation will all increase more rapidly than inflation.
State aid for all special, vocational, and gifted students will be funded on a per-pupil basis and equalized to take into account the difference in property tax wealth among school districts.
When combined with the current budget, state education spending will rise by more than 33 percent over a four-year period.
That's almost four times the rate of inflation!
Just as important as operating funds, we must provide adequate school buildings for our children.
This is a new responsibility the state has assumed during the current decade.
Since 1991, the state has authorized more than $1.5 billion to help school districts replace and repair school buildings.
As long as I'm Governor, I will honor my pledge to propose at least $300 million per year in new spending for school buildings.
But, we can and we must do more.
Because our economy is strong and our spending under control, our surplus this year is expected to be at least $400 million.
Today I invite you to join me in committing to spend 100 percent of the state's surplus funds at the end of this biennium for school buildings and technology.
When combined with monies already approved in the current capital budget, school building and technology assistance would then exceed $1 billion over a two year period!
But money alone will not improve education.
New dollars will not produce results until every school is laser-focused on improving the academic achievement of all students.
To raise achievement levels we must concentrate on four goals.
First, ensure that every student learns how to read.
In three years, students now in first grade will not advance from fourth to fifth grade unless they pass the reading proficiency test.
And since fewer than half of fourth graders passed the most recent test, we are facing an enormous challenge.
I want to thank members of the Ohio House for unanimously passing House Bill 1, our OhioReads initiative that is designed to address this challenge.
My budget will contain $25 million in classroom and community-reading grants to assist schools in training teachers and intervening early with students through tutoring, technology, and extra time on task.
We are seeking to recruit 20,000 volunteer tutors to work one-on-one to improve students reading skills.
I urge each of you to join me and become a reading tutor for a child in need.
We will support our reading campaign in other ways as well.
By providing funds to encourage teachers to become reading specialists.
And since the foundation for reading must be built before kindergarten, we'll train over 2,000 Head Start and other pre-school teachers to teach pre-reading skills to children before they enter school.
Second, we must hold schools accountable for results.
This means rewarding schools that improve and intervening to assist schools that need help.
It also means reconstituting schools which are not getting the job done and providing new options for parents whose children are trapped in failing schools.
Our budget includes $10 million per year in Incentive Grants to reward schools that improve from year to year on proficiency test scores, attendance, and graduation rates.
You know, we hear too much about schools that are not educating kids.
Isn't it time we recognize schools that are doing a good job, that are getting better year after year?
Our budget includes $25 million to provide assistance for school improvement based on results from district report cards.
These funds will support special intervention efforts for districts on academic watch and academic emergency.
To give more choices to parents of children in under-performing schools, I propose to expand the State's Community School Law to permit charter schools to be established in any district on academic emergency status.
Third, we must significantly expand training opportunities for the professional development of teachers and principals.
As a former teacher who has visited more than 150 schools in recent years, I know that good teachers produce good students.
We have thousands of courageous and talented teachers, but if we are to improve education for all our children, we must create a teacher corps that is second to none.
Our budget provides funding for a Governor's Teacher in Residence and more than $80 million for professional development of teachers and other school leaders.
It will also create financial incentives for teachers to enhance their professional skills.
We must assure that Ohio remains a leader in the number of National Board Certified Teachers.
The budget provides funding for 400 teachers per year to pursue national board certification and increases by $2,500 the annual pay of each teacher who becomes certified.
We've all seen dynamic schools led by dynamic principals.
And to help more principals lead their schools toward greater academic achievement, we will fund a new Principal's Leadership Academy.
Fourth, our schools must be safe and drug free.
Students can't learn and teachers can't teach if violence and disruption rule the classroom.
I want to thank members of the Senate for their prompt action on Senate Bill 1 that will create school safety zones and increase penalties for those who commit crimes on or near school property.
To keep schools drug free, our budget will provide funds to help districts hire full-time substance-abuse coordinators for drug abuse prevention and education programs.
Finally, we have set aside $20 million in each budget year for alternative schools in urban, suburban, and rural districts.
These schools will provide needed discipline for some students, and will improve the classroom learning environment.
We simply cannot permit a handful of disruptive students to interfere with the education of all others!
Before leaving the subject of education, let me state firmly my belief that every child can learn no matter who they are or where they live!
And to back up that belief, I want to introduce a remarkable teacher who is getting remarkable results.
Cheryl Zenko teaches in an inner-city school in Cleveland, where almost all students come from families living at or below the poverty level.
Most students in the school are failing proficiency tests at all grade levels.
But last year in Room 222, each one of Cheryl's students passed all five parts of the fourth grade proficiency test.
Cheryl is a certified reading specialist, and also a National Board Certified Teacher.
She expects and demands excellence.
She believes in teacher accountability.
And she supports early intervention for non-reading students.
"Cheryl deployed a classroom management plan based on assertive discipline, and taught her students to develop a sense of responsibility by creating a program called ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Kids."
She also implemented her own tutoring program, asking all students to come to school an hour early from January through March.
It was voluntary, but the kids came.
Cheryl, thank you for showing us all what we must do in every classroom and, more importantly, that it can be done!
If we are to help Ohioans succeed in the next century, then we must make sure our higher education system is up to the task.
As global competition intensifies, and as new technologies emerge day after day, advanced education must be available to every Ohioan.
Over the next two years, we will make higher education more accessible to Ohio students by making it more affordable to Ohio families.
Total funding will rise nearly twice the rate of inflation.
We'll increase and expand eligibility for Ohio Instructional Grants.
And for the first time, students choosing to attend college year-round can receive a grant for a fourth quarter or a third semester.
In order to encourage students to attend college and workers to go back and improve their skills, our budget provides a $2,500 tax deduction in each of the first two years of college.
This deduction will benefit an estimated 300,000 students and their families.
And to keep Ohio's two-year campuses affordable, we will more than double Access Grants to allow them to hold tuition increases below three percent, and at many schools, even below two percent.
Education and job training go hand-in-hand, or in this day and age, keyboard-to-keyboard.
As our economy of the 21st century becomes more high-tech and recreates itself before our very eyes, so too must state government recreate the way it approaches workforce training and development.
The fact is, finding skilled, well-trained workers is the number one economic challenge of our time.
If we fail to meet this challenge, the good jobs will not stay in Ohio.
And if the good jobs leave, our children and grandchildren will not be far behind.
By merging the departments of Human Services and Employment Services we will establish a seamless service delivery system dedicated to statewide workforce development.
"The new ""Department of Job and Family Services"" will create one-stop-shops to provide local job training, enhancing our ability to meet the needs of workers seeking jobs and employers seeking qualified employees."
One such worker I want you to meet is Kimberly Brown.
When Kimberly applied for job training in Dayton, she was a single mother of three receiving public assistance.
She had low math skills and lacked a high school diploma.
After enrolling, she worked hard to improve her skills and earn her GED.
Kimberly completed her training at Miami Valley Career Technology Center.
She now works as a nurse and earns $17.00 an hour.
Kimberly, your courage changed your life, your skills and job training gave you the chance, and your commitment brought the success that you and your children now enjoy.
You are an inspiration and a wonderful role model!
We need more students preparing for technology-based careers in health, manufacturing, engineering, computer-aided drafting, and information systems.
Only 8,000 students are now enrolled in tech-prep programs, which are designed jointly by high schools, two-year colleges, and employers to provide rigorous academic and job-specific training.
That's not enough.
Let's set a goal today of having 35,000 students enrolled in tech-prep in four years.
Our budget contains incentive funds to help meet this ambitious goal.
And finally, to help Ohio employers prepare their workers for the new economy, I am proposing dramatic increases in money used for employee training.
Industrial Training Grants will be increased by more than 40 percent over the biennium.
And we'll more than triple funds available at two-year colleges to help local businesses become more productive by upgrading the knowledge and skills of their workers.
But even if our workers are trained, Ohio runs the risk of being left behind if we are not competitive in the global marketplace.
To improve our ability to attract and retain the good jobs of the 21st century, we must take several steps.
First, Ohio needs a competitive market for electricity.
This is a difficult issue, and I applaud the work that has been done to date.
But time is running out.
Most of our neighbor states have acted and improved their ability to compete for our jobs.
I know we can enact legislation to benefit both business and residential customers - without harming schools.
Let's work together and let's get it done now!
Second, we must renew our tax credit for machinery and equipment, and extend our enterprise zone law.
In the constant competition for jobs, Ohio cannot afford to unilaterally disarm.
Without a strong incentive program, we would not have kept the Jeep plant in Toledo, International Paper in Clermont County, or Aristech Chemical in Scioto County.
Most importantly, our incentive program is critical to keeping GM in Lordstown.
This is the state's top job retention priority.
We must do everything necessary to keep Lordstown up and running!
Next, let's build on Ohio's impressive network of technology resources.
We are earmarking $5 million for technology action grants to support research and development projects, and $2 million for a new Edison Center for Information Technology.
Fourth, we must be smarter in managing growth in every corner of Ohio.
Ohio is a heartland state filled with diverse communities.
"As we seek to balance the spread of metropolitan centers with the preservation of precious farmland, we must also work to rebuild the urban cores of our ""mother cities."
That's why we'll provide $10 million per year in Urban Redevelopment Loans to clean up and reuse brownfields and other urban sites.
And I've asked Development Director Lee Johnson to lead a newly created Urban Revitalization Task Force, composed of mayors and economic development experts.
This group will develop an action agenda for rebuilding our urban cores.
They will report back to me in one year, and we will submit legislation to you shortly thereafter.
I have just shared with you our plans for improving education, training our workforce, and building a better climate for new jobs.
Let me now turn to issues that directly affect the quality of our lives.
No issue threatens Ohio families more than substance abuse.
You've heard me say how proud I am that my wife, Hope, Ohio's First Lady, will help lead our crusade against drug and alcohol abuse.
Hope, thank you for all your love and support and for your lifelong commitment to positive youth development!
Sadly, substance abuse is often the greatest obstacle to happy, productive lives.
While progress has been made in Ohio, much remains to be done.
The devastation of alcohol and other drugs too often results in violence, illiteracy, teen pregnancy, and crime.
I've already noted our commitment to help schools hire full-time substance abuse coordinators.
In addition, we're providing $500,000 for development of local Drug Free Community Coalitions involving businesses, civic groups and the faith community.
And we're adding $1.5 million for Treatment Alternatives to Street Crimes to refer offenders to community-based substance abuse treatment programs.
We will also create more drug courts to help non-violent offenders break the pattern of repeat criminal conduct.
Whatever we can do to combat drug abuse and keep our streets safer will make a difference in the lives of all Ohioans, especially our senior citizens.
Our senior population is the fastest growing segment of society.
We know that most seniors who face the problem of failing health want to remain independent and in their own homes.
Therefore, we will increase funding for PASSPORT, allowing more than 24,000 older Ohioans to receive home care and support services in the next two years.
We will also expand the Homestead Exemption by raising the income cap by 10 percent and indexing it to the cost of inflation.
And let's recognize the sacrifices made by family members who are caring for elderly relatives - especially those who are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.
Sam Morris is one such family member.
His wife, Jane, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 20 years ago.
For the next ten years, Sam looked after her in their Worthington home.
He took Jane on trips and out to eat, and kept their lives as normal as possible, for as long as possible.
As Jane's condition worsened, Sam brought her to Willow Brook Christian Nursing Home, where he now spends part of every day combing her hair and caring for her.
"""What I'm doing for Jane,"" Sam says, ""is what ought to be done for any person in her condition - to provide compassionate, loving care at all times."
"Sam says, ""You don't give up, regardless."
As a volunteer for the Alzheimer's Association, Sam is now helping other families facing this disease.
"He is quick to serve his family and fellow citizens, but he is just as quick to recognize that ""…as a caregiver, you can't do it all."
You've got to take care of yourself.
Sam, we want to help you and thousands of Ohio caregivers do just that.
So, we are expanding our Alzheimer's respite care program to assist an additional 2,400 caregivers.
Sam, thanks for inspiring us and being with us today!
It's time to refocus our entire health care system on the quality of care provided to patients.
"My Patient Protection Plan, already introduced in the House, includes ""fast track"" insurance appeals, a ""health insurance hotline,"" expanded access to women's health services, and holds health insurers accountable for medical decisions that cause harm to a patient."
These proposals have raised concerns, but I am confident we can reach common ground.
What's at stake is no less than the health and well-being of Ohio's citizens, and I urge you to pass our Patient Protection Plan as soon as possible!
Further, we must increase access to medical care.
That's why I have proposed three new tax deductions to make medical care more affordable: · To help uninsured Ohioans purchase coverage; · To encourage all Ohioans to buy long-term care insurance; and · To allow a state tax deduction for excessive medical expenses, as is now permitted under federal law.
We will also expand health coverage to the children of our state's working poor, those in families making up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
This will allow an additional 27,000 children to receive medical care, and will enable more families to move off the welfare rolls - and onto payrolls - without depriving their kids of health care coverage.
We need to do everything possible to keep our kids healthy - and that means keeping them away from tobacco.
Thanks to the efforts of Attorney General Betty Montgomery, our state will receive a substantial amount of money over a period of years from the tobacco settlement.
But questions remain.
When will we get it?
How will we use it?
And will the federal government lay claim to a share of the payments awarded to the states?
Next week, we will ask the Controlling Board to establish a separate fund to receive monies from the tobacco settlement.
And to determine how those settlement funds should be spent, I will work with legislative leaders to appoint a bipartisan Task Force made up of legislators, the Attorney General, and members of my administration.
I will ask that Task Force to report back to us within 60 days.
And I will urge its members to make their first priority the goal of reducing the number of underage smokers in Ohio.
It is tragic that 35 percent of our high school students smoke, that each year in Ohio 65,000 kids under 18 become daily smokers, and that nearly 20,000 people die each year in Ohio from smoking-related illness.
And you need to know that I stand firm in my commitment to vigorously oppose any attempt by the federal government to take our tobacco settlement dollars.
Mr. President and members of Congress, keep your hands off of Ohio's money!
"As Dexter Fields might have predicted, we're going to do ""…a lot of stuff."
"The ""stuff"" I have talked about today is the framework for an aggressive opportunity agenda."
An agenda which will improve education and training, expand economic well being, help families become more self-sufficient, and enhance Ohio's quality of life.
You've heard me say how proud I am to continue the family tradition of public service that began over 160 years ago when my great-great-grandfather settled in Cincinnati.
I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as Governor.
We live in a great state.
And we can make it even better.
So I ask you, the members of the General Assembly, to join me in making the most of our historic opportunity.
As I said on Inauguration Day, let us act now to secure the future for ourselves, today, and for our children, tomorrow.
Thank you, and may God bless you all.
