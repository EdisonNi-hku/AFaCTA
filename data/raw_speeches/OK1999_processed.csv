SENTENCES
"Before I begin the formal “thank yous” and the formal presentation, I want to make note of the fact, Lieutenant Governor Fallin, Madam President that in this committee that brought me to this place, we have the oldest member of the Legislature and the youngest member of the Legislature."
"As a Republican, I am worried that they are Democrats, but Representative Corn and Representative Betty Boyd, two wonderful people doing so much for the State to be and so much for the State in the past."
I would like to make special note of them.
"Representative Boyd encouraged me to make note of the fact that the youngest and oldest were in attendance, but she was not going to say who was who."
You would have to figure that one out.
"Lieutenant Governor Fallin, President Pro Tempore Taylor, Speaker Benson, Leader Snyder, Leader Morgan, members of the Judiciary, and members of the House and Senate of Oklahoma, this is a unique time for Oklahoma."
Because it is a millennium opportunity for all of us to come together as one people to the best we can for Oklahomans.
I am the only Governor in the history of this state that has served in both houses.
So I feel at ease and comfortable here with you.
"Secondly, this is my fifth State of the State, midpoint in my service as Governor."
"It is an opportunity for me and it is an opportunity for all of us as Oklahomans, first, to work together for the best interest of our State."
"Instead of having a formal written text, I would like to digress and engage in a conversation with you and with the people of Oklahoma detailing from our look back together what we have accomplished over the course of the last four years."
"And our look forward together, what it is we can accomplish in the next four years."
"Because when it is all said and done, this is not a competition between Republicans and Democrats, it is a competition for Oklahoma."
"Our adversary is not each other, our adversary is Texas and California and Pennsylvania and Florida and other states of the Union."
"Some with Republican Legislatures, some with Republican Governors, some with Democratic Legislatures and obviously, some with Democratic Governors."
"In my Inaugural message on January 11th, I outlined to you a series of goals that I proposed that we reach for as a people."
"Because those goals were the right thing for us as Oklahomans to do, I was very pleased that men and women of good will, of both parties, received those goals with an open mind and with a lot of good will."
The comments from all concerned were to the effect that these goals were worthy goals.
These goals were reachable goals.
"These were goals that we, as an Oklahoma family, should attempt to achieve.There were seven."
"Equal the National Per Capita Personal Income, how much our people make, by the year 2025 in one generation."
Surpass the national ACT average by the year 2005.
"By 2010, assure that one Oklahoman in three has a college degree."
"By 2010, cut our divorce rate by one third."
"By 2010, cut the out-of-wedlock birth rate by one third."
"By 2010, reduce alcohol and drug addiction by one half."
"By 2010, cut child abuse and neglect in half.These are bipartisan goals."
"And they are bipartisan goals worthy of achievement because they will make our population richer, not only economically, but educationally as well as spiritually."
These are the right goals as Oklahomans seek to achieve.
"I would ask the Legislature to consider this budget message, and yes it is in balanced."
The debate in all of these measures over the course of the next Session and several Sessions that we aim to achieve these goals.
"That we seek to answer the question, “Will this bill advance the agenda of making us a richer society, economically, morally, educationally?” These will require a spirit of bipartisanship."
Look what we have accomplished in the spirit of bipartisanship over the course of the last four years.
"In the last ten years, Oklahoma created 300,000 jobs."
"Of those, 128,000 were created in the last three years."
Think of where we would be with collapsed energy and agriculture prices if we had not aggressively diversified.
"We, as a Legislature, you as a Legislature, we as an Administration, us together, continue the Quality Jobs Program which was so important and has been so mightily successful and is encouraging us to get new jobs and new employment in Oklahoma."
Welfare reform is working in Oklahoma.Our rolls are down by 58%.It did not happen by accident.
"We established that single, able-bodied people with no dependents between the ages of 18 and 50, would work and would not be entitled to food stamps."
"This was not easy to do, but we took the position that we, as a people, are best elevated by independence and responsibility and work."
That is the public policy of the State of Oklahoma.
To get people who can work working.
"We are a rich enough society to take care of those who are frail and elderly, those by virtue or physical or mental incapacity who can not take care of themselves."
"We are a rich enough society to take care of them, but we must not subsidize idleness or indolence."
"We must focus on work and responsibility so we can become a richer, more prosperous society.We have done it."
We have engaged in the largest road construction program ever in Oklahoma’s history.
"Some $3 billion over four years because we know “we build it, they will come.We know that."
"We made that commitment as a Legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike, to catch up infrastructure wise."
There are a lot of companies I have talked to that simply said they could not be here because we did not have a modern infrastructure.
"They will be here when we have one.Now, we are building one.Think of that."
No tax increase in building these roads.Not one hint of scandal.
What a contrast to the old Oklahoma.
"Nobody’s favorite bond council, nobody’s favorite contractor, these were competitively arrived at."
People throughout our State know that there is integrity in the process and that is a proud moment for the “New” Oklahoma.
We passed some of the toughest environmental regulations and legislation in the country.
We want to save the family farm.
"We want to encourage agriculture to be prosperous, but we understood that we could not permit our own nest to be defiled."
We could not wreck the water supply of our cities and towns.
We could not wreck the tourism opportunities that our lakes provide our people and our visitors.
The first Poultry Regulation Bill in the country and the toughest swine legislation anywhere in America.
The crime rate is down and has been down for the first time in seven years across the board.Why did that happen?
"Because we determined that those 3,000 chronic and violent offenders would be locked up."
"In a population state like ours, that is not growing as it should, there are only so many people out there to rob and kill and molest."
"If you take those who are chronic and those who are violent, those who are in the business of crime and lock them up, they will have less crime."
We together passed Tort Reform.
We said to small businesses in this State and to small businesses interested in locating in Oklahoma that this is a business-friendly environment.
Come here and you will be treated fairly.
We limited punitive damages to double actual damages in civil lawsuits and that was the right thing to do.
"We also invested mightily in common education, higher education and vo-tech."
I’ll speak about all of that in a few minutes.
We had the greatest increases and the greatest contributions ever in those very important areas to move us into the next prosperity century with a better educated workforce.
We passed the first cut in the state income tax in 50 years.
"We recognize that it is smart public policy to give more of our money to our people because it is their money, not ours."
"And, for them to make the decision in how to invest and what to invest is sound public policy."
We also reduced state employment by nearly 10% as a result of privatization of new prisons and privatization of University Hospital.
We moved those good women and men to the private sector.
We looked to those companies to pay taxes and not to consume taxes.
That too is prudent public policy.
All of these things were accomplished in a spirit of bipartisanship.
"The spirit of bipartisanship recognizing that we work for Oklahoma, not for our parties, but for Oklahoma."
It is important for us to do the best we can in the most creative way we can to make Oklahoma a better place.
I have looked back and now let us look at the present and the future and examine these goals and what we in a budget context should do to achieve them.
GOAL ONE: Raise Oklahoma’s Per Capita Personal Income to the national level by 2025.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this should be our most challenged goal."
"In one generation, make it possible for our people to earn what other people make.Why is that?"
Because we want to assure that our children and our grandchildren will remain in Oklahoma and come back to Oklahoma.
We do not want to be a little Ireland.
We do not want to export the best and brightest we have to other places.
We want them to be here because this is our home.This is their home.This is where they belong.
It is important that we reach that goal.
We are at 80% of the Nation’s Per Capita Income now.We are 44th in income.
The sixth poorest State in the Union.
"In the worst of the Depression, there were 13 states poorer than we."
"That was the time of the Jobes and the Dust Bowl.Today, only six are."
"In the worst of the Depression, we had eight Congressmen."
"Today, we look at the prospect of having only five."
"That is not a curse, that is a challenge for all of us to address the public policy implications of that and answer the question, “why has it happened?” We examined why it has happened."
"In a comprehensive analysis by Goals 2000, chaired by Bob Kerr, Jr. and Larry Brummett."
"Mr. Kerr, in particular, is no member of the vast right-wing conspiracy."
A bipartisan look at what we need to do to make Oklahoma rich.
To raise that Per Capita Income bar there were four answers and there are a couple more we ought to throw in there as well.
"First, infrastructure, we have got to build highways to attract business and industry.So we must stay the course."
"In the infrastructure investment that we have made to make sure that the roads and highways we need are, in fact, built.Secondly, tax policy.We tax everything."
It is important to reduce those taxes that discourage investment and saving and productivity.
"Last year we did something to permit us to catch up, we put our tax rate in the six’s not the seven’s."
"When you talk to business locators and you talk to small business owners, the one thing that chills them was Oklahoma’s high income tax."
"I am going to propose in this balanced budget, that we not only from 6 ¾ %, as we did last year, but this year, we reduce the income tax further to 6 ½ %.Three, college graduates."
"We are 70,000 college graduates short."
"Think where this budget would be if we had 70,000 people earning the income that college graduates are."
We would be in a mighty economic position.
That is exactly the position we ought to be.
"Raise the bar, raise the education levels, raise the income levels so our people can be more prosperous."
I will have more to say about how we get there in a minute.
"Lastly, of these four recommendations of Oklahoma 2000 is Right-to-work.I see my friends are back."
There are three others I would like to mention.
These four that I have just mentioned were mentioned specifically in the Goals 2000 Report.
"In an analysis by Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma University economists, why are we poor?What do we need to address it?Those were the four.I am going to add three more.Workers’ Comp."
"Our Workers’ Comp system, even though we have reformed it around the edges, is still very expensive."
It helps to be able to replace judges with fact-based judges focused on truly compensating the injured worker and not providing compensation to every case that walks in the door.
Workers’ Comp is still too expensive.
I am going to propose that this Legislature fairly consider stopping permanent disability awards for those individuals who return to work at the same salary or a greater salary.
This is one of the elements of the cost of the Workers’ Comp that drives it up.
It is one of the elements that needs to be addressed by the reform of this Legislature.Tort reform.
I mentioned in the last four years we addressed the issue of the spiraling costs of civil lawsuits.
"We need to be a place that is friendly to justice, friendly to the injured worker, but no more."
"In the case of Tort Reform, the unfinished business is to truly sanction the bringing of frivolous lawsuits."
"If you bring a frivolous lawsuit in Oklahoma, you pay the cost of the action."
The last of these seven proposals were addressed and recommended by Oklahoma 2000 and a bipartisan spirit by OSU and OU.
"The last three that we know collectively having worked in business development, many of you members here helped me over the course of the last number of years."
The last of the last three is the crime rate.
"It is no question that according to business locators and analysts, one of the quality of life issues, tax policy is one, obviously, the amenities of a good life is another, but the crime rate is very important.Oklahoma’s crime rate is down."
We have to continue that it be pushed down.
This Legislature will wrestle with the issue of Truth-in-Sentencing.
"Let me ask you to remember what we have here is not a Truth-in-Sentencing Bill that is capacity driven, but a Truth-in-Sentencing Bill that focuses on the safety of our people."
That is why we consider passing it.
So let us either focus on Truth-in-Sentencing that truly addresses the issue of the violent and chronic offenders or do not permit it to go into effect.
Do not let it happen and go back to the system that has worked and is working now.
The crime rate is down across the board and our public is safer and more secure.
"Oklahomans are too good, too smart and too capable to continue stagnating in the bottom tannin well."
"Government can not assure rising incomes, but it can create the right conditions."
"This year, let us put our faith in our people."
Let’s give them the tools to build a new prosperity into the next century.
"GOAL TWO: By the year 2010, one Oklahoman in three should have a college degree."
A number of the members of this Legislature attended last week’s Education Summit.
"The dinner we had before the formal summit started was graced by a speaker by the name of Dr. Benno Schmidt, head of the Edison Project and formerly the President of Yale."
He shared with us a statistic that came as a great surprise to many.
It should not come as a great surprise to those of us who want to build the State with a better educated workforce.
"He said in the year 1980, the difference between a high school graduate and a college graduate was 25%.In 1996, it was 100%.It is widening."
"For us to raise our incomes, for us to have a more productive labor workforce, for us to earn more money, and yes, encourage tax revenue to do the things that we want to do to make us a modern infrastructure society."
We have to have a better educated and a better paid workforce.
"The fact is a college degree will bring high value, high wage jobs to Oklahoma."
"We are at a point now, whether a number of companies that I am dealing with that simply are not able to expand here because we do not have the ready pool of college graduates.That must be addressed."
"Our budget, this budget, this balanced budget will continue to make higher education a significant priority."
We are going to dramatically increase funding in higher education.
"And also, I am going to propose that the State Regents be empowered to set tuition and fees."
There are two distinguished higher education leaders here today with us.One who served with me.
"We were both back benchers and is now President of the University of Oklahoma and is doing a superb job as President, David Boren, and the other is Dr. Holloway, the President of Langston."
Both of those men understand the importance of higher education.
"It is important that our comprehensive universities be second to none to any school in the United States, certainly any school in the region."
It is also important that Langston become the center for minority learning and enterprise in America.
Let us make sure that the minority learning enterprise experiment in Oklahoma City and Tulsa are successful.
Let me have President Boren and Dr. Holloway stand and be recognized.
GOAL THREE: Raise Oklahoma’s average ACT score to a level above the national level by the year 2005.
"The reality is we have a lot of kids that go to college, but a lot of them drop out."
Either they don’t see the need for it or they are simply not prepared.
"Right now we have to remediate depending on whose statistics you read, anywhere between 30% and 40% of our youngsters that go to college.That is unacceptable."
We are investing in common education.
We should demand that there be results.
"We need to follow the recommendations of the Education Summit representing the business community, small and large, all over Oklahoma as well as men and women of good will in education."
"Set goals, establish assessments, provide real school choice, provide a charter school law, real charter school reform, pass a tougher curriculum."
"You know House Bill 1017 required that 4 by 4 be taught, be provided in every school in Oklahoma."
"Four years of math, science, English and social studies."
We required that in House Bill 1017.
"Now, let’s make people take it."
"The harder the curriculum, the tougher the education, the more credentials, the better educated student, the better opportunity to go to college the better opportunity to remain in Oklahoma as a successful, prosperous member of the expanding workforce."
"Let us pay bonus salaries to teachers in science, math and those specialties that are tough to attract men and women of excellence to the classroom."
"Let us more importantly of all, this was a recommendation in our Summit, stop social promotion."
Cathy and I last year participated with a lot of parents in teaching reading to seniors in high school here in Oklahoma City.
Seniors who could not read beyond a fifth grade level.There were 200 of them.
How have we come to this point?
"We spend $5,000 a year for every one of those students times 12 years."
Sixty thousand dollars we spent on this youngster who can not read beyond a fifth grade level.Stunted for life.
It is going to be difficult for that individual or any of these individuals to find productive work.We have to address it.
"In stopping social promotion, we should require that students that fail the Iowa Basic Schools Test in grades 3 and 7 and to pass tests in grade 5 be held back and repeat the grade or be required to go to summer school."
They must be proficient in the year of their study before they are promoted.
"School choice, charter schools, tougher curriculums, no social promotion, bonus pay for teachers, continued funding for education, graduation exams, all of the requirements of an education workforce so that in the future, we are no longer here, those of us who came after us can look back and say this Legislature did mighty work to raise the bar, educate the workforce and make it possible for us to be truly a competitive new Oklahoma first world society."
"Finally, I want to turn to what some have called the Moral Goals I set in the Inaugural, dramatic reduction in rates of divorce, out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol addiction and child abuse."
"Yes it is true, that we in government can not legislate morality."
"But, we can certainly develop a legislative framework to ensure that good things happen to good people and that bad things do not happen to good people."
We can do what we can to address these social shortfalls that were identified in Goals 2000 as one of the reasons that we are held back.
"We have too much divorce, especially with children."
We have too many out-of-wedlock births.
We have too much violence against the young.
We have too much of those negative social indicators that simply make it impossible for us to be a prosperous society.
"GOAL FOUR: By the year 2010, reduce the divorce rate by one third."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you and I all know that not every marriage can survive."
"But let me tell you, there is something wrong with a good people in a good society when it is easier to get a marriage license than it is to get a hunting license."
There is something wrong when it is more difficult to get out of a Tupperware contract than it is to get out of a marriage contract with children.
Cathy and I will co-host a statewide conference on marriage and marriage readiness in March.
We are going to ask that the rabbis and the pastors and the priests of Oklahoma come together for the purpose of making sure that young people are ready for marriage.
"When they do enter the marriage contract, they understand this is a lifetime commitment."
"Our obligation as adults, especially adults with children, is to raise them in loving environments, to nurture them and care for them and educate them as a unit."
Remember the effects on children of divorce are significant.
"Two percent of children in two-parent families experience prolonged poverty, 2%."
Twenty-two percent of children in single-parent families are poor.
I would hope this Legislature would pass the Covenant Marriage Bill.
"An important piece of legislation that says to men and women, be prepared for marriage."
I would hope you would take that up at the earliest opportunity.
"GOAL FIVE: By 2010, reduce the out-of-wedlock birth rate by one third."
"The tragic fact is that youngsters who are born out-of-wedlock are more prone to be school dropouts, victims of abuse and neglect than children born with intact families."
Some months ago I had the opportunity to speak to a high school group in a small community of Oklahoma.
"In the course of my conversation in questions and answers, a girl in the back raised her hand and she said, “what do you think about out-of-wedlock births?” I said that I think they are immoral and they are wrong."
She said “would your answer be any different if I told you that I was six months pregnant.I said no.
It is immoral and it is wrong and you made a wrong choice.
"As a father of two girls, I have got to tell you that child has more of a likelihood of dropping out of school, being abused and neglected, being a drug dependent individual than if that child were born into an intact home.You made a wrong decision."
"You have no money, no education, no husband.You made a bad decision."
A young man afterwards came up to me and said “nobody in this school ever suggested that her decision was wrong.
No one in this valueless environment ever suggested to her that there was such a thing as wrongness in out-of-wedlock births.No one wanted to say that.I think that is wrong.
"Our schools and our colleges, we should take the position that there is certain conduct that is absolutely destructive."
This is it and we in Oklahoma have a serious problem with this particular conduct.
"I would encourage again educators, priests, rabbis, ministers, to focus on this on Sundays and Saturdays and address these issues.We are a believing people."
Over 70% of our people go to church at least twice a month.
There is simply no reason to have these kind of statistics in our State with that kind of commitment to religion as we have.
GOAL SIX: Reduce child abuse and neglect by half by the year 2010.
"In 1995 after the Murrah Building tragedy, we showed ourselves to be a tremendous people and then we read about Ryan Luke and Shane Coffman.This is awful."
Our children are our most precious crop.
We owe them the discipline and the love to assure them that they can become prosperous and productive members of the next generation.
This Legislature can play a role in fully funding the interdisciplinary teams that will be proposed to bring together the specialties necessary to encourage that this conduct not recur.
"And also, to go back home and to tell your pastors about the obligations we have to our children to assure that they are raised in a moral environment and a safe and secure environment."
GOAL SEVEN: Cut drug and alcohol addiction in half by the year 2010.
"The cost to Oklahomans, today, in drug and alcohol abuse is $7.6 billion."
Almost twice what that budget is $7.6 billion.
Thirteen percent of the entire gross product.
"Drug and alcohol abuse leads to crime, stifles productivity, burdens the health care system, kills almost half of all who die on our roads, it is a primary factor in divorce, out-of-wedlock births, child and domestic abuse, almost all other social problems."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen of good will, Oklahoma’s own, to look at the recommendation of the Governor’s Task Force on Alcohol and Drug Abuse."
Lower the DUI threshold to .08.
Consolidate and strengthen existing state substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.
Consolidate and strengthen them.
Enact a tough vehicle seizure law for multiple DUI offenders.
Support the effort of the Department of Human Services to screen welfare clients with substance abuse and require treatment if benefits are to continue.
None of these are easy issues and none of these solutions are easy either.
"But, it is important for us to set aside partisan differences, religious differences, geographic differences to address the things that we know in our hearts must be addressed to make us a better society."
"Let me conclude with some notes about this budget, which as I noted is in balance."
"In spite of what many of us have read, this budget is 4% larger in terms of revenue than last year."
Four percent this year than last year over revenue growth.
"As a result of a diversified economy, even with difficulty we are experiencing in the farm belt and the oil patch, we have 4% more revenue."
We made commitments though and those commitments are costing a lot of money.
They were the right things to do to dramatically improve the salaries of state employees so that we can keep the best and the brightest in our State’s service.
"To fund a road program to see to it that the infrastructure is finished and finally, competitive with the states around us."
"To provide vital relief to the oil industry, a significant part of our industrial base and certainly, a significant part of our heritage."
This is not inexpensive to provide relief to the oil industry.
We accept as an administration the need for across the board cuts.
"But, as your committees work through the budget, I would ask you to answer three questions."
"As you look at every operation of government, first, is it necessary."
Is what we are doing necessary?
"Does it contribute significantly to the betterment of the economic development of the State of Oklahoma.If it is, move on.If it is not, repeal it."
"Secondly, if it is necessary, can the private sector do it better, more efficiently, and at less cost?"
"If the answer is yes, privatize."
We had a very great experience with University Hospital and with the new investment with private prisons.
I think it is rather remarkable that we have enough private prisons in Oklahoma.
They are competing with each other and they are driving costs down.
That is exactly what the private sector is supposed to do.
"Thirdly, if we think it is a necessary business to be in and the State should be in it, look at administrative overhead."
"Determine if there are any areas within that budget, within that process that can be reduced."
"If the answer is yes, reduce it.Examples, Children First."
We will propose additional funding for Children First is an example of preparing youngsters and their mothers for life.
To partner expectant mothers with nurses to provide advice on prenatal care is the right thing to do.
It has been enormously successful.
Every single effort that we have examined with respect to Children First has been positive.
"Here is one evaluation completed by one Oklahoma mother, a proud graduate of Children First."
"“Without my nurse, God only knows what kind of mom I would be."
"At the end, she drew a happy face."
"Example, we have three DHS facilities with 416 patients and 1,400 employees."
It makes no sense to use state employment for the purpose of employing people.
State employment should be used for the purpose of satisfying vital state needs.
"If these figures can be right sized, they must be right sized."
"Example, the percentage of public school staff members who actually teach in the classroom has declined each year since 1989."
"It is now less than 50%, one of the lowest in the nation."
Education Week recently said that Oklahoma ranked 35th in the nation.
We are 28th in population and 44th income.
Thirty-fifth in the nation for pupil expenditure.
"A significant contribution, yet, 44th in teacher salaries.What does that suggest?"
A lot of money is going in and a lot of money is not making it to technology.
A lot of money is not making it to the classroom.
That money is going to administrative overhead.
"Example, state lodges and state-owned golf courses."
All of us like lodges and all of us like golf courses.
The state lodges and the state golf courses are losing $3 million a year.
We are subsidizing golf courses and lodges.
We are subsidizing a service that the public is either unwilling to pay for or does not want it.Does that make sense?
This budget proposal suggests that we should sell the lodges and sell the golf courses.
Let private sector operators run them and manage them and operate them and provide a more efficient opportunity for a better service for all Oklahomans.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the goals that we have set are ambitious goals."
"To raise Oklahoma’s income level, to improve learning for all of our people, to confront those social problems that hold us down and hold us back, we need to address these things."
Let me speak to you as individual elected officials.
I was elected by all of the people of Oklahoma to serve them.
You were elected collectively by all of the people of Oklahoma to serve them as well.
There is middle ground there somewhere and we have to find it.
"In a spirit of trust, good will and bipartisanship.We are all term limited."
Some of us by law and some of us by action of the folks.We are all term limited.What does that mean?
"When this is all over, we need to be able to look back as we look back over the course of the last four years and say together we raised the bar."
"We made our schools better, not just with money, but with standards and accountability and assessments."
We made our State a more prosperous society.
We learned from the states around us.
We learned from the countries of the world of how best to make a prosperous society.
"When the Prime Minister of Ireland told me last fall the two reasons his country, the same size as Oklahoma, had now become the most prosperous, income generating country in Europe."
"Were two, we cut taxes and raised the bar in education."
Our technical schools are four year colleges.
We made sure that when anybody looked at our country that they knew that we had here the best educated workforce in Europe.
There is simply no reason that we can not do that together.
To recognize the fact that all of this will be over soon.We need a legacy.Legacy is the “New” Oklahoma.
The legacy is to turn our back on everything that holds us back and holds us down.
"The legacy is to assure that our children and their children’s children remain in our State, our wonderful State, because they want to be here and they can be here and they are not going to be forced out by economic circumstances to go someplace else, particularly those people of the South.We can not have it."
Let us work together as an Oklahoma family.
Let us build together as an Oklahoma family.
"And, together, Democrats and Republicans alike, celebrate the “New” Oklahoma.Thank you very much."
