Ladies and gentlemen, with this budget, Pennsylvania sprints ahead.
It's $37 billion worth of new ideas, new approaches and new ways of doing business.
From our strategy to make Pennsylvania a leader in e-commerce - to our plan to redesign our 20th century economic development tools for the 21st century.
From our Growing Greener initiative - a new way of looking at how government protects our environment - to our proposal to check the growth of landfills.
From our School District Empowerment Act - to our plan to empower parents.
These are the next steps in building a New Pennsylvania.
And with this budget, we take them.
We start with the largest tax cut ever proposed by a Pennsylvania governor -- $273 million worth.
$273 million worth of tax cuts that will benefit manufacturers, small businesses, technology companies, low income working families and the middle class.
Stop for a moment to think how far we've come.
We've changed the debate on taxes in Pennsylvania.
Before, it was: should we cut them.
Now, it's: which ones and how much.
Yet we must make another basic change to this debate.
Consider the magnitude of the opportunity before us.
We've increased our Rainy Day Fund more than ten fold and cut the growth of government spending in half.
As a result, for the first time in modern Pennsylvania history, a re-elected Pennsylvania governor starts his second term asking for a tax cut -- not a tax increase.
Tax increases are not inevitable.
We must reject the thinking that says they are.
Our objective must be nothing less than never again to raise taxes -- except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
It's time to pass a constitutional amendment.
One that requires a supermajority to raise the general fund taxes.
It should be harder to raise taxes.
I guarantee this: If you put it on the ballot, the people of Pennsylvania will pass it overwhelmingly!
In our first four years, we have saved Pennsylvanians more than $3.6 billion in taxes!
$3.6 billion!
And this year, they will save even more.
We begin with an $82 million tax cut that will benefit 2 million Pennsylvania families.
These families heat their homes with natural gas.
Most families do.
With your help, we've already cut their electric bills.
With your help, we'll cut their natural gas bills, too.
Let's eliminate the state tax on natural gas.
It's a bad tax.
The harsher the winter, the more people pay.
Eliminating it will mean real savings for our families.
Take Leo Bartel, a 77 year old retired police officer who lives in Harrisburg.
Mr. Bartel uses natural gas to cook and to heat his home.
If we eliminate this tax - he will save more than $60 a year.
That's great news for Mr. Bartel - and great news for us.
Because there's a bonus to this tax cut.
It paves the way for legislation that will create natural gas competition - which can save our families even more money.
Eliminate this tax on Pennsylvania's families.
Let's follow our nationally regarded work on electric competition.
Make Pennsylvania the first state in the nation to bring competition and choice to both.
We also should build on the work we began two years ago - and expand our Working Family Tax Cut.
With this program, we've already helped more than a million hard-working families.
With this tax cut - we'll help thousands more.
A family of four making $26,000 or less will pay zero state income tax.
Zero.
That's $728 that will stay in their pockets to spend on their priorities -- not Harrisburg's.
But what all Pennsylvania families need most - is the opportunity for a good-paying, family-sustaining job.
You don't worry about paying one of the lowest personal income taxes in the country - if you don't have an income.
That's why this budget must include tax cuts that will help us keep the jobs we have and create new and better ones.
We start with the worst job-crushing tax Pennsylvania levies - the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.
The very rationale behind this tax is flawed: if your company exists - you pay.
Did you make a profit?
Doesn't matter.
You pay.
A lot.
Last year we cut it a little.
This year, we cut it a lot.
First, we lend a helping hand to the backbone of Pennsylvania's economy - our small businesses.
We slash their minimum tax by 1/3rd -- giving 150,000 small employers some of their money back.
We also cut $100 million from the Capital Stock Tax across the board - reducing the tax by one full point - to help all employers create more jobs.
And we also need to do more for our workers in manufacturing.
We make stuff in Pennsylvania.
And we make it well.
Manufacturing is still a critical sector in our economy.
More than 900,000 Pennsylvanians still depend on manufacturing jobs to put bread on the table.
These are good jobs, jobs that pay a good wage.
We've worked hard to preserve them.
Now we need to work hard to increase them.
I propose a change in the corporate income tax, to reward employers who put their manufacturing jobs here, in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania's manufacturers helped ignite the industrial revolution.
Now, the world is in the midst of a new revolution - a revolution where ideas, innovations and a skilled workforce are the new currencies of growth.
100 years ago, Pennsylvania coal fueled the industrial revolution.
This time, our technology can provide the fire.
But our tech community needs help to make it happen.
For starters, we need to expand the net operating loss deduction.
It's critical to young tech firms.
A small software company in Pittsburgh named Janus, illustrates the point.
Their first years were tough and unprofitable.
Most are for tech start-ups.
Company founder Larry Shoup could have called it quits.
But he pushed forward - with the help of the NOL.
Now, Janus plans to have 65 employees by the end of the year.
I urge you to expand this incentive - so more tech firms like Janus can call Pennsylvania home.
But technology leadership requires more than tax cuts.
To be a global competitor, we must change our 20th century economic development tools to create 21st century jobs.
In this budget, we do.
We create a Technology Investment Authority for Pennsylvania.
Its mission: to provide custom-made financing tools for high-tech firms.
Tools we need now.
That's the message biotech firm Centocor delivered to us last spring when we offered them a conventional business loan and they said - no thanks.
They said our loan - which helps build bricks and mortar -- wasn't a practical tool for a biotech company.
Like most tech companies - their most important assets are the ideas and minds of their workers.
"CEO David Holveck told us: ""ideas create jobs, buildings don't."
Now with the Pennsylvania Technology Investment Authority - companies like Centocor will have the flexibility to design financing packages to meet their needs!
And we won't stop there, either.
We have the opportunity to position Pennsylvania as a leader in electronic commerce.
We must seize it.
We will send you cutting-edge legislation to change our 20th century laws to catch up with this 21st century way of doing business.
Right now, a contract is binding only if signed in ink.
In Pennsylvania, most electronic transactions are null and void - until paper is mailed.
Let's change the rules to lead the pack - so that Pennsylvania will gain a competitive edge in electronic transactions.
It's estimated that in 5 years, e-commerce will be a $1.3 trillion market.
Pennsylvania should be at the center of it.
Even state government will take advantage of the e-commerce boom.
Last week we signed a contract with a Pennsylvania firm called Free Markets Online.
We will become the first state to buy supplies using this type of on-line auction.
We expect taxpayers to save millions as a result.
That's the power of e-commerce.
These technology initiatives represent a new way of thinking, working and succeeding in the new economy.
That economy will belong to our children.
We must help them prepare for it.
And with this budget, we do.
We begin at the very beginning - even before our children go to school -- with a new approach to preschool learning called CyberStart.
We will partner with parents, day care centers and educators to link 4,000 child care centers to the Internet - to harness its educational power for preschoolers.
And yes, we will extend our Link to Learn program for another year - and invest $20 million to keep kids in grades K-12 looking toward the future.
In our effort to make technology education a priority after high school - we introduce our SciTech Scholars Program.
It provides up to $9,000 for Pennsylvania students studying technology at Pennsylvania colleges and universities.
In return, they agree to work in Pennsylvania for up to 3 years after they graduate.
SciTech Scholars is Pennsylvania's first direct attempt to reverse the migration of our college graduates to other states.
But good technology jobs don't always require a four-year degree.
And so we introduce our GI Bill for the New Economy.
It will help those Pennsylvanians who don't seek a four year education -- but do want more education -- to succeed in our technology based economy.
But our emphasis on bits and bytes must be built on a strong foundation of ABCs.
This budget concentrates on the basics.
We will invest $5.8 billion in Pennsylvania's public schools.
Our school districts will see nearly a quarter billion dollar increase in the funds available to them.
We'll increase performance funding for our schools by 25 percent - nearly $17 million in bonuses to improve performance and attendance.
We'll increase funding for special education by nearly $34 million, or 5 percent -- to take better care of the children who need it most.
And we'll enact Read to Succeed -- a bold new program based on a simple idea: reading is the fundamental building block of all learning.
In the first 3 years, you learn to read.
Thereafter, you read to learn.
All Pennsylvania children must read to succeed.
This year, Pennsylvanians will spend $14 billion on public education.
Our per pupil spending is more than $1,200 above the national average, and ranks higher than 43 other states.
Pennsylvania taxpayers make an extraordinary commitment to our public schools.
But if our students are to excel in the 21st century - if that is truly our goal - then more money alone will not be enough.
We will need to be more vigilant in our pursuit of excellence - wherever we can find it.
And our allegiance must be to our children and their education - not the system that serves them.
Allegiance to our children requires us to be willing to cast aside state control and mandates.
When elected school district leaders embrace new and creative ways to provide public education - and when they're willing to be held accountable for the results - then the state should just get out of the way.
And so I ask you to pass the School District Empowerment Act.
Free entire school districts from the tentacles of state control - just as charter schools are today.
Allegiance to our children requires that we no longer sit idly by while a school district steadfastly fails to educate its children.
Tragically, there are a few districts in our Commonwealth where this failure is both chronic and pervasive.
In these districts, I believe we need the authority to declare academic bankruptcy - to give communities a new set of tools.
Not tools to tinker around the edges - but powerful new tools to enable communities, parents and teachers to make dramatic change.
I ask you to pass Academic Bankruptcy Legislation - before another class of our young people is squandered.
And finally, allegiance to our children requires that we support the right of every Pennsylvania parent to choose the school of their choice - even when that choice lies outside the public school system.
So while we will spend $5.8 billion in state support for public schools - this budget contains $63 million for Education Opportunity Grants.
We owe it to Pennsylvania parents - parents who work hard and pay taxes.
They deserve our support.
And students studying for their college degree deserve our support as well.
With this budget, we provide more funding for higher education - with an increase of nearly $70 million.
We will also make money for higher education available directly to our students.
This budget includes a 5% increase for our successful higher education school choice program -- PHEAA.
Outside the classroom, our most important educational asset is the community library.
I propose the most dramatic new investment ever in Pennsylvania's public libraries - a $17 million increase in direct aid.
Historically, we've been in the top ten for state support of public libraries.
Over the last four years alone - it's grown by 58%.
But local support has not kept pace.
This new state investment is designed to increase local support.
The result?
Additional hours.
Bigger collections.
Better service.
All Pennsylvanians will benefit.
They'll also benefit from our work to make our neighborhoods, streets and schools safer.
Let's build upon our historic commitment to victims of crime.
We will invest nearly $4 million to implement a Bill of Rights for victims of juvenile offenders so their voices can be heard.
With your help, they will be heard.
This budget also doubles our commitment to special juvenile probation services, including school-based probation.
These services provide our young people with intensive, hands-on, attention -- when they first get into trouble -- to prevent them from becoming serious criminals later.
And we enhance our leadership in juvenile crime prevention with a $19 million investment in programs that work to prevent crime at its roots.
One of the basic goals of our crime prevention strategy is to instill in our young people a sense of personal accountability, personal responsibility.
Those same values are at the heart of Pennsylvania's welfare reform.
One of the reasons the old welfare system did not work was the absence of consequences for those who did not follow the rules.
Now there are consequences.
Beginning March 3rd, people on welfare for two years will be required to work at least 20 hours a week.
Those who can work, but refuse to -- will no longer receive a welfare check.
Pennsylvanians must work to pay for those benefits.
It's only right that Pennsylvanians on welfare work to receive them.
Yet we will extend our compassion and generosity to those who try to help themselves.
With this budget, we invest another $81 million to support their effort.
We start by increasing child-care funding for welfare recipients and low-income working families by more than $32 million.
That means, in total - more than $375 million this year will be set aside to take care of children while their parents are on the job.
But they need to land that job first.
So, this budget increases funding for job training and transportation for the 5th year in a row.
That totals nearly $240 million - a $240 million investment in self-sufficiency - and personal responsibility.
No group of Pennsylvanians struggle more to become self-sufficient -- than Pennsylvanians with disabilities.
With this budget, we expand on the disabilities agenda we launched 18 months ago.
We start with a nearly $35 million increase to help more Pennsylvanians get the care they need - where they want it - in their own home.
Among the beneficiaries will be Pennsylvanians with developmental disabilities and mental retardation.
And to help even more - we will provide loans so hundreds of Pennsylvanians with disabilities can realize their dream of home ownership.
And we'll help even more by providing grants to modify their homes to fit their needs.
But for many Pennsylvania working families, their greatest need is healthcare for their children.
So, we make an additional $20 million investment in Pennsylvania's Children's Health Insurance Program - that's a 133% increase!
CHIP is just one of the opportunities we'll have to make Pennsylvania healthier.
Thanks to the work of Attorney General Mike Fisher and his team, we'll soon have another.
Within the year, Pennsylvania likely will receive the first installment of the National Tobacco settlement.
This is an exciting opportunity for Pennsylvania.
We have the responsibility to design a long-term plan that makes sense when we receive the first installment.
And that still makes sense when the payments stop coming.
You will soon receive such a plan from me -- one focused on using the proceeds to improve Pennsylvania's health.
Our efforts to improve Pennsylvania's quality of life must include the protection of our environment.
I ask that you put a three-year freeze and a permanent cap on landfills in Pennsylvania.
Further, this budget offers the most sweeping change in Pennsylvania's environmental spending policy in the last 30 years.
"It will lead Pennsylvania down the path of ""Growing Greener"" in the 21st century."
Annually, our state government spends a billion dollars to protect our environment.
Changing how we spend that money will enable us to focus like never before on cleaner water, better parks, preserving open space and farmland and controlling sprawl.
"""Growing Greener"" is a new way of looking at our environment - and the role government should play in protecting it."
Ladies and gentlemen, Pennsylvania is moving in the right direction.
But we must accelerate the pace.
That's what this budget is all about.
It's not a budget for the timid - and those who long for the past.
It is a budget for the bold - and those who look to the future.
A future where I predict Pennsylvania will recapture its rightful place as America's leader.
And unlike the prediction of my pal, Punxsatawney Phil - we can make this prediction come true.
Thank you.
