Florida is an exceptional place.
As far back as the 1800’s, people were moving to Florida to make their dreams come true.
In 1851, a doctor and researcher in North Florida received a patent for a refrigeration invention he developed after experimenting with ways to cool a room to make his patients more comfortable.

In 1878, Henry Flagler moved to Florida and began dreaming big.
He saw beautiful beaches that were warm year-round and when people told him there wasn’t any way people up north would come down here, he was bold enough to build a railway to get them here and hotels for them to stay in.
We now have the vibrant cities of Miami and Palm Beach thanks to the dreams of Henry Flagler over 100 years ago.
In the middle of the Great Depression, George Jenkins, Jr. left his job at a grocery store and decided he would open up his own store.

We know it as Publix.
Of course, we all know about the dreams of Walt Disney.
He never lived in Florida, but dreamed up Disney World, which opened in 1971 and put Florida on the map to be the worldwide tourist destination we are today.
Florida has long been a place where dreams come true.
But, this is not just our past – it is our future.
We have to ask ourselves who has the next big dream for Florida?
Who are the inventors?
The builders?
The trailblazers?
We want more people to chase their dreams in Florida.
In fact, some of the people whose dreams are changing the world are here with us today.

Florida is an exceptional place.
Every one of you have dreamed big and helped make our state great.
I am now a proud grandfather, and I think a lot about how we can make Florida the place where our children’s and grandchildren’s dreams come true.
In order to be a land where dreams come true, I believe we have to out-compete the rest of the world.
There are five ways we can do that.
First: Let’s keep cutting taxes!
Floridians can spend their money better than government can.
I want to say that again: Floridians can spend their money better than government can.
I have recommended cutting the tax on cell phones and TVs for every Florida family so they can save around $43 a year for spending as little as $100 a month on cell phone and TV bills combined.
I have also recommended that we permanently end the tax on manufacturing equipment so more companies will make major capital investments in Florida.
Businesses can spend their money and create jobs better than government can.
I have recommended that we get rid of the state sales tax on college textbooks because getting a higher education degree must become more affordable.
Students can spend their money better than government can.
It should not require a federal loan and decades of debt for students to get a college degree.
Price limits access – plain and simple.
If we are going to out-compete the world, the second thing we must do is make higher education more affordable.
I want to work with you this year to pass a college affordability bill that will hold the line on graduate school tuition and bring transparency to university costs.
Just like any business, we should expect education to become more affordable each year, not more expensive.
Let us never again say that, “we have to raise tuition because tuition in other states is higher than ours.
We don’t raise taxes when other states have taxes higher than ours, and we shouldn’t raise tuition when other states have higher tuition.
Third, to out-compete the world, we must invest in workforce development.
Our recommended investments this year include: $30 million for high-skill workforce training; $20 million for advanced workforce training at our tech centers; $5 million to incentivize $10,000 STEM degrees at our state colleges; and $1 million to create a paid summer program for STEM teachers.
Fourth, if we are going to out-compete the world, we must invest in K-12 education.
This year, we are recommending an increase in K-12 funding to $50 above the historic level to $7,176 per student.
Four years ago, I stood before you and said we would have to make some hard decisions.
And, we did.
We made reductions that dipped into education, knowing that when the economy improved we could invest again.
Many of these decisions were unpopular, but by living within our means it created an environment for success.
Few thought we could add 728,000 jobs, have the highest funding for education, and invest in our environment just four years later.
But, we did it together – and we have more work to do.
Now that our economy is thriving, it is time to make major investments in education.
Let’s not squander our budget surplus on special interests.
Our budget should reflect the principles we campaigned on or in other words, we should do exactly what we told voters we would do.
The final thing we must do to out-compete the world is keep Florida beautiful.
Florida is an exceptional place – we have the economy and the opportunity to keep it that way.
Our recommended budget includes more than $3 billion for environmental and agriculture programs which includes a total of $150 million in funding to protect the Everglades and another $150 million that will help protect land for the Florida panther.
It is important to point out that our recommended environmental investments in land and water programs will be $82 million above what is required by Amendment One.
The goals I just outlined to out-compete the world are bold.
I have met with many of you over the last few months and I know we share the exact same vision.
We want Florida to be the best place in the world for our children and grandchildren to live their dreams.
We agree on more than we disagree on.
We want to give families back more of the money they earn, and reduce the burden of government.
In the weeks ahead, I expect some people will try to divide us.
They will try to distract us.
But, Mr. President, Mr. Speaker – I believe we can come together with our shared desire to improve this great state.
Many of our shared goals are already outlined in your “Work Plan 2015.
Members of the Senate, Members of the House – I commit to all of you that I will be a tireless partner in your fight to make Florida the best place in the world for all of our children and grandchildren to get a great job and live their dreams.
I believe that our rich history is only a glimpse of what we can do in the future.
Everything is possible in Florida.
We are now in the lead; and it’s ours to lose.
We have to avoid any temptation to stand down or rest on our laurels.
And of course, even with our tremendous progress, there are still some Floridians who have not yet found their opportunity.
Having grown up in a family that was at times down on our luck, I know the importance of each and every family having an opportunity.
Remembering those tough times drives me every day to do all I can to give each and every one of our citizens the chance to realize their dreams.
Government cannot guarantee outcomes for everyone, but we should all be united in our desire to guarantee opportunities for everyone who is willing to work hard.
I am looking forward to working side-by-side with you during session to achieve our shared goals, inspire future generations to dream, and keep Florida working.
God bless America and God bless the exceptional state of Florida.
Thank You.
