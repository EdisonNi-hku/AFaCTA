Good evening, fellow Hoosiers, colleagues and friends.
Speaker Gregg, Senator Garton, Representative Mannweiler, Senator Young, Chief Justice Shepard and Judge Sharpnack, leaders all, thank you for hosting me in this joint session.
To former governors Bob Orr and Ed Whitcomb, thank you for being with us.
And a special thanks to our Lieutenant Governor, my friend Joe Kernan.
Joe, in this year when the state added jobs in the business sector, but our farmers took some tough hits, your leadership has been invaluable.
Once again, we come together at a remarkable time, of opportunity and prosperity.
Economists are predicting that, when the numbers are all in, Hoosiers' personal income will have grown by over $6.5 billion last year -- a 5 % increase.
For a family, that could mean a larger nest egg, a new computer, a donation to local charity, even the downpayment on a new home.
More choices -- and a real improvement in quality of life.
The number of people working in our state -- a record three million -- tells a great story of economic renewal.
But it isn't the whole story.
Many in steel and agriculture are facing hard times.
Plant closings continue to darken the lives of thousands of Hoosiers -- people struggling to keep up, while the economy passes them by.
Even so, our state is blessed with abundance -- and with choices.
At the end of this fiscal year, we'll have a record surplus of $2.1 billion.
Over the next few months, the people are counting on us to handle this growth prudently, with an eye to the future.
Now, recent national events have caused some to doubt representative democracy.
But much of the work we do in this Hoosier Capitol could restore their faith.
Time after time, I’ve seen us get past our differences to do the people’s business -- and do it well.
Because whatever divides us -- be it geography, party or ideology -- is never as strong as what unites us, as Hoosiers: A shared belief in family, faith and community.
Our conviction that opportunity and responsibility go hand in hand.
And our knowledge that we can overcome even our biggest problems by working together.
“Together.
That’s a very powerful word, and a powerful concept.
As the Governor and the Legislature, we can shape Indiana's future.
Together, we have that power.
Tonight, I am calling on you to use it -- on behalf of our first generation of the new millennium.
Sixteen years into the 21st Century, our state will hit a milestone of its own: Indiana’s two hundredth birthday.
Already, we've touched the lives of the high school graduating class of 2016.
Like Chase Price of Indianapolis and Kennedy Ball of Fort Wayne.
They will be coming of age during our Hoosier bicentennial.
They were “Building Bright Beginnings” babies, born last year.
We’re lucky to have the Price and Ball families with us tonight, including little Kennedy and Chase.
Will they all please stand?
Their parents received detailed information, based on new research, about how to help their children learn and grow -- actually expand their brains' capacity.
We reached nearly every baby born here last year, and gave out 107,000 “Bright Beginnings” packets throughout Indiana.
When parents use the information, they're getting the class of 2016 off to a running start.
And I mean that literally -- as the packet explains, certain kinds of play can actually improve a child's motor skills.
My legislative agenda builds on that running start.
"Educator Neil Postman has written that ""children are the message we send to a time we will not see."
Together, we can send a powerful message to Indiana's third century.
From a position of strength, we can -- and must -- ask ourselves: What will make Indiana the best place on earth for the high school class of 2016 to live, work, and raise a family?
And what are we doing -- every day -- to help realize that vision?
I believe we start with policies based on common sense Hoosier values, like responsibility and accountability: Keep your house in order.
Don't spend more than you take in.
Taxpayers' money is a precious resource -- and the people should keep as much as possible.
And when times are good, be sure to prepare for a rainy day.
I've talked a lot in recent weeks about budgets, tax cuts and tax reform.
Let me be clear again now: For me to sign a biennial budget, it must contain a substantial tax cut, avoid deficit spending, and leave us with a responsible reserve of at least $1.1 billion.
Keep in mind that my tax cut plan comes from you -- and your representatives on the Citizens' Commission on Taxes.
Our Commission has spent the past two years looking at the current tax system from just about every angle.
It has come up with some excellent recommendations, four of which I'll focus on tonight.
My tax cut plan will bring Hoosiers real and permanent relief from an unfair property tax burden.
First, we will take most county welfare costs off the property tax rolls.
Second, we will cut, as deeply as possible, a substantial portion of the property tax on business inventories.
This will make Indiana businesses more competitive with neighboring states.
Third, we will place a tighter lid on local property tax increases.
And finally, we will fortify those property tax cuts with another cut that benefits every household -- a permanent, 50 % increase in the personal income tax exemption, from $1,000 to $1,500 a year.
Taken together, these new cuts will bring more than $1 billion in real tax relief to Hoosiers over the next four years.
These are tax cutting opportunities we can responsibly afford.
They're also opportunities we can't responsibly afford to miss.
With our fiscal house in order -- meaning a balanced budget, sound reserve and real tax cuts -- we're ready to invest where we can earn our greatest return: In Kennedy Ball and Chase Price's potential.
With “Building Bright Beginnings,” we’ve started early.
The class of 2016 will be among the first to benefit from new scientific research, but it won't be the last.
Recent findings about how -- and how early -- the brain develops are adding new urgency to education and family policy: How can we encourage parents and others to spend time with Chase and Kennedy, reading to them, doing the things that can actually make them smarter?
How can we provide them high quality childcare if their parents work outside the home?
How can we make sure Kennedy and Chase are ready to learn when they start school?
How can we catch and correct any reading problems early?
How can we ensure all students a safe and secure school?
And how can we guarantee excellent public education?
My legislative agenda is grounded in answers to these questions.
First, we need to encourage local early childhood activities with matching grants.
I'm also particularly excited about our plans for an Institute for Early Childhood Development.
Affiliated with an Indiana college or university, the Institute will put our state at the heart of national efforts to translate advanced research into policy and practice.
In addition, with so many working parents in our state, high quality, affordable childcare is a must.
To help ease the current shortage, I'm proposing new investments in both better physical facilities and better trained providers.
By the year 2003, when Chase and Kennedy turn five, the full-day kindergarten program I commend to you tonight could be available all over Indiana.
Although we've made it optional for school corporations, the benefits of full-day kindergarten are so great that I hope every community takes advantage of this opportunity.
From music to computer skills, the full-day curriculum exposes developing minds to areas of life-long interest.
Evansville's full day kindergarten has been making a difference for 10 years.
Participants achieve higher test scores into seventh and eighth grade.
With us here tonight are outstanding kindergarten teachers from around the state.
They're ready to get full-day kindergarten up and running.
Let's not disappoint them -- or their future students.
I want to sign full-day kindergarten into law this session.
Now, elementary school will always pose special challenges for some students, even when they're well prepared.
What happens to children who need extra help learning to read?
Unfortunately, we know what happens to those who don't get help.
Right now, nearly one third of all 3rd graders can't pass the ISTEP plus reading test.
That's an appalling statistic.
And a poor reader at age eight is more likely to drop out by 16.
Tonight, I ask your support for a comprehensive, statewide reading assessment to find, and assist, those 2nd graders who need more help.
Next, I ask your support for a statewide school safety effort to get communities, parents and law enforcement working together.
We want to make sure every school corporation has a plan and an action team working to keep schools safe and secure.
In Howard County, for example, they've developed a computerized security tracking system that works.
It allows juvenile courts, law enforcement and the schools to track, and head off, potential problems.
Security planning allows teachers and students to do their jobs, and, where necessary, the police to do theirs.
Let's make sure Kennedy and Chase are able to attend schools free of drugs and violence.
As we strive for greater achievement, we need to remember that some great things are already going on in Indiana’s public schools.
I've seen them myself, in visits all over the state.
In Crawfordsville, sixth graders who do all their work on laptop computers were quite a sight to behold.
Up in LaPorte, I was fascinated by the way they've integrated their early childhood and kindergarten programs.
And I was inspired by School 46 in Indianapolis.
Aided by a long-term partnership with Kroger's and strong parental involvement, Principal Phyllis Imel has helped transform this once-failing school into an award-winning, national model.
What makes a school a good place to learn?
There are as many answers as there are good schools, but underneath them all is the concept of accountability.
Tonight, I ask your support for a strong, fair system to hold schools accountable for their progress toward academic excellence.
For this system to work, the public first needs more information about how our schools are doing -- on a school-by-school basis.
"I propose expanding our ""School Report Cards."
People should know, for example, how students are doing in specific subjects.
How many computers are used in daily instruction, and how extensively?
To what degree are parents active in school affairs?
To what extent are the community and businesses involved?
How many students have to do remedial work?
And here's an important one: How many students start and finish the academic year in the same school?
After all, you can't hold a school accountable for a student who's no longer there.
Every school will have to supply this information, and more.
And thanks to the news media, we'll all know how schools are measuring up.
The next step is holding them accountable for their progress.
Schools that aren’t achieving agreed-upon goals, and aren’t improving, will have to seek outside help.
Parents, teachers, and community and business leaders, under the direction of the local school board, will all work with a troubled school.
And if that doesn’t get results, a team of education experts, the best in the state, will help the local community decide whether, and how, to make more fundamental changes in the school -- for the sake of the students.
That's what accountability is all about: responsibility for meeting goals, rewards if you do, and consequences if you don't.
School quality won’t improve without it.
Full-day kindergarten, reading by 3rd grade, school security, and expanded school report cards and accountability.
All necessary investments to ensure that the first generation of the new millennium is the best educated in Hoosier history.
With strong support for higher education, we're also working to create high-wage jobs for those graduates.
For example, our new 21st Century Growth Fund is designed to spur investment in biomedical research and other business sectors with high-wage growth potential.
A final thought on how children learn best: Nothing we do in government could ever take the place of parents and family, nor should it.
A recent national survey ranked Indiana number one in increased parental involvement in schools.
I was delighted to see that.
Education may be a partnership among school, family, community and child, but a strong family is the necessary link that forms the chain.
There is no substitute for it, and we must do everything we can to foster it.
Let me just touch briefly on other work we have before us this session.
Continued support for the 500 new police we've put on the streets over the past two years, and a new strike force fund for high crime areas.
The Governor's Council on Impaired and Dangerous Driving recommends lowering the legal blood alcohol level to 0.08.
The Commission for a Drug Free Indiana has also come out for curbs on tobacco vending machines and the investment of tobacco settlement funds, thanks to the work of our Attorney General, Jeff Modisett.
These are worthy public health and safety measures and need to be enacted this session.
We'll be working to extend the CHOICE program and other care options for the elderly, and for people with disabilities.
We need to expand health insurance coverage for children whose parents couldn't afford it otherwise, building on a base of 42,000 youngsters enrolled last year.
We need to pass our open access statute, making it easier for the public to access government records.
We must keep our insurance and banking industries competitive.
Continue our support for Hoosier businesses, and our working men and women.
Protect our natural resources.
Make sure we continue to meet clean air and water standards.
And let's not forget clean politics: We must continue our efforts to reform campaign finance.
In closing, let me talk for a moment about how we're translating Hoosier values into action as the new millennium approaches.
A year ago, I convened the statewide Millennium Task Force.
This group was asked to lead Indiana into the new millennium in creative ways, by focusing on strengthening communities.
My wife Judy and members of the Task Force have visited 64 of the more than 100 communities that have convened local millennium committees.
These groups are taking stock of their past and present, and creating a vision for their future.
Already, these communities are taking action to make their goals a reality.
In this session, we can do the same for our state.
Keep our fiscal house in order.
Cut taxes responsibly.
And invest in early childhood development and excellent schools.
With this legislative agenda, we'll make great strides toward our ultimate goal: Making sure Indiana is the best place on earth for Chase Price, Kennedy Ball and the first generation of the new millennium to live, work and raise a family.
I know we can do it, together.
Thank you.
