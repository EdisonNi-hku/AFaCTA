Madame President, Madame Speaker, Senator Sullivan, distinguished members of the General Assembly, friends and guests.
Today we stand together as colleagues, as part of Connecticut’s proud history of leadership, and as representatives of the people…in this great citizens’ democracy.
Since the opening of the very first session of the Connecticut General Assembly, our elected leaders have worked with a single focus…to make this state and this nation a better place.

September 11th brought us a new world.
We didn’t choose it.
But I’ll tell you one thing…we will define it.

These proposed laws will cover a number of areas: They will protect our public water supplies.
We will include terrorism under state racketeering laws.
And, we will create tougher penalties for the possession of weapons of mass destruction.
September 11th changed the way we must address threats to our freedoms.
Police and prosecutors need new laws to meet those threats.
And we will do whatever it takes to give law enforcement the tools they need to protect our way of life!

Jobs have been lost in the current recession, but make no mistake: our state government will be there to help anyone who has lost a job get back into the workforce.
This year’s budget process will require us to revisit past commitments that we have all agreed upon.
But we can all agree that this is not the time to withdraw our commitment to the unemployed.
Just as our national security was tested by an act of war, Connecticut’s economic security is being tested by the effects of a national slowdown.
We can debate when that slowdown will reverse itself and we can debate how deep our problems are, but there is no debate that the main mission of this legislative session is the balancing of the state budget.
"As Speaker Lyons has said, this is not the time ""to embark on any costly new ventures."
The projections we used to forge the budget compromise of last year are no longer valid.
The state has less money than we all projected.
And we can not afford to pretend otherwise.
It is our responsibility to face that fiscal reality.
And our willingness to deal with the stark clarity of the balance sheet will determine our ability to keep Connecticut working.
The economic slowdown has impacted the tax revenues of almost every state in the nation.
In Connecticut, the projected deficit for this fiscal year is $350 million.
Next year the shortfall is $650 million.
Even though there are other places we’d like to spend.
Even though there are other investments we’d like to make, we’ve maxed out, we’ve come up short.
As Bill Dyson might say…we’ve got twelve items and we are standing in the ten items or less checkout lane.
It really is that simple.
This is not you versus me.
Democrat versus Republican.
I signed the budget that you all voted for.
But as leaders, we can not implement that spending, knowing that our fiscal fortunes have changed.
How we respond, will directly affect our future.
It will affect the bond rating we worked so hard to restore.
It will affect the ability of our economy to grow.
This slowdown comes at the tail of a remarkable period of economic growth.
A period of diversification, job growth and business expansion.
We as a state government have contributed to that expansion through conservative budgeting.
Together: We have cut the growth of government spending We have cut taxes by $2 billion We have produced seven consecutive budget surpluses and we have filled the Rainy Day Fund Among the 50 states, Connecticut is in excellent position to weather the storm because for the last seven years we have worked together to build a responsive yet responsible government.
Though we have cut taxes we have never put Connecticut’s budget at risk.
We have invested millions of dollars in programs to improve our schools, made our neighborhoods safe and protected our environment.
But those investments have always been tempered by the constitutional cap on spending.
In these more difficult times we are no less responsive to those who need government assistance.
We are no less willing to invest in Connecticut’s future.
There is no retreat in this budget.
We are not retreating on transportation, education, or human services.
Investing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in transportation is not a retreat.
Investing over a billion dollars a year in education and new school construction is not a step back.
Our extraordinary commitment to urban development will not be compromised.
Caring for those in need at a cost of more than six billion dollars a year is not a withdrawal from duty.
There is no retreat.
But there must be restraint.
Responsibility requires us to live within our means.
Connecticut’s constitution requires a balanced budget.
That means when the taxpayers of Connecticut send us a dollar to meet the responsibilities of state government – we spend a dollar.
One dollar and no more.
"Long before he was president, Ronald Reagan said, ""no government program ever voluntarily reduces itself in size."
"He said a ""government bureau is the closest thing to eternal life we will ever know."
"When government is growing beyond the people’s ability to pay, it is our responsibility to say, ""stop!"""
In fact, we as the people’s representatives are the only ones who can say, stop.
Accordingly- with the state facing an unexpected budget deficit I have halted all spending of last year’s remaining surplus.
To continue spending beyond our expected revenues defies common sense.
It would never happen in any responsible Connecticut household and it shouldn’t happen in state government either.
I expect full debate over the next several months as we try to balance the budget.
My record shows that I am willing to compromise.
But a few things should also be clear.
I will not sign a budget that is in balance on paper only.
I will not sign a budget that depletes our limited Rainy Day Fund.
And I will not sign a budget that requires us to raise taxes or borrow money the day after Election Day.
"Bob Ward, the Republican leader of the House, said recently; we can not ""borrow away our future."
The people of Connecticut deserve better than that.
And I know you all agree.
Our effort to balance the budget must be fair and thoughtful.
History should be our guide.
In the late 1980s legislators faced the very circumstances we face today.
Unfortunately, they took the wrong course.
They depleted the Rainy Day Fund leaving Connecticut without a safety net.
They borrowed money for on-going expenses, putting the state in debt that took almost ten years to pay back.
They raised taxes, throwing the engines of an already slowing economy into reverse.
Those mistakes can not be repeated.
Our final budget package may be the product of compromise, but it must not compromise Connecticut’s economic future.
Together, we have made tremendous progress for this state over the past seven years.
As our economy has grown, so too has state government’s ability to care for those in need.
Spending on programs to help the poor and the sick expanded.
Education spending has grown significantly and has been targeted at early learning.
Prescription drug coverage for the elderly has expanded.
Health insurance for children has been expanded.
Funding for mental health programs has grown by 60%.
That’s not retreating from the battle.
That’s winning the war.
Millions have been invested in Connecticut municipal budgets by financing school construction and providing direct aid.
The most vulnerable children of our state -- in our Department of Children and Families -- have benefited from reforms, dramatic budget increases, new programs and facilities.
Millions more have been spent and will be spent improving our transportation system and protecting our environment.
Only the shortsighted measure success by how much more can be spent.
When resources are limited; the smart money protects what has been built and awaits the next opportunity to grow.
There is no better reason to be prudent now, than to ensure our ability to grow in the future.
And nothing impacts our ability to grow more than education.
Even as I urge this Legislature to exercise restraint, my administration is working with the University of Connecticut to build on the success of the UCONN 2000 program.
Over the last seven years we have been rebuilding UCONN’s statewide campuses brick by brick.
The main campus at Storrs has been transformed.
The health center in Farmington has expanded to include a research wing.
The school’s statewide reach has been extended with new campuses in Stamford and Waterbury.
UCONN’s role as a beacon of knowledge and learning is epitomized by the seaside campus at Avery Point.
This one billion dollar investment has paid off with higher enrollments, increasing applications from Connecticut high school students, and an educated workforce - home schooled - at our largest public university.
Since the start of UCONN 2000 freshman enrollment has increased by 56%.
Minority freshman enrollment has increased by 62%.
Three hundred and fourteen valedictorians and salutatorians have joined the student body.
And UCONN has been ranked as the number one public university in New England.
But it’s about more than buildings and landscape.
It’s about students!
We are reversing the brain drain.
We are reinforcing Connecticut’s greatest economic strength: Yankee intellect and ingenuity.
We’ve got our best chance ever to keep Connecticut’s best and brightest just where we want them – right here in Connecticut – and we are going to run with it.
We can not rest when this rebuilding program ends in the next few years.
"Today I am announcing that work has begun on the second phase of UCONN 2000 to be known as ""21st Century UCONN."
A second ten year schedule of rebuilding and revitalization that will complete the task of making the University of Connecticut one of the most modern and exciting public universities in the country.
Twenty-first century UCONN – it’s a fitting title for the future we must begin building today.
We are also moving forward with our plans to extend the rebuilding efforts at the Connecticut State University campuses and our community colleges by five years.
We want every Connecticut college student to be the best they can possibly be.
Connecticut’s commitment to education doesn’t end when the slogan runs its course.
Our commitment to education is permanent and long lasting.
We are at a unique moment in our history.
The land of Steady Habits is safe and secure.
We continue to thrive, prosper, and grow – determined to improve our quality of life.
We lead the nation in open space preservation.
We lead the nation in state funding to the arts.
Together, we have made life better for our citizens.
Connecticut is a much-envied state.
We are a leader in education.
A leader of the knowledge-based world economy.
A leader in cutting edge technologies, life-saving science and research.
We have an historical obligation to represent the people.
Our citizens want a safe Connecticut, a strong secure future for their children, and economic security.
"Over the past seven years, the men and women in this chamber have worked in the spirit of the ""Connecticut Compromise."
I am tremendously proud of all we have accomplished together.
I am tremendously proud of the civility that has guided our public debate.
With few exceptions, the public good has prevailed over the temptations of empty partisanship.
Together we have favored the politics of results.
Protecting our core values and protecting our economic foundation.
Whatever the challenge we can keep Connecticut working when we work together.
The people expect no less of us, especially in the wake of September’s national tragedy.
There has been a new awakening since that day.
People are searching for greater depth and meaning in their lives.
More of us are reaching to repair a frayed connection with spirit and soul.
As elected officials, we are challenged to lead through the uncertainty of the rubble.
Today, I ask that we all think beyond the routine of how a bill becomes law.
I challenge you on behalf of the people you represent, to be a leader in all aspects of your public life.
To help a child.
Care for someone in need.
Stop to help someone who is struggling in life.
Lead by example.
Help capture the essence of spirit and soul in your work.
In your life.
In the life of your family and your community.
Serve in this chamber with purpose, with meaning, and with respect for each other.
By virtue of your position as public servants, at this moment in American history, you have a special responsibility.
A responsibility, and an opportunity to help your fellow citizens define the purpose of this age.
To remember and live the promise of the things we hold dear.
By doing what is right, in ways large and small, caring and kindness will emerge as the defining traits of our national character.
Thank you.
God bless you and God bless the great State of Connecticut.
