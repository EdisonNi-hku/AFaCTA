SENTENCES
"Chief Justice Kaye, honorable members of the Court of Appeals, Lieutenant Governor McCaughey Ross, Attorney General Vacco, Comptroller McCall, Majority Leader Bruno, Speaker Silver, Assemblyman Reynolds, Senator Connor, respected members of the Legislature, and distinguished guests."
"I welcome you all to this great capital city, where for over two centuries the elected representatives of our people have met to carry out the will of the citizens who sent them here."
Let me start on a personal note by welcoming the four newest members of the Legislature.
"I want to offer my sincere congratulations to Assemblymen Jim Bacalles, Marc Butler, and Cliff Croutch, and Assemblywoman Betty Little."
"May you seize this opportunity, and may you make the people proud."
I also want to congratulate Assemblyman Reynolds on his election as Assembly Republican Leader.
"Tommy, your new responsibilities are a fitting tribute to your years of hard work."
I'm sure we all wish you great success in the years to come.
And it is always a pleasure to welcome Governor Carey back to Albany.
"Governor, you have our sincere thanks for your long and faithful service to the people of New York State."
"And let me pause to recognize -- at least for me -- the two most important people in the room -- my wife, Libby, and my mother, Margaret."
It has been a spectacular year.An historic year.
A year full of accomplishments for the people.
We can be proud because we have made life better for New Yorkers.
"After all, that is our purpose."
"For the first time in over a decade, this government stands as the servant of the people, and not the other way around."
This is what New Yorkers want their government to be.And we have heard them.
"This past year, people across our state and nation saw the movie ""Apollo 13."
It's an inspiring story of three American astronauts who overcame grave dangers and incredible odds to complete a journey around the moon.
"The story began with this simple statement from the Apollo 13 commander: ""Houston, we've got a problem."
And that's when the whole team went to work.
"With courage and confidence, they were able to save the lives of those brave astronauts."
"In contrast to the ""can-do"" attitude of the Apollo 13 team, the people of New York for too long heard from their government that events were beyond their control."
State government had lost confidence.
"State government was accepting a loss of hope, a belief in lowered expectations, and a loss of opportunity for our people."
"In November of 1994, the people said: ""Albany, we've got a problem.But it isn't us.It's our government."
The people said: We have confidence and courage.
We believe that the system can work.
We know that the American dream is alive and well.The people were right.
That is how it always should be in a free and open democracy.
"And it is to the people -- to their hope, their ingenuity, their creativity and to their spirit -- that this administration is dedicated."
"Over the past year, we have set out to undo the damage done by the failed policies of the past."
"You and I, together, with the enthusiastic support of our people, created new programs to meet the people's challenges."
I'm happy to report to you today that we have met many of those challenges.
But we still have a long way to go.
We created a more efficient and more effective state government.
One more responsive to the people.
"A government that provides the services people need and deserve, and does so while living within the people's means."
You are all to be congratulated.
"Today, we have cut taxes on middle class families."
"Today, we have reduced bureaucratic waste."
"Today, we have lowered state spending for the first time in generations."
"Today, our streets and communities are safer than they have been in years."
Violent crime is down more than 13 percent.Robbery is down 19 percent.
Murders are down over 24 percent and violent crime by inmates on work release is down 89 percent.
"Two weeks ago, I told you our welfare rolls were down by about 100,000 people."
The year end numbers are now in.
Home relief caseloads are down by over 25 percent.
"And today, we have 172,000 fewer people on welfare than last January.That is truly historic change."
"And today, we have created more than 100,000 new private sector jobs for our people."
As good as this is -- and it is good -- we are only at the beginning of the great renewal of the Empire State.
The Apollo 13 astronauts didn't give up.And neither will we.
* * * * * We stand today less than four years from the year 2000.
"We face a new era full of opportunity, new adventures and new challenges."
We stand ready to meet those challenges.
There are always those who want to hold back the entrepreneurial spirit of America.
But the people of New York know better.
"We know that our ingenuity, creativity and innovation have no boundaries."
"I believe in the people, and I know you do too."
"Let us reaffirm our core belief, rooted in our earliest days as a state, that it is the people who come before government."
"The first article of our Constitution -- before anything about the powers of the Governor, the Legislature or the Judiciary -- is the Bill of Rights."
"The Bill of the people's Rights, not the government's.That is as it should be."
"The program I outline to you today will build on the great successes we achieved in one short year, and continue New York's rise to its proper place of leadership among the states."
"It is an agenda not just for this year or the next year, but for this generation and the next, and for generations to come."
Our people deserve nothing less.
We began this journey at a distinct disadvantage.
"We inherited a state government that led the nation in high taxes, pointless regulation, and a welfare system out of control."
"We inherited policies that discouraged work, downplayed individual responsibility and trampled personal freedoms."
Too many of our best and brightest people were leaving our state to find hope and opportunity elsewhere.
They were leaving because New York had a state government that too often acted without reason.Here's one example.
State regulators slapped a nursing home in Syracuse with a food safety violation.Why?
Because it permitted creamed corn to run into the meatloaf and potatoes on a resident's lunch plate.
The regulators apparently wanted corn to be served on a separate dish.I kid you not.
"Now, say what you want about creamed corn -- I happen to like it -- but it's hardly a nutritional threat if a little of your vegetable runs into the rest of your lunch.There's more."
"In the Bronx, the bureaucracy sanctioned a nursing home for a food violation."
What was the nursing home's crime?It didn't serve pork.
"In fact, it hadn't served pork for 125 years.It's a Jewish nursing home."
But the prior administration insisted that it put pork on the menu.
I could not make this stuff up.It's ridiculous.It must stop.And it will.
"* * * * * This year, we restored New York's future by replacing the old darkness with a light that comes from a people whose ideas, leadership and creativity are the best in the world."
"By promoting freedom for our people, we have freed our state."
"This year, New York's government finally changed."
We are renewing the spirit of New York.
This is what government should be about.
"Freeing our people so they can excel, and eliminating policies that only hold our people back."
"One problem is that once something becomes a policy, it never seems to change -- even when the times change and the policy no longer makes sense."
"One of those policies recently led to what we call the ""Attack of the Seven-Foot Doorway.Here's what happened."
"Mark Zaharis, a small-businessman from Ithaca, runs Pete's Liquor Store, named after his father."
"This past year, he built a new store."
One sensible policy in New York's building code says no doorway can be more than 25 percent of the width of the wall.
Mr. Zaharis met the code with a four-foot door in a 25-foot wall.
"All was fine until the State Liquor Authority came around, and told him he might not get a liquor license because the doorway failed to meet a different rule."
"That rule, dating from around Prohibition, says doorways to back rooms of bars and liquor stores had to be at least seven feet wide."
I'm told the rule was instituted so police could easily see what was going on the back room -- just in case there was illegal activity.
The businessman was stuck in a Catch-22.
"If he complies with the Building Code, he violates a Liquor Authority rule."
"If he complies with the Liquor Authority rule, he violates the building code.It's ridiculous."
"Al Capone is gone, Elliott Ness is gone, Prohibition is long gone."
But somehow this rule survived.We suspended the rule.
"Pete's is open for business, and small businesses across the state are getting the message -- we will help them grow and create jobs right here in New York."
New Yorkers have always done what was right and just.
"We are the people who dug the Erie Canal, welcomed the immigrants to Ellis Island and led insurgent Colonists to liberation from British tyranny."
"The spirit that leads our renewal today is the same one that danced in Times Square 50 years ago after freedom's victory over fascism, and celebrated when the Berlin Wall fell."
"This spirit will help New York State continue its resurgence, and its victories."
And the victories have been many.
"After decades of losing jobs, we are now a leader in creating jobs, and first in the nation in cutting taxes."
"Because we have made government work better for our people, we are now becoming the nation's leader in statistics that make us proud."
But creating jobs is not about statistics.It is about people.
Every job created in this state means another New York family can have a better quality of life.
"Every job created here means another young person can live here, build a future and raise a family here."
"And every job created in New York means more elderly New Yorkers who can stay in our state, and be near their families, their grandchildren, and their friends."
"Every job created in New York State means more stability, greater strength, and a brighter future for everyone."
The changes we made this past year -- returning government to its proper role as the servant of the people -- are working.
"In Skaneateles Falls, Welch Allyn created 50 new jobs.That's not just 50 people."
That's 50 families that have more hope today than they had a year ago.
Industrial Ceramics created 100 jobs in Livingston County.
Toshiba Display Devices is adding 100 jobs in Horseheads.
And Pratt Industries is creating 400 new jobs on Staten Island.These are real jobs.Private-sector jobs.
Jobs that hold families together and help pay for the public-sector jobs that help deliver the services the people need and deserve.
"For every job created in New York, there is a person and a family with a story."
A story about someone striving to achieve.
"Or the story of a child for whom a job creates a home that is stronger financially, and lifted by hope."
Every job created here means another opportunity for another person to lift themselves and their families to a better future.
It means the opportunity to buy a new house.
"Or for a child to take gymnastics, or play ball in the Spring."
Or for a student to buy a home computer.
Or for a teen-ager in high school to look forward to the promise of a college education.
"The last thing a job is, is a statistic."
"Above all, a job is a door that opens out to a dream."
New York State was built on these dreams.
My grandparents had those dreams.
"Last Fall, I had the opportunity to visit the towns in Hungary and Italy where my grandfathers grew up."
"In Kisvarda and Reggio Calabria, the people today still believe as Janos Pataki and Matteo Lagana believed decades ago -- that New York is the place of hope and opportunity, unique in the world.A place of dreams."
"Dreams of a better life, for ourselves, for our children, and our children's children."
"These are the same dreams shared by today's new Americans from Seoul, Salonika and Santo Domingo."
Having a job is the first step toward making those dreams come true.
"So hats off to the 1,000 people being hired by Oxford Health in Westchester."
And to the 100 new hires at ConMed in Rome and the 200 new workers at Hardinge in Elmira.This is real growth.
This is real hope and opportunity for the future.And there's more.
Ninety families are better off in Plattsburgh because of jobs at Upstate Precision.
Buckbee-Mears is creating 300 new jobs in Cortland.
"The new Victory Theater, the first of nine theaters to be renovated on 42nd Street, marks the beginning of a Renaissance that will create 49,000 jobs and is one of the largest revitalization projects in the nation."
Each one of these jobs -- each of the people who now have work -- is a success story.
And it wouldn't have happened without your support.
"Eastman Kodak, Pepsi, and GM SuperSteel in Scotia.The list goes on and on."
"In Broome County, Hadco is expanding its New York plant and creating 400 new jobs."
"Sealright Company is not only remaining in Fulton, but it is moving jobs from Kansas to New York."
This means 550 jobs for New Yorkers.
"And just yesterday, we won another fight -- this time over New Jersey and Pennsylvania."
"Continental Bakery will invest millions and expand its Wonder Bread bakery in South Jamaica, Queens -- keeping 450 jobs and creating another 100 jobs."
"This list can continue and does continue until it adds up to over 100,000 new private sector jobs."
One hundred thousand families today that are stronger.That growth is real.That hope is real.
The opportunity these jobs provide is real.
And all of it is a good start toward returning New York to its rightful position as the Empire State.But it is only a start.
"We must continue the fight, until we see these successes from Buffalo to Brooklyn, and all across this state."
Some in this town are already calling on us to return to the failed ways of the past and postpone prosperity.
Let us respond today and in the future: We will not turn our backs on the people.
We will not promise one thing in 1995 and deliver something less in 1996.
We will keep the promise to cut taxes.
And then we will cut taxes again.
Think of the taxes we cut in 1995.
"We cut the personal income tax, the corporate tax surcharge, the gross receipts tax and subchapter S taxes subject to the surcharge."
"We cut the diesel fuel tax, the aviation tax, the beer tax and the soda tax."
We cut the estate tax and the pari-mutuel tax.
"That's a long list, and you are to be congratulated."
"But we can, we must, and we will do more."
"We must keep cutting the gross receipts tax on energy, cut the Cuomo tax on real estate, cut the sales tax on clothing, and we must continue to attack the high property taxes that threaten the American dream of home ownership."
We have begun to free the people from the shackles of high taxes.
"In 1995, we gave the citizens the tax cuts they demanded, after years in which the promise of lower taxes went postponed."
"We told private enterprises large and small that our door was open, that we welcomed them, and that we would create an environment where they could grow and create jobs for our people."
"We can, we must and we will do more to reduce the burden of taxes on New Yorkers."
People have always been ready to build and grow in New York State.
"But government stood in their way.This, now, is changing.We are changing it."
* * * * * We will continue to say `yes' to jobs and opportunity by reforming workers' compensation and unemployment insurance.
"These programs were intended to bring fairness to the workplace, but today they do not fairly serve either workers or employers."
"In recent years, costs skyrocketed, and the injured worker received no better service or better medical care."
Some good changes have been made.
We have introduced managed care into workers' comp.
Employers are providing safer workplaces.
"This year, we decreased workers' comp rates by five percent."
"But we can, we must and we will do more."
"Today, I am directing Labor Commissioner John Sweeney, Workers' Compensation Board Chairman Robert Snashall, and Director of Regulatory Reform Bob King -- whose office has made great strides in restoring sanity to our regulatory process -- to submit to me within 90 days a sweeping reform plan for workers' compensation and the unemployment insurance program."
"I have directed them to reach out to business leaders and to labor leaders, so that we can fashion a plan that will help all New Yorkers."
"I look forward to working with each of you in this Chamber so that together, we can enact a true workers' compensation reform package this year."
Make no mistake -- we will ensure workplace safety.
And we will ensure that our employers have the freedom to grow and create more jobs for our people.
One hundred thousand new jobs is impressive.
"But we can, we must, we will do better."
PUBLIC PROTECTION No duty is more fundamental to government than the duty to protect the right of the people to live in safety.
"In just one year, you and I together have made our neighborhoods safer places to live and work."
We have made our communities safer places to start a family and raise a family.
Safer places to grow and prosper.
"We restored the belief that justice can and will be served in our state by reinstating the death penalty, after 18 years."
We changed the system of criminal justice so that violent criminals pay the price when they break the law.
We established Truth in Sentencing -- we increased sentences for violent felons and eliminated parole for repeat violent felons.And we signed Megan's Law.
"But we can, we must and we will do more."
"The locks and chains that honest New Yorkers, particularly our elderly, feel are needed to bar their doors and windows are a testament to the failures of the past."
"We will not rest until all New Yorkers feel safe in their neighborhoods, in their homes, and in their schools."
"The people of New York are prepared to continue taking the steps necessary to make our communities safe once again, to let New Yorkers live safely in their own communities and build their futures in confidence."
Violent criminals must be kept off the street so that decent citizens can walk safely.
"To that end, we will continue to strengthen our criminal justice laws so that, as we rise to become our nation's leader in jobs and opportunity, we also work to become the safest state in the country."
Our rise as a state has many heroes.
Perhaps none are more important than our police officers who risk their lives every day to preserve our liberty and our freedom.
Rochester Police Sergeant James Strassner is one of those heroes.
"A year ago, Sergeant Strassner responded to a bank robbery."
"This 27-year veteran chased the suspect on foot, caught him and a struggle ensued."
That's when the suspect pulled a .38 caliber handgun from his jacket and shot Sergeant Strassner.
"The suspect didn't get far, and he was arrested."
"Sergeant Strassner was left bleeding on the street, a victim of the violence he faced every day."
Sergeant Strassner's heroism didn't end there.
"He donated his $10,000 reward from the bank to a neighborhood group working to improve the lives of the people in the Clinton section of Rochester, where Sergeant Strassner was shot."
Sergeant Strassner is with us today.
"I'd like to recognize him for his heroics, and thank him on behalf of all New Yorkers."
"This year, I will submit legislation that allows police officers to do the jobs they were entrusted to do."
It is not enough for us to merely applaud the heroics of an officer such as Sergeant Strassner.
We must give our police the tools they need to protect the law-abiding citizens and arrest those who break the law.
The Police and Public Protection Act of 1996 that I will propose will ensure that evidence obtained within standards of the U. S. Constitution can and will be used in state courts to convict those who break the law.
"Two weeks ago, we unveiled a new attack on crime -- a 10-point plan that targets gang members, gun traffickers, felons who prey on children, and criminals who assault police officers."
"We fight juvenile crime, by holding violent youth to new levels of responsibility for their actions."
The criminal who shot Sergeant Strassner was a violent felon out on parole.
"Under our plan, criminals who commit one violent felony will not and cannot ever be released on parole."
Persons convicted for the second time of molesting a child will serve at least 15 years to life in jail.
Penalties will be increased for crimes involving the sale of firearms.
"And our plan further protects police officers, the guardians of the people's safety."
Someone who seriously injures a police officer while committing a crime will spend at least 20 years in prison.
"The changes we approved this year have already made our streets safer, by making sure that dangerous criminals serve time in prison for breaking the law."
"New York is safer today than it was a year ago, and you can be proud of that."
But we cannot rest and we will not rest.
We need clear laws that put criminals in jail.
We used to have a law that said you could not put drug traffickers in jail if they didn't know the exact weight of the drugs they were carrying.
"This law was absurd, and it is now gone."
"This year, I will propose closing other criminal-friendly loopholes in our laws."
"We as a government must work together to ensure that our laws protect the innocent and punish the guilty.We are a safer state.We must become safer, still."
"WELFARE As we create a safer and more prosperous Empire State, as we continue our great march into the 21st Century, we rely on the irrepressible spirit of the people of New York."
The spirit that fought and won at Saratoga and that built the towers of Manhattan.
"Today, though, the spirit of too many New Yorkers has been destroyed by welfare."
Welfare has made too many New Yorkers all too dependant on an uncaring bureaucracy.Welfare has failed.
"While many have benefitted, welfare has trapped many more in a system of counterfeit compassion that never met its purpose."
It's clear -- more welfare is not the answer; it is the problem.
The answer is to encourage incentives to work.
"This past year, we took giant steps toward replacing New York's failed welfare system with a system that encourages work.These changes are working."
"Today, 172,000 fewer people are on welfare than a year ago."
"And more than 36,000 New Yorkers are earning their benefits through workfare, by working in parks, municipal offices and public buildings.We have done well.Now, we must do more."
Welfare should not be for the bureaucrats who administer it.
It should be a helping hand for those who need it.
Rewards and incentives are the key.
And there is no reward like work.
"Across our state, workfare programs are working, and people are benefitting."
One of the most successful partnerships is New York City's Business Link program.
"Working with such companies as the GAP and Borg-Warner, Business Link placed 550 former welfare recipients in private-sector jobs in just the last seven months."
"We're changing welfare so that many more people can have jobs, their families can have hope, and together, we all have a better future."
"We can, we must and we will ensure that the benefits of work outweigh the benefits of welfare."
"EDUCATION As we face the 21st Century, our challenges grow."
So must our commitment to excellence in our schools.
"The global competition of the future demands not that we just have computers in the classrooms, but that we have children capable of using computers in the classroom, and teachers able to help children meet the new technological age they will face."
"The global competition of the future demands not just that our children master the same knowledge that was imparted to us, but that they learn to use their minds in new and creative ways."
We have a history of excellence and achievement in our schools.
Colin Powell attended Morris High School in the Bronx.
Jonas Salk went to school in Queens.
The great author Joyce Carol Oates went to public schools in Amherst.
Our Brooklyn schools produced Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and baseball hall-of-famer Sandy Koufax.
There are countless other success stories.
There can and must be many more.
"But standing in the way is an education bureaucracy that is simply too large, too burdensome and too stifling."
"New York spends nearly $10,000 per pupil, more than virtually every other state."
"Despite this great investment, our schools are not keeping pace to prepare our children for the 21st Century."
"In part, that's because only about half the money the state sends to local schools ever gets to the classroom.That is simply wrong.It must end and it will."
Our plan focuses attention where it belongs -- on our children.
My plan dedicates more than $10 billion to education.
We must ensure that money is spent where it should be spent.
"To that end, I have proposed establishing school district ""report cards"" that will inform the taxpayers and parents about the administrative costs and academic performance of their schools."
I know that teachers want to teach.
It isn't these teachers who are failing our children.
It is the system that too often fails our children.
"Just as teachers want to teach, most students want to learn."
"In order to create a safe and secure learning environment for both teachers and students, I will propose giving real authority to teachers to remove disruptive students from the classroom."
"Amazingly, they don't have the proper authority to do it now."
We cannot allow those who refuse to learn to hold back those who want to learn.
"And as we strive to improve the education of our students, we must work to lower the burden of school taxes."
We can and we must continue mandate relief and begin using lottery dollars to reduce school taxes across New York State.
"In addition to these reforms, I have asked Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross to lead a new effort to develop fundamental solutions to the economic and academic problems facing our schools."
This Educational Excellence Project will develop a blueprint for reform that will ensure our schools are helping our children prepare for the era to come.
"While we make changes this year to improve our schools, I have asked the Lieutenant Governor to submit to me her comprehensive reforms by September 1."
Education is 30 percent of New York State's budget.
It is 100 percent of our future.
"ENVIRONMENT This past year, we took historic steps toward fulfilling our vision of a New York that has room for both sound economic growth and strong environmental protection."
We protected Long Island's Pine Barrens.
"The historic agreement signed this past June creates our state's third forest preserve and improves our future by protecting open spaces, ecological habitats and drinking water, and it encourages economic growth through responsible planning."
The wildfires that swept through the Pine Barrens demonstrate how important it is to preserve our open spaces.
The fact that these fires resulted in no loss of life is nothing short of miraculous.
That miracle occurred in large part because of the magnificent spirit of voluntarism that swept through Long Island faster than any wildfire ever could.
Thousands of New Yorkers fought side by side for three days against the raging fires of the Pine Barrens.
Thousands of volunteers from almost 200 fire companies fought to protect people and homes against a wildfire out of control.And they won.I was there.
"I looked on in admiration as men and women from across Long Island laid down the instruments of their everyday lives and climbed into water pumpers, stump jumpers, brush trucks and other machines to risk their lives to protect someone else's neighborhood, and someone else's life."
"On behalf of the people of Long Island and the citizens of New York State, I thank all of those who contributed to this great humanitarian effort.You are all heroes."
"* * * * * This year, we concluded a historic Watershed agreement that safeguards the drinking water for more than nine million people in and around New York City, and preserves the property rights of the people of the Hudson Valley and the Catskills.We solved the problem."
"And in doing so, we removed from the people of New York City the potential burden of building an incredibly expensive filtration plant, while protecting the rights of people to drink clean water and to own property."
This historic agreement is a testimony to what the state government can accomplish -- and will continue to accomplish -- by acting as the servant of the people.
"We can, we must and we will do more."
"This year, we will work to replicate our successes -- this time in the Adirondacks and along the shores of Long Island Sound."
"The ecology of the Sound is fragile, and further neglect threatens our future."
I intend to lead a bi-state effort with Connecticut and the federal government to begin the long process of cleaning up Long Island Sound.
It is time for New York to have a solid action plan to restore the greatness of the Sound.
"And with your help, we must begin this effort this year."
The Adirondacks are also a magnificent resource.They link us to our past.
They provide a glimpse into our future.
Our efforts in the Adirondacks will further demonstrate our vision of developing a consensus that will make New York State the leader in environmental protection while allowing for economic prosperity.
"Today, I am announcing that the state has purchased an important portion of the Whitney estate known as Canoe Carry East, in the town of Long Lake in the Adirondacks."
"This purchase of more than 375 acres, with Environmental Protection Fund money, will preserve public access to Forked Lake and the Raquette River along a popular canoe route in the heart of the Adirondack Park."
"As we add more than $100 million to the Environmental Protection Fund, and fund a new class of Environmental Conservation Officers to enforce our laws, we can, we must and we will regain New York's role as an environmental leader."
"HEALTH CARE The people of New York State have a right to expect the finest health care in the nation, at a cost they can afford."
"But in recent years, costs have soared while the quality of care did not improve with it."
"In 1995, we made great progress toward making sure our citizens receive quality, efficient and effective health care."
"Through managed care, more Medicaid recipients are receiving the important preventive and primary care they need to get healthy and to remain healthy."
Costly use of emergency room for routine care is down.
"More people are using family doctors to treat their everyday illnesses, and to provide the care needed to ensure healthy families.We are moving forward."
But we still have a long way to go.
"We can, we must and we will design a health care system that ensures that our people continue to receive the highest quality health care, and at lower cost."
"We must do this while building on New York State's rightful place as home to the best doctors, nurses and hospitals; the finest therapists and surgeons in the country."
And we must protect our newborns and their mothers.
"I will propose that we guarantee insurance coverage for at least two days of hospital maternity care, to assure that both the mother and the infant are healthy before they go home."
"This is a decision that should be made by doctors and mothers, not insurers and Health Maintenance Organizations."
A task force headed by Health Commissioner Dr. Barbara DeBuono has just completed its work on how to prepare New York's health care system for the challenges of the 21st Century.
"As you know, our hospital reimbursement system ends on June 30."
"The task force has recommended solutions that, among other things, would attack the growth in health care spending and give hospitals greater freedom to make their own decisions on costs."
"I am currently reviewing Dr. DeBuono's recommendations and, working with you, we will move forward with a comprehensive health care reform proposal."
"This plan, which I will submit in the weeks ahead, will ensure our people continue to receive the efficient, effective health care they deserve, at a price they can afford."
"Our commitment to ensuring good health care requires particular attention be paid to preventing one of the most damaging of illnesses, breast cancer."
"Many from all walks of life have contributed to this fight, including my wife, Libby, who has done great work this past year with survivors of breast cancer."
"Libby, you have helped raise public awareness of this terrible illness, and on the behalf of the people, and as your husband, I thank you."
There has been increasing concern about whether the incidence of breast cancer and other illness is related to pesticide use.
This concern is particularly strong on Long Island.
That is why I will include in my 30-day budget amendments funding for scholars at Cornell University to work with the state to computerize and coordinate information on pesticides and pesticide usage throughout the state.
"This information will be correlated with data on breast cancer incidence, and will help us identify areas where further action or study is needed."
"Through this cooperative effort, and with this new public registry, we will gain greater weapons in our continuing fight against this dreaded illness."
"STREAMLINING GOVERNMENT Government must meet the challenges of the 21st Century with new ideas, and innovative solutions."
"At the same time, government must know the limitations of government and encourage every person to take every opportunity to achieve his or her dreams."
Home ownership is part of the American dream.
"As Governor, I want each New Yorker to have a share in that dream, because nothing is more fundamental than owning your own home."
"To that end, this year Commissioner Joe Holland and I will propose ways to make government housing available for ownership by the people who live there."
Residents of public housing have the same hopes and aspirations as all New Yorkers.
We can and we must work together to ensure they have the freedom to experience the pride that comes with owning one's own home.
"In 1995, we moved ahead with our efforts to enable private enterprise to provide those services best provided by the private sector."
"Privatization can and will create success in many areas of our society, and return government to its proper role."
"In too many instances, our government entities have gotten away from that proper role."
"In New York City, the Port Authority actually owned a hotel -- the Vista Hotel."
"Government shouldn't be in the hotel business, and this past year, the Port Authority sold the Vista.It should do more."
"Today, I am renewing my call for the Port Authority to sell the World Trade Center and use the proceeds for such projects as the new Penn Station project advocated by Senator Moynihan, for direct rail links to downtown Manhattan, and for other mass transit and economic development projects in New York City and the Port Authority district."
"The Port Authority can be a tremendous asset to New York City and the entire region.This year, it began changing.It can and it must do more."
"ENERGY New York State is preparing to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, and we are preparing to lead the nation."
The opening of the electric utility industry to competition is a major sea-change facing our state and our nation.And we are ready.
We are taking steps to ensure that the people of New York and their employers receive efficient and affordable energy.
"As we reduce the gross receipts tax, we must encourage still lower rates by opening New York State's electric markets to the competitive forces of the free market."
"On Long Island, people for years have been paying outrageously high electric rates."
"That will stop, with our plan to dismantle LILCO, and bring down rates while protecting local property taxpayers."
"Our free-market system, grows stronger through competition."
That must include the energy marketplace.
Give our people the freedom to make the choices they want to make.
That is good for all New Yorkers.
* * * * * It takes courage to bring about change.
"But I know that you, the men and women in this body, have the courage to get the job done."
"If we can go forward in a bipartisan spirit to bring about the changes the people want, we will not fail."
I remember one Sunday afternoon not too long ago when I was sitting on a plane en route to Israel.
"It was a sad, dark afternoon, and a somber flight because I was leading a delegation of New Yorkers to attend the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin."
"I sat on the plane with the Speaker of this great Assembly, Sheldon Silver, with our Comptroller, Carl McCall, with Ed Koch, and with Mayor Giuliani."
"On this sad day, on this plane flight across the world and during our time in Jerusalem -- a time we all desperately wished never was necessary -- we sat together."
"Shelly, Carl, Ed, Rudy, and me."
"We represented much of the breadth of New York -- Christian and Jew, Democrat and Republican, black and white, farm and city."
"And yet, our feelings as New Yorkers were as one."
We shared the sadness of the loss of our friend.
"Moments like that remind us that in end, all the small political victories, all the skirmishes that seem so important at the time, are so small in the broad picture of our lives."
"They are meaningless when compared to our common goal for a better, stronger New York."
They disappear in the context of our true love for the people of this great state.
"Those moments remind us that in the endeavors that move us forward as a people, we can, we must, and we will act as one."
There are only four years to the millennium.
There is so little time to set New York State right again.There is so much still to do.
"But if we keep our resolve and our courage, stand up to the barriers that have stood in our way, we can bring true greatness back to our people."
"Together, we can unleash the spirit of New York."
"Freedom, personal responsibility and individual liberty need to be the hallmarks of our commitment."
"By lowering taxes, protecting our people, and making government less intrusive in our lives; by creating a safer New York State at home, in the workplace and in the classroom, and by creating a healthier environment -- we will continue down the path to the renewal of greatness this state and its people deserve.The mandate is to each of us."
"Ninety-seven years ago, on January 2, 1899, Governor Theodore Roosevelt delivered his State of the State message."
He talked about the great efforts of New Yorkers in the war against Spain.
About how our people defended humanity and national honor against the threat posed to our hemisphere by tyranny.
"In this grand message to the people of New York, Governor Roosevelt handed the mantle of responsibility to each of us."
"He said: ""We must always keep in mind the fact that ultimately each man's salvation rests mainly with himself.Governor Roosevelt was right."
"Freedom carries with it individual liberties, and personal responsibility."
"The people of New York State have exercised their freedom, and placed each of us in this great Chamber this afternoon."
"This freedom, this liberty that exists only in America, fills our future with beauty, with promise, and with dreams come true."
"This January day, we take the next step on the road toward achieving that beauty, toward fulfilling that promise.It is all within our grasp.We can succeed.We must succeed.We will succeed."
The people are depending on it.
"I look forward to working with each of you in the months ahead -- on behalf of all the people of New York State -- not just for the coming year, but for the comming generations Thank you, and God bless."
