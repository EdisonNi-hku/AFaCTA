SENTENCES
"Good evening, fellow Hoosiers, colleagues and friends."
"Speaker Gregg, Senator Garton, Representative Mannweiler, Senator Young, Chief Justice Shepard and Judge Sharpnack, leaders all, thank you for hosting me in this joint session."
"Joe Kernan, Jeff Modisett and I were inaugurated exactly a year ago today -- and what a day that was."
All those good feelings made me consider giving this speech outdoors.
But it wouldn't be the same; it's not quite cold enough.
"For more than a year now, Joe has been my partner."
"He's my good friend, a remarkable human being, and an extraordinary public servant."
"Unfortunately, he couldn't be with us this evening."
"He had to go back East to be with his mother, who is losing a bout with cancer."
"Our thoughts and our prayers are with him, and with his entire family."
"We stand here at a time of prosperity, looking ahead to the next millennium."
More Hoosiers are working now than ever before -- more than three million.
"In good jobs, with wages you can raise a family on."
"In fact, we lead the nation in growth of median household income -- it rose almost nine percent in 1996.A dry statistic?Far from it."
"For the typical Hoosier family, that's over $2,000 more a year."
"Last session, you joined me in charting a responsible course in these bountiful times -- making needed investments and returning money to Hoosier families."
"At the same time, we're keeping enough in reserve for any ups and downs in the economy."
"We've invested in Indiana's future: more police on the streets, alternative schools, safe haven after school programs, and new roads."
"We've also cut taxes by more than $300 million over the next two years, for working families, for homeowners, and for businesses."
"And we've maintained a prudent $1.1 billion reserve, to secure our State's financial future."
All of this going into our tenth year without a State tax increase.
"When it comes to taxes, only one other state in the nation can make that claim."
"These were good, common-sense decisions."
"In fact, the national investor services, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, have just upgraded the state's bond rating, an objective index of fiscal health."
And this has an immediate benefit: the higher ratings should save Hoosier taxpayers at least $19 million.
"From both Wall Street and Main Street, we've won praise for our conservative fiscal management."
"But, as I've said, weíre not talking about numbers alone -- we're talking about lives, putting Hoosier families first."
"Last year, we were able to change the lives of some remarkable Hoosiers."
"I'd like to share their stories with you, and we're fortunate to have most of them with us this evening."
"Emily Hunt, of Indianapolis, was four years old when she went to an amusement park.There was a tragic accident."
It killed her grandmother and left Emily paralyzed.
"Thanks to the steadfastness of this brave little girl and her determined father, we took action."
"Emily's staggering medical bills are covered now, and all amusement rides in Indiana will undergo tougher inspections and carry more insurance."
Dan Cicatko of Huntington lost both his arms in a factory accident.
"Because of a bill we approved last session, his family will no longer be forced to choose between their son's schooling or replacing Dan's prosthetic devices."
Bob Coleman is a new sheriff's deputy down in Switzerland County.
It's a corner of the state where folks often feel forgotten by Indianapolis.
He is among some 500 more police officers we invested in last session.
"Until this past year, women who survived breast cancer -- like State Senator Beverly Gard -- often faced huge medical bills for reconstructive surgery and prosthetic devices."
"Last year, we approved legislation to make sure those expenses would be covered under health insurance policies written in the state of Indiana."
"Bev Gard wrote that bill, and it will soon be making a difference to Hoosier women and their families."
Natasha DeHaai is a sixteen year old in Lafayette.
"In just one semester of high school, this young woman had cut nearly 300 classes."
"But when I met her last fall, she was thriving in an alternative school that provided structure and discipline."
"She handed me a note, and in it she said the program saved her."
"All over the state, students have told me the same thing: going to an alternative school enabled them to turn their lives around."
Eloise Blackmon of Gary has made a successful transition from welfare to work.
She is part of the transformation of public assistance from a handout to a hand up.
"With the help of non-profit groups and churches, we've provided a road to self sufficiency, with child care and job training."
Our welfare rolls are now at their lowest point in 26 years.
"And as I called upon businesses to pitch in, I pledged that State government will hire 200 recipients of public assistance."
"They'll do meaningful work, without displacing any current State workers."
"As a part of our two year budget, we cut taxes more than $300 million."
Families like John and Sue Baker in Fort Wayne will save $109 on their property taxes this year.
They plan to put it toward replacing their old furnace.
We've put Hoosier families first.
"And even with the tax cuts people will start to see this year, we have still maintained a necessary reserve of more than $1.1 billion."
"Thanks to Indiana's strong economy, our reserve is now projected to rise back up to $1.6 billion."
This gives us an excellent opportunity to build on the progress made last year and provide additional relief to Hoosier taxpayers.
"By the next legislative session, we'll have on our desks the report of the Citizens' Commission on Taxes."
Some members of the General Assembly serve on this bipartisan panel.
"This top-to-bottom review of our tax structure, the first in at least a generation, is nearly done."
"You understand how crucial it is that we not make more, piecemeal changes."
But Hoosier families should not have to wait to share the benefits of this year's higher-then-expected reserve.
"After all, it was created largely by their tax dollars."
Let's get their money back to them directly.
I believe the best way to do this is to send every Hoosier taxpayer a check.
But I recognize this isn't the only way.
"There are other serious proposals on the table, and I will work with the legislature to find common ground.My bottom line is simple."
"I will sign a tax cut that does not jeopardize school funding, that does not increase the base budget, that does not create an operating deficit, and that does not reduce our reserve below $1.1 billion."
Why draw a line in the sand at $1.1 billion?
Because our State learned a hard lesson in the recession of the early 1980s: you can't prepare for a downturn when you're already in a downturn.
"Only in the sunshine can you plan for a rainy day.Otherwise, you end up soaked."
And that must not happen again to our State and to its taxpayers.
Let me say a few words about this short session.
"Last year, we put a two year budget in place and it's working well."
I don't foresee any necessary changes in the budget at this time.
"But within the existing budget, I'm putting forward several new initiatives for children, that put Hoosier families first."
"At the top of my children's agenda is education, better schools."
"On everyone's mind, obviously, are the recent ISTEP Plus scores."
"This year's test results, with their serious implications for the students who took them, are a call to action for all of us."
Our first obligation is to work with the young people who didn't pass the first time.
I propose to give them extra help by reallocating money in the current budget.
Nothing is more important than giving these kids the skills to pass the test in the next two years.
"At the same time, let's not forget those students who are doing well."
"From the ISTEP Plus results, we can see our state has many academic achievers."
"Considering the importance of standardized tests in college admissions, we ought to encourage even more high school students to take them."
I propose we reimburse the costs of the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test for all sophomores and juniors.
"Looking toward the future, we must continue to set higher standards -- not lower ones -- for our students and schools."
"Instead of lowering the bar, our goal is to ensure that Hoosier students make it over the bar."
And our students must be able to compete in a global economy.
That is only possible when they are held to first-class standards.
"Toward that end, I'm asking the legislature to approve an Academic Standards Commission."
"This panel will bring together education, business, government and communities to assess, strengthen and promote the standards to which our students will be held."
"Finally, as we work for better schools, we have to bear in mind that nothing we do in government can take the place of parents, nor should it."
"In fact, new scientific evidence makes it clearer than ever that parental involvement is vital -- both to every child, and to our society."
New brain research now tells us that critical years of a childís development occur before he or she enters school.
"The learning capacity of infants and toddlers can actually be expanded by talking to them, reading to them, playing with them."
"Parents need this information, which is a critical piece of building bright beginnings for young Hoosiers."
"The findings are both revolutionary and common sense: from birth, stimulation, attention and affection promote human brain development and intelligence."
"A leading expert, Dr. Bruce Perry of Baylor University, calls experience the chief architect of the brain."
It helps form the connections in the brain along which impulses travel; those connections make us who we are.
Youngsters deprived of physical affection and chances to play have brains between one-fifth and one-third smaller than most of their peers.
"These findings must have a profound impact on how, what, and when we teach -- and on our entire body of public policy affecting infants, children and families."
"In fact, the greatest challenge before my administration may well be to integrate these scientific findings into public policy."
"How can we best encourage parents to do the hugging, singing, and reading that make their children smarter?"
How can we make preschool more educationally enriching?
How can we best catch and correct a child's learning problems early?
How can we foster community service focused on ages zero to three?
"How can we make it possible for parents to spend more time with their children, and to make it count?"
"You will be hearing a lot more about early childhood issues from me, and I am looking forward to working on them with the General Assembly in future sessions."
"But ""Building Bright Beginnings"" for Hoosier children starts not with legislation but with information."
We need to get the word out: we can have a huge impact on the learning ability of our infants and toddlers.
"Starting tomorrow, I'll be visiting children's wards in hospitals all over the state to deliver that message."
I'll be unveiling a growth chart filled with useful tips about what can be done to stimulate learning in a child's first five years.
This chart will go home with the parents of every newborn.
Also tomorrow I'll premiere a series of public service announcements that TV stations will be airing all over Indiana.
"And I'll be working through my Community Service Round table to encourage more efforts like Fort Wayne's ""Read To Me"" program -- where volunteers read to children in doctors' waiting rooms and give away books."
Let me mention briefly three other initiatives for our state's children.
We have new federal funds to provide health coverage for the children of working families.
"I've brought together a bipartisan, citizens' group to make sure we use it well."
"We are also proposing legislation that would make it easier for the State to protect young people, and others, from sexual predators."
"This bill would create be a valuable tool for law enforcement, and I hope you'll support it."
"The third initiative deals with youngsters in dire straits: those who linger in foster care, desperate for a loving, permanent home."
Adoption must be made easier and faster.
"And it will be, under legislation I encourage you to pass this session."
"Before I close, let me take a moment to touch on a bedrock Hoosier value: the need to get outside yourself and give something back, to the leave the world a better place than you found it."
"As Judy and I travel the state, we often speak of community service."
"We join others as they pitch in for, and with, their neighbors."
Community service connects us all.
"It's more than just helping out for an hour or two, and then going home."
"Rather, to Hoosiers, community service is about reaching within ourselves to reach out to others."
"Service is a tradition, a way of life."
And gifts in each of us can serve as seeds for growth.
"We all have gifts, whether they be talents, or time, or dollars.Interconnectedness."
This will continue to build our state -- and the communities in it -- as we get ready for the next millennium.
"In just three years, we will enter a new era, as time is measured by humankind."
"These are valuable years, not just for celebration, but for learning and growth."
For shaping our goals through a deeper understanding of our past and present.
So I am asking all Hoosiers to come together as families and as communities and ask themselves these four questions: What has brought us to this present place and condition?
What and where are we today as individuals in community?
"What is our vision of the future, specifically in 2016, the bicentennial year of Indiana?"
What can and will we do to reach our vision of the future?
Our newly formed Millennium Task Force will be working with communities around the state as they come together to answer these questions.
"It is in the ""doing together"" that we become a true community."
"Right now, a strong economy is building a stronger Indiana."
"We can seize this moment, use our strength wisely."
"Invest in our children and youth, in our schools, in our future."
"Cut taxes and still maintain our reserve, and put Hoosier families first."
These goals should guide all that we do here over the next two months.
"Finally, the spirit of the people of Indiana is an awesome thing.Emily Hunt.Dan Cicatko.Bob Coleman.Natasha DeHaai.Eloise Blackmon.John and Sue Baker.And Bev Gard."
"In this State House we use the power ""inherent in the People,"" as our State Constitution says, to serve the public good."
"We translate Hoosier values into action: dedication to family and children, personal responsibility, and a commitment to community that's second to none."
"I urge you to join me in dedicating this session to our next generation, the young people of the state of Indiana.To our future, and to theirs.Thank you."
