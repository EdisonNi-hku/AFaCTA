Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Madam Chief Justice, Members of the Kansas Legislature and Fellow Kansans: Today Kansas is an attractive place to pursue the American dream -- a place to raise a family, to work, to play, to invest.
Kansas is recognized throughout the world as a friendly and prosperous state made so by the hard work and solid values of its citizens.
In my year as Governor I've learned firsthand, the 83,000 square miles we call home, from Galena to Goodland, from Elwood to Elkhart, is a state of great opportunity.
It is our responsibility to enhance opportunity for all Kansans.
Tonight, and for the remainder of this legislative session, I invite you to join me in that task.
Promises Kept This will be a challenging task, but one made less difficult by successes of the past year.
These achievements would not have been realized without the diligence and dedication of many talented Kansans who selflessly offered their service to our state.
For that I am grateful.
The state of our state today is sound and the prospects for our future are bright, in part, because of those who serve in our legislature and those who serve in my cabinet.
My cabinet officials have performed their duties wi th purpose and professionalism.
"It's been said that Andrew Carnegie was successful because, ""He was a man who knew how to enlist the service of better men than himself."
Thankfully, I have enlisted the service of both better men and women.
I thank each one of them for their hard work.
Because of their work and the support of this Legislature, I can report significant progress in the implementation of the agenda I presented a year ago.
We heard the people of Kansas asking for tax relief, and we responded by cutting their taxes over five years by nearly one billion dollars.
We achieved this by repealing the anti-growth sales taxes on labor used in new construction and on utilities consumed in production.
Tax savings: $165 million.
We provided a 5-year, 53% reduction in the personal property taxes Kansans pay on motor vehicles.
Tax savings: $396 million.
We provided relief to thousands of Kansas businesses with a 2-year moratorium on unemployment taxes.
Tax savings: $395 million.
"We embarked on new initiatives to ""turn out the lights"" on obsolete programs and to privatize programs or services that can be better performed by the private sector."
"The state saved $1.5 million through the ""Make it -- Take it"" program which encourages state employees to identify wasteful practices."
Our 6-month moratorium on new government regulations was followed by the elimination of 530 needless or obsolete regulations.
"My cabinet secretaries aggressively pursued the ""rightsizing"" of government."
Prioritizing, privatizing, downsizing, they made the tough decisions necessary to cut current fiscal year expenditures.
Included in that strategy is a 5% reduction in staff levels by the end of fiscal year 1997.
But we gave Kansans more than tax relief and efficient government.
We reduced barriers to childhood immunization.
Kansas ranks 11th in the nation and is on target to achieve the national goal of a 90% rate by the year 2000.
Because a hungry child can't be a healthy child, our Childhood Hunger Task Force report will serve as a guide for appropriate public and private sector response.
We preserved our state's traditional investment in public education with additional dollars allocated to every public school district in Kansas.
The Economic Development Initiative Fund was protected by renewing the Kansas Lottery to assure the $42.5 million annual investment in the economic security of Kansas.
We provided full funding for the comprehensive highway program.
We enhanced the Ethics Commission's capacity to enforce laws governing the conduct of elected officials.
Violent crime is down and efforts to hold criminals more accountable to society and to their victims have been successfully enacted.
Finally, during my tenure as Governor both Kansas State and Kansas University are undefeated in bowl games.
It's this foundation of promises kept, progress made that positions us for continued success.
Austere but Fair The cornerstone of my message to you this evening is fiscal responsibility.
It is this responsibility that underlies our capacity to serve the people of Kansas.
That's why I'm proposing a budget which is austere but fair -- a budget which allows state government to live within its means -- but with means adequate to meet our state's needs.
This is an honest budget which neither sacrifices the future nor penalizes the present.
The fiscal challenges confronting our state government are significant: A shortfall of $25 million in last year's revenues.
A potential loss of nearly $42 million in federal funds in the coming year.
Forced compliance with a federal ruling regarding payment of property taxes by mortgage holders will create a $34 million shortfall.
The state's potential $150 million liability in the single taxpayer lawsuit.
Unresolved spending decisions including potential prison construction, new highway programs, Regent university capital improvements and Wildlife and Parks infrastructure needs.
And finally, the added uncertainty of federal budget restructuring.
The positive news is a very recent one-time general fund receipt of $31 million.
While significant, it does represent less than 1% of general fund expenditures, and is nearly equal to the shortfall we experienced last year.
With the enormous fiscal uncertainties we face, combined with a need to discipline ourselves not to spend every dollar we get our hands on, this one-time benefit should not be considered an additional source of revenue, but as insurance to meet the legal requirements of the 7.5% ending balance.
The fiscal 1997 budget I submit to you is an honest balanced budget.
My general fund budget spends less than the state will take in.
No smoke and mirrors, no robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Except for years following state tax increases, this is the first budget in 20 years in which expenditures have been limited to less than State General Fund revenues.
It is particularly remarkable in a year following significant tax cuts.
Additionally, for the first time in 25 years my budget spends less from all funding sources than was spent last year.
"This is truly significant when you consider that the growth of ""all funds"" has averaged 8.4% over the last 20 fiscal years."
My budget proposal includes very modest growth in State General Fund expenditures at the rate of only 1.4% over the previous year.
This compares dramatically with the annual growth rate in State General Fund spending of 8.2% averaged over the last 20 years.
The limited rate of growth in 1997 state general funds spending is driven in large part by K-12 enrollment growth, funding the second year of high correlation weighting, and increased social service caseloads.
I accept legitimate debate of my spending priorities, but I expect that debate to occur within the budget parameters I have set.
Any attempt to spend more dollars than I have recommended is absolutely not acceptable.
The fiscal challenges, constraints and uncertainties I have mentioned also require prudent management of revenues.
There have been many tax cutting proposals suggested for possible legislative action.
We should, however, remember that our present choices determine future consequences.
"As Abraham Lincoln said, ""You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."
I will not allow today's legislative actions to undermine our state government's ability to meet the challenges and uncertainties of our fiscal future.
To leave no doubt, let me state with clarity my position on general fund tax proposals: Any tax measure increasing property taxes will be vetoed.
Any tax measure increasing sales taxes will be vetoed.
Any tax measure increasing income taxes will be vetoed.
Any tax measure reducing revenue without acceptable corresponding spending reductions will be vetoed.
And any tax cut based on speculation of long-term uncertain revenues will be vetoed.
I know my language is strong.
But my commitment to fiscal responsibility is even stronger.
This is not about any party, any person or any proposal.
It's about fiscal reality.
"It's been said that, ""a leader who sells principles for popularity will become bankrupt ."
and so will the state.
Austere budgets require more of our state employees.
At a time in which we are asking our state employees to deliver more, it is essential we recognize they are the heart and soul of state government.
My budget continues to require they work hard to seek innovative and efficient ways to meet their obligations to the people of Kansas, but it also attempts to recognize their service.
My budget accommodates full funding of step movement on the pay matrix and funds longevity bonuses for those whose length of service places them at the highest tier of the step movement matrix.
A merit pool for unclassified employees is also funded.
Through an understanding of the changing marketplace, we have funded enhanced health insurance benefits for employees without increasing the premium cost of this important benefit.
I recognize the sacrifices our state employees make and I appreciate their continued hard work in service to our state.
Delivering More When I was a candidate for Governor my father offered me what turned out to be some good advice.
"He said, when it comes to utilizing state resources remember the lessons of the trucking industry: ""load â€˜em high and tight"" -- and that's what our budget does."
But Dad's advice didn't end there.
He went on to say that to be successful, government, like business must deliver more -- deliver more than the customer expects, on time and on budget.
Let me share with you my plans for delivering more to Kansans.
Public Education Even with a budget that resonates with austerity we have made significant investments in programs and services important to the future vitality of our state.
No investment is more important to me than public education.
We will maintain the increased funding level we provided last year of $3,626 per pupil and invest new monies of: $6.3 million for increased school enrollment; $10 million for the second year of high correlation weighting; and a $4.7 million increase for special education.
State law requires that the statewide property tax mill levy dedicated to funding public education be reconsidered by the legislature.
I fully support its renewal.
I will not allow the schoolchildren of Kansas to be held hostage to election year politics.
Logic, prudence and common sense lead me to one conclusion: renewing the 35 mills is the right thing to do and I am committed to ensuring it is done.
Our Regents universities also comprise an essential element of our state's commitment to education.
In response to the need to comply with accessibility standards, fire and safety codes, and in recognition of the crumbling condition of many of our campus buildings, I am endorsing a $163 million facilities repair and rehabilitation program.
This program is especially prudent when one considers that the interest to be paid on the bonds issued is lower than the rate of inflation for construction costs.
Also Regents institutions need greater flexibility in budgeting and more accountability in performance.
To begin this process, I am recommending greater tuition accountability at Kansas State and Kansas University, performance grants for state general funds flexibility at all universities, and the development of meaningful performance measures for all institutions.
Water Quality Initiative In October, I announced an initiative to restore the quality of water in the Kansas-Lower Republican Basin.
My cabinet agencies were instructed to develop and implement a plan to protect and improve the surface waters of this diverse river basin.
Government cannot and will not solve our water quality problems alone.
The tenants of this water quality initiative are agency cooperation, coordination of programs, partnerships with the private sector, management at the local level and the focus of resources to the highest priority areas.
Please assist us in this effort by assuring State Water Plan Funds are spent appropriately.
Public Safety Public safety remains a core concern of our citizens and a responsibility to state government.
Crime rates are down because we have chosen to send a consistent, tough message to criminals and would-be criminals: if you choose to violate the laws of this state, you will be punished.
The commitment to be tough on crime carries with it the obligation to fund necessary prison space.
In expanding our prison capacity I intend to pursue three options.
First, we will look for every appropriate, safe and legal avenue available to increase prison capacity, including double-celling; second, we will convert existing state facilities for correctional use whenever appropriate; and finally, new construction.
Effective use of federal funding will significantly reduce state expense under any of these options.
Whichever of these options or combinations of options provide the necessary space, at the lowest cost, and the required safety, will be pursued.
Within the limits of our fiscal resources, I support the concepts of the package formulated by the Kansas Youth Authority you created last year.
"Entitled ""The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 1996,"" this comprehensive program seeks to instill what is desperately needed in our system of juvenile justice -- accountability."
We must do everything we can to see that this year's juvenile offender is not next year's violent criminal.
Public safety is also impacted by our traffic laws.
As a result of federal legislation, it is now up to the legislature to determine speed limits on interstate and state highways.
The chairmen of the Senate and House Transportation Committees, and I have agreed on the following plan: To increase speed limits on Kansas interstate highways to no more than 70 miles per hour.
To preserve the 10 mile per hour speed limit differential on interstate highways located in urban areas.
To increase from 55 miles per hour to no more than 65 miles per hour the speed limit on improved two-lane state highways.
Under this proposal the Secretary of Transportation will have full authority to designate those Kansas highways for which a speed limit of 65 miles per hour would be unsafe.
In conjunction, with our concern for safety on Kansas roads, I am tonight endorsing zero tolerance legislation which would create a presumption of intoxication for any driver less than 21 years of age with a blood alcohol content of .02 or greater.
Economic Development Building on our shared initiative of last year, I ask that you extend the two-year unemployment insurance tax moratorium for an additional third year.
This will increase the savings of Kansas businesses by an additional $150 million and allow them to invest in business development and job creation.
We must provide jobs for Kansas.
To remain competitive in attracting new businesses and retain home-grown businesses, I am proposing an aggressive and significant package of economic development incentives.
This package has been developed as a flexible and creative way of assuring our state's continued good economic health.
Gaming There always seem to be controversial issues that defy statutory resolution.
An expansion of gaming is one of them.
That's why I strongly believe the time has come to let Kansans decide whether to allow expanded forms of gambling, just as they decided issues such as liquor by-the-drink, the creation of a Kansas Lottery, pari-mutuel wagering and bingo.
I suggest a proposed constitutional amendment patterned after the pari-mutuel amendment that would allow up to two non-profit organizations in each congressional district to establish one location in which electronic games of chance could be played.
If the legislature chooses to act with dispatch on this issue the measure could be presented to voters in the April presidential preference primary.
Hospital Closure Last session this legislature authorized the creation of a hospital closure commission.
I respect their judgment and fully endorse their conclusions.
My administration is working to assist both communities affected and the patients impacted.
My fiscal 1997 budget includes $1 million in new money which will allow a smooth transition into the community for patients leaving these facilities.
Additionally, my budget fully funds the mental health reform plans approved by this legislature.
Spending Limits Although much of what I have said tonight focuses on the specifics of my budget, I also want to use this occasion to reiterate my support for a constitutionally mandated cap on the rate of growth in government spending.
Although I can assure you I will continue to propose state budget expenditures which grow no more than the rate of growth in our state's citizens personal income, I still see great merit in the enactment of reforms that impose discipline and restraint on the rate of growth of government spending.
We should all be able to agree that government expenditures should not exceed the ability of citizens to pay for them.
I urge you to give this concept serious consideration.
Public Trust Initiative I propose a public trust initiative that will put reasonable and sound ethics policies in place.
This initiative will be based on a code of conduct for public service that places primary responsibility for maintaining high standards of conduct where it should be -- on public servants.
To this end, I am preparing an executive order that establishes such a code for state employees and Governor's appointees.
The code bans all gifts except those given at ceremonies and public functions where the state employee is accepting the gift in his or her official capacity.
It restricts the acceptance of food and drink, when it is in exchange for exclusive access to the governmental official.
And, it limits acceptance of travel and entertainment that serves no specific state interest or purpose.
I call on you to enact legislation to bring the governor and all statewide elected officials under the same restrictions for accepting campaign contributions during the legislative session which apply to each of you that serve in the legislature.
But that law needs even more strength.
We must ban solicitation, as well as acceptance of those categories of campaign contributions during the legislative session.
And we must broaden the prohibition to include contributions from corporations and unions.
To strengthen our lobbying laws, I also recommend reporting all expenditures during a reporting period, not just those in excess of $100.
When people believe in the fairness and integrity of government, the process is vested with greater credibility and purpose.
I ask that you join me in these investments in public trust.
During this session I know there will be numerous proposals to enhance public trust of government.
I encourage that debate and look forward to signing into law those proposals of merit.
Weights and Measures Finally, we will restore integrity to the weights and measures system.
Strong leadership will be provided by the Department of Agriculture and legislation will be proposed to enhance our efforts.
Conclusion These are a few of the issues which will be debated in the coming days.
I assure you, we will be engaged in the active pursuit of developing and implementing constructive public policy on a broad range of subjects to make certain Kansas government delivers more than is expected from its citizens.
"Last year in my State of the State message I quoted Carl Becker's work Kansas in which he stated, ""Idealism must always prevail on the frontier."
Becker reminded us that the frontier holds little hope for those who see things as they are.
"To venture into the wilderness, he said, ""one must see it, not as it is, but as it will be."
In the past year, in partnership with many dedicated Kansans, we began our journey into the frontier of reshaping Kansas government.
We have worked to create a government which reflects the pioneer virtues of Kansans -- a government built on self-reliance, one that recognizes the essential benefits of limited government, personal responsibility and a strong sense of community.
Kansans, through their work ethic and a tradition of self-determination, are striving in every community to build a better world for themselves, and their children .
their families.
Government cannot and should not be seen as the solution to every problem.
The budget I have submitted to you reflects the virtues of Kansans -- it is austere but fair.
It allows us to control government growth but does not compromise our ability to meet our needs.
The legislation I have endorsed tonight reflects my administration's commitment to a well educated Kansas, a safe Kansas, a healthy Kansas, a prosperous Kansas, and a fiscally sound Kansas -- a Kansas in which the American Dream remains a vibrant reality.
