Mr. Speaker Mr. President Honored Guests Members of the Legislature Fellow Citizens Despite our best efforts, the need remains.
Of course, I am speaking of the educational need of our state and people.
Our teachers still need paying.
Our professors still need a pay raise.
This is why we are here.
This continues to be the real problem plaguing our state.
This remains our challenge.
Over the past several days, newspapers have reported good news for our state.
Despite a troubled national economy, our state continues to have a net increase in new jobsYa substantial increase.
In the last two years, Louisiana has a net increase of about 40,000 jobs.
Several days ago, I noticed an article in the Baton Rouge paper that demonstrates where we could be.
Our neighborYMississippiYhas been having trouble holding on to jobs.
This may come as surprise to many of you, but this is reality.
In short, what is happening to other states can happen to Louisiana.
We can begin to have a net decrease in jobs as a result of this sluggish national economy.
It is our job to do all in our power to keep this from happening.
In the long run, this means education.
In the short run, this means education and anything else we can do to keep our citizens employed.
This administration has done those things necessary to keep jobs in our state.
When Louisiana Pacific at Urania in northeast Louisiana was in trouble, almost $4 million in tax exempt bonds were issued, and the industry assistance program is providing $30 million to this plant over the next ten years.
When the new General Motors facility in Shreveport needed help, we came up with almost $4 million for training plus another $4 or $5 million for other training and infrastructure requirements.
In case some memories are short, Louisiana awarded 684 industrial tax exemptions in 2000.
The net estimated tax relief is almost $600 million over the next ten years.
Some may argue the merits of this program, but you cannot argue the reality of these exemptions.
Orion refining.
almost $70 million.
Rubicon.
almost $30 million.
and so on.
While we will struggle with two specific issues in this special session, we are really working to find a way to address the educational need of our people.
These two issuesYHarrah's of New Orleans and the sailing status of the riverboat gaming industry of LouisianaYare issues we must confront today.
However, remember thisYthe way we get past such issues is by educating a citizenry that can produce, create, and build in the new economy of this new century.
I have heard several arguments for putting Harrah's out of business and thousands of folks out of work.
I am certain most make these arguments in good faith, but I feel compelled to give you the other side as a way of discussing this matter.
Argument One: Harrah's knew what they were getting into, and they should live up to their agreement.
For those of us who have spent some time making a payroll in business, I know we have been in similar situations.
However, I doubt we have been in the situation Harrah's finds itself.
Harrah's has been taxed at seven times the rate of Mississippi and Nevada gaming industries and more than double the rate of most of the Louisiana gaming industry.
Even under these conditions, we forced Harrah's to move from remodeling the Rivergate to creating the new facility in downtown New Orleans.
They may not have liked it, but they built it.
Moreover, after their first Chapter 11, I told them they must at least try to meet their original contract obligations at the $100 million a year figure.
I insisted that they do so for at least a year.
They did not like it, but we made them do it.
Argument Two: We are giving Harrah's a $40 million tax break, and they will not make it even if we work with them on the present agreement.
Given the agreements made between Harrah's and the hotel and restaurant industries, and after tax restructuring, Harrah's can and will be successful, in my opinion.
However, regardless if they succeed or fail, Louisiana will have a four-year guarantee of $230 million that is needed for the teachers and education in our state.
This is no tax break.
By failing to undertake this business arrangement, we will turn our backs on $230 million and some 3,000 jobs.
We give to get, but we get far more than we giveYthe essence of a good business deal.
Not only do we have a four year guarantee, but we have three year rolling clause.
We can never second guess ourselves whether a company will make it or not when we grant a tax exemption, or provide state dollars for employee training, or give any other type of assistance when a business is in trouble.
Argument # 3.
This is an expansion of gambling.
This argument reminds me of the bootleggers telling the church folks that letting a beer joint in town was an expansion of drinking.
As one wise soul said, Athis is not making more folks drinkYthis is making more bootleggers broke.
Few know this, so listen well.
The exclusivity granted to Harrah's acts as a damper on any additional gaming in New Orleans.
If this exclusivity is not in place, you will see a strong move for expansion of widespread gaming in the New Orleans area.
RememberYthe good people of Orleans Parish voted for gaming in their parish.
In fact, Orleans Parish supported gaming much stronger than most other parishes.
In short, a vote to support this contract is a vote for the status quo relative to gaming in New Orleans.
Now, there may be some people who do not want the status quo.
They may want to insure a spread of gaming in New Orleans.
They want Harrah's out of the way so they can profit.
The Biblical admonition is proper: ABeware of wolves in sheep's clothing.
Argument #4: The job market can absorb these people very quickly.
No doubt, we are continuing to create jobs in our state.
However, if you think this is so easy, look at Mississippi today.
It's not that easy.
Moreover, allow me to ask a simple and personal question: Would you like to lose your job and be forced to go look for work tomorrow?
It's like Harry Truman said: AA recession is when your neighbor is out of work, but a depression is when you're out of work.
Now, let's consider requiring riverboats to sail.
Some of you have argued we are engaged in making the law look silly, since the law requires riverboats to sail.
Friends, we are not the ones making the law look silly.
The riverboats are.
Despite attempting to enforce this law, let's be honestYthere's only about a 10% compliance rate.
Now, you can stick your heads in the sand and say it is not true when it is, or we can face the facts and do something about it.
Let's stop the charade.
Let's give the legal privilege to stay dockside and get the revenue for it.
Last year, the people of Louisiana sent all of us a very clear message.
They do not want to pay more taxes.
At the same time, they also told us that they want our teachers paid and educational system held accountable.
Frankly, according to numerous experts throughout our nation, our educational accountability plan is being hailed as the finest in our country.
We have made this step, and, given my recent meeting with Attorney General Ashcroft, I believe we are going to remove the federal courts from future plans to improve our schools.
we were able to do that in our prisons.
Now, we have to pay our teachers.
This plan begins to make this happen.
Dedicating gaming money to education is long overdue in our state.
When the lottery was passed, our people thought it would be used for education.
When our people voted for riverboats, video poker, and the casino, they thought this money would be used for education.
It's time to use the money for exactly what our people intended.
education.
For those who wring their hands and say we should not use gaming money to fund education, my response is simple: Take it up with your constituents because that is exactly what they wanted done with this money in the first place.
This is exactly the reason our people voted to allow gaming in our state.
to use the money to educate our children.
Any person who talks to the people of this state knows this is true.
After this session, at least, you will be able to tell your constituents: With this new money, we have done what you wanted.
we dedicated it to education.
While time is being wasted arguing about the merits of using gaming money to educate our children, other states are moving forward.
For example, the state of Georgia started the Hope Scholarship program several years ago.
It has been hailed nationwide.
This program has resulted in dramatic improvements at the University of Georgia.
improvements so dramatic that this university is now considered one of the finest in our nation.
According to the New York Times, almost every freshman at this university is awarded free tuition.
You must be wondering, how does Georgia pay for such a nationally acclaimed program?
The answer is simple: gaming money.
The revenues of the Georgia Lottery are dedicated to this program.
How did Mississippi make a commitment to increasing teacher salaries over the next years?
No doubt, the casinos along the gulf coast had a lot to do with it.
I could go on, but the point is obvious.
Other states are using gaming money for the purpose their people wanted.
It's time we do the same in Louisiana.
Our people are right.
Gaming money must make a difference to the education of our children.
It's time we listen.
It's time we act.
For those of you who have moral concerns about using gaming money for education, I remind you of a decision you made in this legislature several years ago.
You dedicated tobacco money for the TOPS program.
As you know, I like the bottom line, and the bottom line is this: this session is about doing what the people hoped would be done with the money obtained from gambling.
We are going to dedicate it to education so our children will be able to build an economy that does not depend on video poker, riverboats, or casinos.
Make no mistake, if we fail in this special session, there will be another one.
We will be back again and again until we deal with the real problem plaguing Louisiana.
I will not give up until it is fixed.
Let's dedicate this money to education.
Let's leave Louisiana with a plan to get this state competitive with all our neighbors on the educational frontier.
This is an opportunity that will not come again easily.
The longer we wait, the harder it will be.
I leave you with the following questions: If not this way, how?
If not now, when?
Thank You and God Bless Louisiana.
