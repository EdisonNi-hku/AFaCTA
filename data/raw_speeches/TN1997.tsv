Fresh from a year in which we celebrated our state's triumphs and treasures and took stock of our many blessings, I ask you tonight to focus on the greatest of our treasures and the most enduring of our blessings: Tennessee's children.
All of us have heard Whitney Houston sing: I believe the children are our future; Teach them well and let them lead the way Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

And that happy event is causing me to think anew about the kind of opportunity I'd like to help create, not just for my grandchildren, but for all children whose families call Tennessee home.
Last year, I shared with you my vision of creating in Tennessee a spirit and state of opportunity, where every child has: the chance to get a healthy start on life in a stable family, a safe community, and a clean, unspoiled natural environment; the chance to go to a good school and to be ready to learn when they get there; the chance to have the adult guidance and discipline to avoid the dangers of drugs and delinquency that can sidetrack a young person from life's right path; the chance to reach adulthood equipped for a lifetime of learning, and to be able to find a good job.
This year, I want to talk about what we can do to help Tennessee's families and Tennessee's children.
Government will never take the place of a strong family when it comes to giving a child love and nurturing, a sense of responsibility and self-worth, the ability to tell right from wrong.
But in an age when our families face new pressures and heightened demands, I believe there are ways government can help.
The priorities we have set for our state and which I reinforce in the budget you have before you are priorities the General Assembly has helped to choose and to shape.
We have a bipartisan commitment to improving education that spans two decades, from Governor Dunn's expansion of kindergarten and Governor Alexander's Better Schools Program, to Governor McWherter's Basic Education Program and 21st Century Classrooms --a commitment supported by many in this General Assembly and fully funded in each and every budget I have submitted to you.
Now, we are starting to look ahead at what it will take to create one of the nation's premier systems of public colleges, universities and technical schools through the Council for Excellence in Higher Education.

They can see and sense the pride and satisfaction that comes through honest hard work and genuine accomplishment.
We're giving those kids a glimpse of a better future, a reason to sense life's promise rather than dwell on life's problems.
Together, we have recognized that trustworthy child care services are essential for all working families and we have taken steps both to increase supply and to improve quality.
We worked with you to assure that mothers on welfare will have safe places to keep their children as they rejoin the working mainstream of Tennesseans.
In this budget, we will devote millions of additional dollars for that important purpose, and our administration will this week execute a plan to implement the recommendations of the Child Care Task Force I appointed last year.
Working together, we have placed Tennessee on the cutting edge in the development of services for children at-risk and in-trouble.
As a result, fewer children are in state custody, and more children are receiving our early and preventive assistance.
Saving children early saves money later; and in time, I hope to take those savings and target them to the needs of at-risk pre-schoolers.
We have worked together to assure that Tennessee remains a place of economic opportunity --a state of low taxes and light regulation --a state that provides sensible incentives to business and industry, but that doesn't give away the store.
And as a result, for two years running, we have set records for attracting new job-creating investment to our state: In 1995, $3.9 billion in new investment; last year, over 4.3 billion dollars.

To make sure our young people are prepared to compete for good jobs, we have formed an exciting public/private partnership to guide our School-to-Work efforts.

I take very seriously the responsibility we have to be good stewards of our states's natural beauty and abundant resources --that's what attracted the pioneers and the settlers and it's what has sustained Tennessee families for 200 years.
If we do our part, it will sustain countless generations of Tennesseans yet to come.
Working together, we have enacted two important legislative packages to fight crime and punish criminals --an effort we continue in this budget with a series of proposals that target and punish violent juvenile offenders, but that also sensibly invest in preventive measures for kids in crisis, for kids at-risk, for kids who have been pressured or lured into danger and trouble.
These are the priorities we've chosen together with our citizens and taxpayers --and we've chosen well.

It is in that spirit that I present to you our budget and governing blueprint for fiscal 1997-98.
In many respects this is the toughest budget our state has faced in the last 5 years and the toughest we are likely to face in the next five.
We propose a budget of $14 billion, 419 million -- $110 million less than last year.
Balancing the budget in a time of tight revenues requires some choices: We can delay or defer our new investments in education and health care and Families First and juvenile justice --but that would be short-sighted and it would short-change our children's future.
We could raise taxes, but that would dampen the fires of enterprise and investment and job-creation that provide economic opportunity for Tennesseans --and the lost economic activity that results would offset much of the revenue we stand to gain.
That's a bad deal for our citizens, and I've ruled it out.
Low taxes are an advantage not to be squandered or lightly bartered away.
What's required of us is no different than what's required and expected of businesses and of working families --live within our means; make sure that overall state spending does not grow more quickly than the revenues we collect.
That's the third option --the one I've chosen as the basis for our budget.
We will fund our future by finding sensible, strategic savings elsewhere in state government.
We will reclaim $131 million in reserves and transfers.
But we will leave the Rainy Day fund untouched.
We will reduce the base budget for higher education by 4%, an amount we've arrived at in discussion with the UT system and the Board of Regents.
We hope to minimize the impact these cuts will have on teaching and basic research, and we intend to more than make up for it when the Council for Excellence in Higher Education completes its work.
We will make a $50 million cut in the base budget of the executive branch of government.
This will require the elimination of 1753 positions, one thousand of which we've already eliminated through attrition.
I want to be fair to those affected by these necessary reductions.
I'm sensitive to the needs of the individuals and families involved.
We are going out of our way to provide fair notice and transitional assistance, 4 to 6 months worth based on length of service.
That is reasonable and responsible by any standard applied to the public or private sector.
These are sensible reductions in spending and personnel, consistent with our efforts to operate government more efficiently and to redirect our resources to where they will do the most good for our citizens.
Our twin objectives are to have a state government that's the right size and that's focused on the right things.
Our budget invests $390 million in new spending, over 90% of it is devoted to areas important to the current and future well-being of our children: education, health care, Families First, children's services and Criminal Justice.
We are fully funding the 6th and final installment of the Basic Education Program --an increase of $192 million.
That brings our total budget for K-12 education to $2 billion, 154 million -- about a billion dollars more than when the BEP began.
That's a lot money.
Let me help put it in perspective.
For one million dollars we can: hire 33 new teachers and further reduce pupil/teacher ratios; or hire 92 educational assistants, freeing teachers from tasks that keep them from teaching; Or we can: equip 71 21st Century Classrooms; or purchase 40 thousand new textbooks.
A million dollars would allow a fast-growing school district to : build and equip 14 new classrooms; or buy 20 new school buses.
We're investing an additional $192 million in our children's education, and it will make a difference.
Part of those funds will pay for education technology.
By the time school lets out for the summer, our ConnecTen project will have linked every public school in the state to the Internet.
And no state has done what we've done in giving every school the capability of logging-on to the information superhighway --not just with one computer --but with an entire network.
By the end of next school year, every single classroom will be wired, making Tennessee the first state in the union to meet the President's challenge.
But providing the technology is not enough; our children must be able to master it.
So we have set a goal that each child will be able to access the world's libraries and data bases a minimum of three hours per week.
This means we will be working with every teacher and every school.
It is the teachers --not the technology --who teach and guide our children, and they'll need our help and support to share these new opportunities with their students.
Our budget invests an additional $116 million in TennCare.
Among other improvements, that investment will allow us to honor our commitment to care for those with mental illness.
And it will enable us to offer basic health insurance protection to every uninsured child in our state.
We're the first state to do that.
68,000 young Tennesseans lack insurance protection tonight.
We can help assure that they get a healthy start in life, and we can help their parents rest easier at night, knowing that a child's illness need not become a family's financial ruin.
A year ago, I urged you to replace welfare with Families First.
You did; and frankly, it is a better program because of your amendments.
In the end, Families First passed with only 3 dissenting votes, and I cannot remember when state government made a more dynamic change with such broad and bipartisan support.
The program's early success indicates that we did the right thing in offering welfare families a chance, instead of just a check.
Tonight, I ask you to join me in making good on the commitment we made last year.
Remember, Families First is an agreement we've made with those on welfare.
We promised that if they worked toward self-sufficiency, we would help them --with child care, with transportation, with job training and placement.
This year, that requires an additional $22 million, including $10 million to increase the state's reimbursement rate to centers that care for the children of Families First clients.
In every budget I have presented, I have asked the General Assembly to support our efforts to fight crime and punish criminals.
It is a fight you have joined and made your own.
Tonight, I ask your support for a series of measures targeting juvenile crime.
I know that fighting and preventing juvenile crime is a priority with many of you; several representatives and senators have sponsored legislation about it.
I'm glad to see it.
I think this is another issue on which we can forge a bipartisan consensus.
I have directed my legislative staff to begin contacting bill sponsors tomorrow morning to find out how we can work together to combine the best of our ideas.
We've approached this from two fronts.
One track is prevention and early intervention; in other words, doing more to keep kids from getting into trouble in the first place.
The second track is for juveniles who, sadly, by the nature of their crimes and their cold-blooded disregard for life, aren't children anymore.
They need to be punished.
And for society's protection, they need to be imprisoned --not with adult offenders, and not with kids who've made mistakes --but in a separate and secure facility of their own.
Our budget provides four million dollars for that purpose.
We also need to pay attention to the growing threat that gangs pose to our children and to our neighborhoods.
I ask you to pass the Criminal Gang Act of 1997 and make it easier for police and prosecutors to put gangs out of business.
On the prevention side, we will initiate gang education programs to help young people avoid and resist the pressures to join them.
We're going to continue with the Governor's Prevention Initiative, a grant program that supports community-based efforts to discourage teen pregnancy and to keep kids in school, out of trouble and off drugs.
It touches 67,000 boys and girls in 20 counties through programs like Children & Family Services in Covington, Kids on the Block of Middle Tennessee, and Holston United Methodist Home for Children.
We also plan to establish academies, where we can continue to guide and educate boys and girls who have caused enough trouble to be kicked-out of school, but not enough to sent to the state's custody.
Those young lives are truly in the balance, and the scales could tip either way, depending on who reaches out to help them.
The proposals I've presented to you this evening build on the priorities we've established together.
They are priorities we've developed in conversation with our citizens --with parents and teachers, with those who operate child care centers and who intervene in a child's moment of crisis, with doctors and nurses, with judges and police officers and members of the clergy.
"People like: Ann McGintis, the Director of Chattanooga Family Resource Centers, where she has demonstrated that through prevention and early intervention it is possible to stabilize the ""at-risk"" child's environment and improve the child's educational potential."
Dr. Kenneth Dodge, Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, who has studied children's development for 20 years --with a particular interest in how chronic violent behavior develops and how it can be prevented.
He has created a program called FAST Track to prevent chronic violence in high-risk children.
Don McGehee, a former Marine who has served as a state director of pardon and parole, who does volunteer work in our public schools.
"His ""I Am Somebody "" program is designed to enhance children's self-esteem and help them to make better choices."
Across our state there are literally thousands of people like Ann McGintis and Kenneth Dodge and Don McGehee, who have taken it upon themselves to get involved in the lives of our children.
They have insight and ideas we need to hear.
And so as I travel our state, I'm going to continue our conversation with Tennesseans about children's future.
But one point is fairly clear.
Government can help, but only to a point.
Because the values important to any decent society and the basic lessons of right and wrong are learned at home from parents and families.
At best, we can hope to be of help to children in distress and in danger, and we can take pains to assure that government's work reinforces the family's own.
"And each of us, in our own lives, can be mindful of the children around us and of what William Bennett has called ""the moral power of quiet example."
Ina Hughes is a wonderful columnist for the Knoxville News-Sentinel and the author of one the most acclaimed poems of our time: A Prayer for Children.
Let me share part of it with you: We pray for children who spend all their allowance before Thursday, who throw tantrums in the grocery store and pick at their food, who like ghost stories.
And we pray for those whose nightmares come in the daytime who will eat anything who aren't spoiled by anybody who go to bed hungry and cry themselves to sleep.
We pray for children Who want to be carried and for those who must.
For those we never give up on, and for those who don't get a chance.
For those we smother, and for those who will grab the hand of anybody kind enough to offer.
My friends, let us extend that hand.
Together, let us work to make Tennessee a place of opportunity for all of our children.
