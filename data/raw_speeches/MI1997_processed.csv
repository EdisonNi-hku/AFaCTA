SENTENCES
"Majority Leader Posthumus, Speaker Hertel, colleagues in government, citizens of Michigan: I stand here tonight at the midpoint of my term, proud of what we have accomplished, optimistic about what we will do together."
"I am proud to report to the people of Michigan that in terms of reform and results, the last legislative session is unmatched in state history."
"Thus, the state of our state is better than ever."
For it has been a quarter century since welfare was needed by so few .
. . a quarter century since the rate of violent crime was down so far .
. . and a quarter century since unemployment was so low.
"My friends, America knows that Michigan is back as a state of basic values, big ideas, and bold leadership."
"State after state is copying Michigan -- reforming school funding, reorganizing government and reducing taxes."
"We have strengthened Michigan's foundation -- now, our greatest challenge is to secure Michigan's future for our families."
"Securing our future means making sure that our children have every chance to be safe, smart and successful."
"Over the past six years, we have taken many steps that are making a difference for Michigan's families.We are on the right course.We will not turn back.We must forge ahead."
We must forge ahead so every child can attend a high quality school .
. . so every child is protected from violence and abuse .
. . so every worker has the skills to compete and succeed .
. . so every family is safe in their homes and neighborhoods .
. . and so every generation to come is assured a Michigan as beautiful and bountiful as the Michigan we enjoy today.
"Our families, our future -- let those words be our inspiration as we work together -- today, tomorrow, forever."
"IMPROVING OUR SCHOOLS My fellow citizens, nothing is more important to the future of families than the quality of our children's education."
Education is the ladder from poverty to prosperity.
Education makes equal opportunity possible.
Education is the key to the American dream.
"And it is the lack of education, or poor quality education, that too often makes welfare and prisons necessary."
Let me tell you where Michigan stands when it comes to public education.
We know firsthand that some of our public schools and many of our teachers are the very best in the world.
But we also know that too many schools are failing our children and that some teachers feel threatened in their own classrooms.
We know that Michigan students score above average on national tests.
But we also know that we can do better and our children deserve better.
We know that parental involvement is the key to student success.
But we also know that too many parents feel shut out and ignored.
"In particular, less than one-third of African-American families give their local schools high marks."
"We know that Michigan spends $11 billion a year on public education, that spending on our schools has quadrupled over the past 20 years and that we are more generous with our schools than 42 other states."
But we also know that money alone does not raise student performance.
"We know that Proposal A has dramatically increased equity in school funding, and that next year, for the first time, every school district will receive more than $5,000 per pupil."
But we also know that the performance gap between urban and non-urban districts is intolerable.
"In addition to knowing where Michigan stands, it is important for you to know where I stand as governor.I am for public education."
Being for public education has meant increasing funding for public schools 25 percent in just five years.
"Being for public education means that in the 1998 general fund budget I will send you next week, school spending, for the first time, will amount to more than everything else combined -- more than prisons, police, agriculture, courts -- everything else combined."
Being for public education means giving our 1.6 million students and their parents and teachers more quality school choices.
"Today, with 77 charter public schools and more than two hundred school districts participating in our landmark school choice program, Michigan is a national leader."
I am pleased to announce that the National Conference on Quality in Education has accepted my invitation to come to Dearborn this November.
"As a result, Michigan will have a chance to show America what we're doing and learn lessons from our sister states."
Being for public education means backing President Clinton's call for more charter schools.
"Last week, the President announced the doubling of federal support for charter schools."
I propose that Michigan be the first state to take advantage of this national public school initiative.
"Further, I invite members of the president's own party in this legislature to join us as partners in opening the doors to more charter public schools.Let's work together!"
"Being for public education means holding all of our schools accountable -- accountable to parents, to employers and to taxpayers."
Being for public education means insisting on high standards and rigorous tests to measure our progress.
"Being for public education means empowering teachers, defending local control and disclosing to parents how their schools measure up -- with other area schools, with schools statewide, nationwide, worldwide."
"Being for public education means making sure that every school, every classroom, every teacher, every student is safe."
Being for public education means keeping education our top priority!
One key to quality education is quality teachers.
"Proud, passionate -- these professional men and women are making a difference in the lives of students every day."
That's why I was outraged to read in the Detroit News that in one high school this year nine teachers have been assaulted.
"When teachers are attacked in their own classrooms, academic performance is also a casualty."
"I may be old fashioned, but it seems to me, if a student lays a hand on a teacher, that student is gone."
"If a basketball player pushes a referee, that player is out of the game."
"If a student assaults a teacher, that student should be out of the school."
We've already taken a successful step forward by expelling students who bring weapons to school.
"As a result, we're moving bad kids out of class and helping good kids move to the head of the class."
Now it's time for the next step.
I am proposing the immediate expulsion of any student who assaults a teacher.
"This legislation will be sponsored by Senator Leon Stille and Representative Jessie Dalman and will also protect bus drivers, security personnel and all other school employees as well.Let's do the right thing."
Let's stand up for our teachers and kids who play by the rules.
Let's pass this bill in 30 days.
"Further, I invite the leadership of the Michigan Federation of Teachers and the Michigan Education Association to join with us in developing and passing this legislation."
"I have just stressed the importance of protecting teachers from bad kids who disrupt their classrooms, but what should we do when the school is bad?"
"For too long, the reaction has been: ""It's somebody else's school.It's somebody else's problem."
It may be somebody else's school but it is our problem.
"If I told you that 99 percent of the 11th-graders in one southwest Michigan school district failed their state proficiency test in science and that 95 percent of the 11th-graders in our largest school district failed their science test, you would say: ""That's an outrage -- something must be done.I agree."
"We must act to help the children in Benton Harbor, in Detroit and in other failing school districts."
"Last week, Detroit School Board member Dr. Margaret Betts said, ""We need help."
"We're educating some kids, but we're losing too many.She's right."
It's time we stand shoulder to shoulder to help these kids.
"My friends, how in good conscience can we look the other way when thousands of children trapped in failing public schools have no other choice and no other chance?"
"Already, the state can hold school districts accountable when they fail to meet strict financial standards."
"However, nothing happens when school districts fail year after year to meet even minimal performance standards."
"To me, a system of accountability that focuses only on dollars and cents makes no sense and shortchanges our children.We have no choice.We must change the system!"
"So to help our children, I propose the School District Accountability Act to be sponsored by one of Michigan's most able advocates for school reform and a public school parent himself -- Senator Dan DeGrow."
"This new Accountability Act would allow state intervention in any school district if either of the following minimal standards is not met: first, when more than 80 percent of the students fail the state proficiency test; second, when the dropout rate is higher than 25 percent."
"In addition, I support authorizing the State Board of Education to establish other criteria that would allow for state intervention."
I realize that some will recoil at the thought of state intervention.
They will argue that local control means they should be in charge.
"As I said earlier, I defend local control, but I cannot defend failure."
The standards that will trigger state intervention -- 80 percent failing or 25 percent dropping out -- are proof that something is seriously wrong and we cannot sit by and ignore the problems in the name of local control.
"No one -- no one in this room, no one in this state -- can stand up and defend a school district that fails 80 percent of our kids."
"Make no mistake about it -- I will not, and this legislature should not, turn away from children in need."
We must act to put the children first and fix their schools.
"All of us took an oath to uphold Michigan's Constitution which says, ""."
. . schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.
Let's stand by that oath and do what it takes to educate our children.
"REFORMING WELFARE AND PROTECTING CHILDREN Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing what it takes to break the cycle of dependency."
"As families go to work and incomes rise, welfare reform in Michigan continues to be a national model."
"The key to our success has been a requirement that all families work, and that policy will continue."
Welfare caseloads have dropped by more than one-quarter over the last three years.
"In Project Zero test areas, the number of families without income from employment dropped by more than one-quarter in just three months!"
"Now, more than half of all Project Zero participants are working and earning a paycheck."
"For Family Independence Agency social workers like Ann Hunt, who are now making housecalls to work with their clients, satisfaction from beating paperwork deadlines is being replaced by satisfaction at seeing families achieve success."
"Tonight, I propose we build on the success of Project Zero -- our full employment initiative which I announced last year."
We will double this program and continue to move social workers into the community and welfare recipients into the workforce.
We reform welfare not just because it gives parents a helping hand to independence but because it gives children a helping hand to a better future.
"Children -- their health, safety, education and quality of life -- have been our priority from day one."
"I am proud of our accomplishments: the number of adoptions -- doubled; the number of abortions -- down; more than 100,000 welfare families -- independent; teen pregnancy -- down; infant mortality -- at a record low; immunization rate -- up dramatically; health insurance for kids -- top ten in the nation; welfare families working -- more than 30 percent statewide; and, number of child deaths -- down by 25 percent."
These accomplishments are making a difference in the lives of many Michigan families and improving the prospects for many Michigan children.
"While fewer children are threatened by poverty and illness, unfortunately, too many children are threatened by adults, sometimes their own parents."
There is no excuse for child abuse.
Every child deserves a chance at childhood.
"No one in Michigan has worked harder for reform than our Lt. Governor, Connie Binsfeld."
"Last year, Connie chaired a special Children's Commission to recommend ways to make Michigan a better place for children to live and to be loved."
"It is Connie's dream and mission for every child to find what she most appropriately calls ""a forever family."
Connie is not alone in caring for Michigan's children.
There are hundreds of committed caseworkers and thousands of foster and adoptive parents who want nothing more than for each child in their care to find and keep that forever family.
"Like the elderly couple who, since 1991, has found homes for 19 children, including four sets of brothers and sisters and two teenagers with special needs."
"While we have already begun to implement key recommendations of the report, tonight I am pleased to announce even more progress: First, we seek to change both state and federal laws to allow protective service workers access to information necessary to safeguard children from exposure to hazards like drug abuse or criminal behavior."
"At the same time, the FIA director should also be given the authority to release information to the public when it is in the best interest of the child."
"Second, we will undertake a new, coordinated campaign to recruit adoptive families and to raise public awareness about the benefits of adoption."
"Third, to strengthen accountability, the state will publish an annual report card for each agency and court, including each county FIA office regarding their performance in finding permanent homes for children."
We will also continue to press all public and private agencies to shorten the time it takes to find permanent homes.
"Fourth, to assure appropriate and consistent medical treatment, a medical passport, including immunization records, will be developed and implemented for children in foster care."
"And finally, in cases where abuse ends the life of a child, special review teams will investigate in order to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."
Our children's agenda has saved lives.
"Now, more children will get a chance at childhood."
"As we're working to save the lives of children, medical research is telling us more about the basic building blocks of life itself."
"Scientists around the world, including top-notch researchers at the University of Michigan, are creating an incredibly detailed map of our genetic information."
"Already, the genetic bases for more than 4,000 diseases have been identified, and new genes are being discovered at a rate of two per week."
"My friends, this research creates an unbelievably exciting potential to prevent, delay or minimize disease that is absolutely unprecedented in human history."
"As the University of Michigan's Dr. Francis Collins, one of world's leading genetic researchers, has said: ""This information carries the potential to do enormous good for people, in terms of reducing illness and suffering."
Yet I am deeply concerned that this information can also be turned around to be used against people.
"To safeguard that information and to develop a model state policy regarding the use of genetic information, I will soon appoint a Governor's Commission on Genetic Privacy and Progress to recommend ways to protect genetic privacy, prevent discrimination and maximize the beneficial uses of new medical knowledge."
"If we are prepared to act now, we will not be forced to react in the future."
CREATING JOBS AND TRAINING WORKERS One area where we have acted decisively is in revitalizing Michigan's economy and helping families provide for their children.
"Michigan's economic renaissance has proven that to create better jobs, raise take-home pay and strengthen families -- cut taxes, cut taxes, cut taxes."
"To build on our record, tonight I am announcing tax cuts of $350 million over the next two years."
The good news is you don't have to pass any bills.
These tax cuts are already law and will be phased in this year and next.
There's more good news: 21 tax cuts have already saved taxpayers more than $6.5 billion.
$1.1 billion is on deposit in our Rainy Day Fund.
The nation's only tax-free Renaissance Zones are up and running.
Michigan has America's best record of creating manufacturing jobs.
Income growth in Michigan since 1990 has been the fastest in the entire nation -- up more than 25 percent.
And unemployment is at the lowest level since 1969 -- when man first walked on the moon.
Cutting taxes and controlling state spending have contributed to economic conditions that are the best in three decades.
"Since we began working together to launch our ""Taxpayer's Agenda,"" more than 500,000 Michigan men and women have found new jobs."
"Take a look at Sunday's ""Employment"" section of the paper -- 24 pages of opportunities."
"In fact, we have so many good jobs, we can't fill them fast enough."
"The University of Michigan projects that the Big Three will hire well over 100,000 new workers right here in Michigan over the next five years."
High-paying jobs like these are the backbone of Michigan's economy -- bread and butter jobs for Michigan's families.
"These jobs range from work our grandparents might have done -- as carpenters, bricklayers and electricians -- to jobs our grandparents never imagined, involving computers, robots and lasers."
"TIME magazine called these jobs ""gold collar"" since they can pay as much as $30 to $40 an hour."
"Interestingly, most of these gold collar jobs don't require a four-year college degree."
"What they do require is extensive training, especially work-based education."
"In fact, better than seven out of ten jobs in America today don't need a college degree."
But more and more high school graduates are attending college -- about two out of three do enroll in a college program.
Only about half ever earn a degree.
"For students who don't go to college or decide that college isn't right for them, there aren't enough choices and opportunities."
"For too long, these young people -- who want a good job in a career that has a future -- have been forgotten and left behind."
"Tonight, I am taking two actions to insure they won't be forgotten anymore."
"First, an executive order based on the excellent work done by Representative Glenn Oxender to establish a statewide framework for career preparation."
"Second, legislation to fund a career preparation system based on high standards with maximum local collaboration so the training fits the jobs."
"In addition, I will recommend a $30 million increase to reward schools that take up this challenge."
A successful partnership that is paving the way is the Kent Advanced Manufacturing Academy in Grand Rapids.
This school responds to the need for world-class employees in manufacturing by bringing together local employers and the community college in a program for high school students that integrates academic and technical instruction with work-place training.
"Beyond the two concrete steps I just mentioned, we must also take a step forward in changing attitudes as well."
"First, the words ""vocational education"" must vanish from our vocabulary."
Those words reflect a system and a mindset that don't get the job done today and won't fit in the 21st century.
"Instead, we must focus on ""career preparation"" and teaching our children that success in a career means learning must never stop."
"Working together, employers and educators will develop regional career preparation plans and a curriculum that integrates academic and technical skills, including worksite learning and employment for graduates."
It is no longer good enough for a high school to simply have a shop program or a career day.
"In this era of high tech and high skills, we must create new options for all students, especially those who are not college bound."
"Our initiative involves a new kind of school -- the Advanced Career Academy -- 21st century joint ventures between education and business that will deliver targeted, high-skill, high-wage technical and academic skills to high school students."
"The keys to the success of this strategy are: first, new partnerships with employers and educators; second, dramatic changes in attitudes; and third, an unprecedented commitment to elevate career prep to the same plane as college prep so that no one is left behind.Make no mistake about it."
This proposal cannot become a partisan issue.
It is just too important to the future of our children and the future of Michigan's economy.
"The Council on Competitiveness, a national non-partisan group of leaders from business, labor and education, recently released their assessment of America's competitive position over the last decade and set forth a prescription for the future.Here's what they said: "".. ."
The education and skill levels of [our] workforce will be the most serious competitiveness hurdle that the United States will face over the next decade.
"My friends, the only way we can help Michigan over that hurdle is by working together."
Getting over that hurdle and preparing our workers for the 21st century also means making sure our students have access to the best and most powerful education resources in the world.
More than 98% of Michigan's K-12 students have some level of Internet access in their schools.
"Our libraries, community colleges and institutions of higher education are all investing in advanced telecommunication technologies to link information users with information sources in the blink of an eye."
I am committed to encouraging the development of learning applications to reach the global resources that are just a keystroke and a modem away from our desktop computers.
"We must also generate awareness about these new applications and expand teacher training to ensure that ""access"" translates into improved learning and superior performance for students of all ages."
"To that end, this session, I will send you a message on technology that builds on the solid framework already in place and puts Michigan on the cutting edge -- of learning, teaching, communicating and advancing the frontiers of knowledge."
"BUILDING AND FIXING ROADS Just as a new strategy is important for preparing our workers, a new strategy is important for repairing our infrastructure."
"Since 1991, our Build Michigan program has rebuilt, repaired and resurfaced more roads and bridges than in any comparable period in state history."
"Look at the accomplishments: In Macomb County, M59 -- delayed more than 20 years, will be completed next year."
"In Oakland County, the Haggerty Connector -- 15 years on the drawing board -- now meeting the needs of one of Michigan's fastest growing counties."
"In Wayne County, the Davison Freeway -- a local highway with no hope of repair -- now a state priority being completely rebuilt."
"In mid-Michigan, US-27 -- a project talked about since the early 70s -- is now getting done."
And in west Michigan -- M37 in Grand Rapids and the 9th Street Bridge in Kalamazoo -- two more examples of our commitment to Michigan roads.
"1,000 miles of highways were improved each year -- double the previous goal."
"Funding to repair bridges was increased by 350 percent, including the inspection and evaluation of all 4,900 Michigan bridges."
Some 200 bridges found in critical need of repair have already been rebuilt.
"And while the state was busy building roads and fixing problems all across Michigan, we increased local transportation funding by 25 percent."
"Build Michigan accomplished all this, and much more, without raising the fuel tax one penny."
But there's more to building highways than concrete and asphalt.
And what we accomplished transforming the Michigan Department of Transportation into a more efficient agency is another success story that must be told.
"MDOT has taken aggressive steps to streamline operations and trim 600 employees, raising an extra $100 million over the past six years to fix our roads."
"But despite all we have done, I remain concerned about the state of Michigan's roads."
"Frequently, I am asked: When is the legislature going to raise fuel taxes to fix our roads?"
"I believe before fuel taxes are raised, we must exhaust every alternative, lower costs as much as possible and enact every possible reform."
I am not satisfied that we have done our utmost.
"So tonight, I am not recommending that this legislature raise fuel taxes."
"Instead, I propose a specific, seven-point plan to fix more of our roads: ONE."
I ask you to act promptly to approve $70 million in additional money for the 1997 roadbuilding season.
This action will make approximately $40 million available for local projects and $30 million for state highway projects.
"As a result, state construction will begin on the South Beltline project in Kent County and the connection of I-75 to the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.TWO."
"For the 1998 roadbuilding season, I am recommending $110 million for bridge repair and $180 million for highway and bridge maintenance.THREE."
I renew my call to stop frivolous and outrageous lawsuits -- a reform that will yield as much as $15 million to $25 million a year to fix our roads.
I commend the Senate for passing this much-needed reform in the last session.FOUR.
"I renew my call to eliminate the outdated and unnecessary ""spillage allowance."
This reform would mean another $15 million annually to fix our roads.FIVE.
We will continue our drive to reduce the cost of operating MDOT.
"By next year, compared to when I took office, the department will be smaller by nearly 1,000 employees."
"At the same time, duplicative facilities will be closed, freeing up millions of dollars to fix our roads."
Every additional dollar in administrative savings is an additional dollar for road repair.SIX.
"At a time when state government is making every effort to increase efficiency and reduce costs, taxpayers have a right to expect that county road commissions and other local governments, who receive 60 cents of every fuel tax dollar, are making every effort as well."
"Because some local road agencies are fighting to keep the auditor general out and their books secret, tonight I propose that you pass legislation making it clear the secrecy will stop.Our state books are open."
Local books should be open as well.
"In addition, the basic formula that allocates gas tax revenue among the state, counties and local governments expires next year."
I will appoint a task force to review this 40-year-old formula and recommend necessary updates.SEVEN.
"I realize that some will say that even if you do all these things -- cut costs, exhaust alternatives, enact every reform possible, and add new money -- it's still not enough and we need to raise taxes."
"To tax advocates, I have a question: What about the taxes we already pay to Washington -- where so many of our tax dollars go and so few come back?"
"I agree with Senator Don Koivisto when he said, and I quote: ""I'd really like Michigan to receive a greater share of our federal tax dollars for transportation."
"For every $1.00 we send to Washington, we get 85 cents in return. . . ."
I propose that we launch a bipartisan congressional initiative to persuade the Administration and Congress that Michigan should get its fair share.
Success in Washington could mean bringing back home more than $200 million of Michigan's money to fix Michigan's roads.
"Perhaps the best solution is legislation being developed by Congressmen John Kasich of Ohio and Nick Smith of Michigan and Senator Spencer Abraham to transfer the authority over the interstate highway system, along with all federal taxes, to the states."
This seven-point plan is the equivalent of a six to eight cent hike in the fuel tax.
"I realize raising taxes would be easy for some, but in this case, the tough choices are the right choices."
There's one other issue being debated in Washington that deserves mention -- the Balanced Budget Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.
I support the Balanced Budget Amendment and so do Michigan voters.
"When Congress takes up this historic amendment next month, I urge them to pass it and submit it to the states."
"I invite this legislature to join the debate, call upon your colleagues in Congress to act and help the federal budget look more like Michigan's budget -- balanced."
Wouldn't it be a proud moment for Michigan to be one of the first states to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment?
"I know I would be proud to tell my children that, in 1997, we had the courage to stop mortgaging their future."
"FIGHTING CRIME AND PROTECTING FAMILIES While rebuilding roads and balancing the federal budget are important, rebuilding safe communities is even more important."
That's why fighting crime continues to be a top priority.
"Our crime-fighting strategy has been simple and to-the-point -- new tools for police and prosecutors, tougher penalties for violent, habitual lawbreakers and probation, prison and parole reforms to protect the public."
"As a result, the rate of violent crime in Michigan is down -- down four years in a row to the lowest level in 25 years."
"Last year, compared to five years ago, 100,000 fewer serious crimes were reported in Michigan."
"While overall crime rates are down, Michigan is now tackling one of the nation's most serious crime problems -- the rise in violent juvenile crime."
"In 1996, after a four-year battle, we enacted the toughest juvenile crime package in the nation."
"Now, juveniles who commit adult crime will do adult time."
"These violent young felons will do their time under watchful eyes, not of social workers, but prison guards."
"My fellow citizens, my commitment to your safety begins with my responsibility to back Michigan's law enforcement community with the resources and support to get the job done."
"For example, we have increased the number of state troopers patrolling Michigan's streets and highways to an all-time high."
We're arming law enforcement with the most modern and sophisticated communication and forensic technology to identify and apprehend dangerous criminals.
"In a few days, I'll be demonstrating the first phase of our new public safety communications system which you approved."
"When complete, our public safety professionals will gain an awesome new advantage in their fight against crime as well as a better ability to respond to emergencies."
The public has gained a new tool as well -- the right to know -- thanks to recent legislation making Michigan's sexual offender registry open to the public.
"I know that some in this legislature opposed this action, saying we were being vindictive with criminals."
"For demanding justice, I make no apologies."
"Since taking office, I have signed more than 300 bills to reform, strengthen and improve Michigan's criminal justice system."
"The result -- prosecutors are already using new laws to dismantle gangs, take apart drug cartels and ship to prison the predators who victimize our children and families."
"But despite all that, despite our get-tough approach, despite the new prison beds, despite all the work we have done to bring down the rate of violent crime, what do you see each night on the local news but murder and mayhem?"
That means our job is not done.
We will be making progress when the first story on the evening news is about lives saved by people who care and not about lives lost to crime and drugs.
"This session, I urge you to continue to make fighting crime a priority."
"Together, let's build upon what we have accomplished, keep our strategy consistent and strengthen our message to those who might break the law."
"With the invaluable help of police and prosecutors, I have developed a detailed plan of action with some 50 initiatives to make Michigan even safer."
"These include: First, to toughen our sex offender registry statute, I propose that sex offenders on parole or probation from other states who move to Michigan must be required to provide our state police with a sample of their DNA -- their genetic fingerprint."
"Second, I am recommending legislation that prohibits those convicted of a criminal sexual conduct offense from being employed by child care centers or in other jobs that involve the supervision of children."
"Third, we will build on last year's landmark juvenile justice reform package."
"For example, I propose that we assure that all prior juvenile convictions are considered when charging or sentencing any adult."
"Fourth, we will target newly available federal resources to expand funding for community groups and shelters that help domestic violence victims, and we will seek legislation to give domestic violence cases priority in our court system."
Another highlight of our anti-crime package would protect the public from dangerous drivers with suspended or revoked licenses.
Here's the driving record of the drunk driver who veered across the center line of Cherry Hill Road and killed Judy Rosin of Canton Township -- just a week after her 17th birthday.
"This unlicensed driver had been cited four times for alcohol-related violations, had received 11 tickets for driving with a suspended license and had been cited 14 times for unpaid tickets."
He had been banned from driving until the year 2002.
The death of Judy Rosin is a tragedy repeated far too often on Michigan roadways.
"Tonight, I urge you to join me in saying enough is enough."
Secretary of State Candice Miller and I will soon recommend legislation designed to punish repeat traffic offenders -- especially drunk drivers -- and hold them strictly accountable for their crimes.
We will make it clear that a license to drive is a privilege and is not a guarantee of a second chance.
"Judy Rosin didn't get a second chance, and in the future, dangerous drivers shouldn't either."
"This plan features a progressive series of tough sanctions for repeat offenders, including bright red license plates, confiscation of plates, the ""boot"" to immobilize vehicles and ultimately, vehicle forfeiture."
My anti-crime plan also targets substance abuse.
"Communities, schools and parents need our support in all their efforts to protect children from the menace of substance abuse."
"The new director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control Policy, Darnell Jackson, has been very clear on this issue, and so am I."
"When it comes to drugs, we have zero tolerance."
"Our message is blunt and unmistakable: ""No Use -- No Excuse."
I am pleased to announce that Michigan broadcasters will join with our drug control office to spearhead a Partnership for a Drug Free Michigan.
"With our partners in the media, we will reinforce the message that drug use is not only harmful, it is wrong."
"In addition, I propose a comprehensive safe schools initiative, including a requirement that school officials report serious crimes that occur on school property."
"I also think that when drugs are found on school property, local police must be notified, and when juveniles are convicted of serious crimes, the court should tell school officials."
"Further, disciplinary records should follow students who change schools, and schools should have access to the juvenile records of students who have broken the law."
"At the same time, schools should be permitted to honor the suspensions and expulsions of students by other schools."
"These measures, and the earlier proposals regarding teacher safety, all have as their purpose the restoration of a safe, disciplined learning environment in our public schools."
"Last year, President Clinton defended the right of public schools to require uniforms."
"I propose we make it clear that Michigan schools can, if they wish, require school uniforms for any or all of their students."
"Finally, as we talk about important priorities, let me say this about state oversight of casinos."
"With the passage of Proposal E last year, the state now has the responsibility to license and regulate three casinos in Detroit."
"I take this responsibility very seriously, and I am very concerned that Michigan's initiated law is far weaker than comparable laws across the country."
Attorney General Kelley and I will continue to be aggressive in developing and promoting legislation to fight corruption and assure fairness and integrity in Michigan casinos.
"Some say crime, corruption and casinos go hand in hand."
"If General Kelley and I have anything to say about it, Michigan will stand for nothing less than the highest ethical standards."
NATURAL RESOURCES STEWARDSHIP One of the things I am proudest of is our successful record as steward of Michigan's natural resources -- from our majestic forests to our Great Lakes.
I'm pleased to note that the incredible resources of Michigan's Upper Peninsula will be on display at the World Winter Cities forum in Marquette next month -- the first time this conference has been held in the continental United States.
"My friends, it is up to us to make sure that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the natural beauty and splendor unique to Michigan."
"In particular, hunting and fishing are family traditions we must always defend and protect."
"That's why I am pleased to report that in Michigan, it is now a crime to harass law-abiding citizens who are exercising their right to hunt and fish and enjoy the great outdoors."
"As governor, I believe natural resource management is one of the most important functions of state government."
"Our approach, based on sound science, relative risk and pollution prevention, is working."
The proof: Michigan's air and water are cleaner than at any time since monitoring began.
"When it comes to protecting the Great Lakes, I was proud to solve a long running problem by signing an historic agreement to stop the excessive diversion of water from Lake Michigan by the city of Chicago."
And the Office of the Great Lakes is moving forward with a plan to address the most serious threat facing our lakes today -- the invasion of harmful foreign species.
"Certainly, with 3,000 miles of coastline, Michigan is a state known for its freshwater resources."
"Our strategy to protect water resources, watershed by watershed, is leading the nation."
"We are reducing discharges, whether the source be municipal or industrial, residential or runoff."
"And to help local communities reach even higher levels of water quality, I am pleased to announce that a total of $75 million in federal and state funds will be available this year."
"From Lake St. Clair to our inland lakes and streams, I am committed to building strong local-state partnerships to solve problems and keep our water clean."
"Not long ago, 23 areas in Michigan were out of compliance with federal Clean Air Act requirements."
"Today, our success is reflected in the fact that virtually the entire state is in compliance."
Common-sense reforms are helping us clean up more toxic sites than ever before.
"Tonight, because of these reforms, I am pleased to announce the Department of Environmental Quality will have an additional $20 million to clean up even more sites this year."
"These landmark reforms, supported by urban mayors from Detroit to Grand Rapids, have led to unprecedented clean-up and redevelopment."
"The benefits: private investment of $230 million to rehabilitate polluted and abandoned factory sites, resulting in the creation of more than 2,300 new jobs."
Our strategy to redevelop urban land required striking an appropriate balance.
The debate about protecting natural resources also requires balancing public use with private rights.
Michigan has a long and proud tradition of respecting the constitutional rights of private property owners.
"Article X, Section 2 of our state constitution guarantees, ""."
. . private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation . . . .
I commend Republican Leader Ken Sikkema for his leadership in sponsoring the Property Rights Preservation Act.
This legislation begins a process to resolve conflicts between private property owners and the interests of the state and the public.
I believe the next step should be for the Natural Resources Trust Fund board to explore using its full constitutional authority to acquire development rights.
Another possible option to resolve conflicts is use of the state's power of eminent domain in extremely limited situations to prevent development.
One example of how this might work is seen in the debate about the pristine Jordan River Valley in northern Michigan.
"If the state acquired the private property interests in this case, there would be no development."
"While I think that government already owns enough land -- one in five acres statewide -- there are very special, irreplaceable, unique areas."
"When they are threatened, we should have the tools to respond."
"Tonight, I have outlined a very ambitious agenda for Michigan: protecting children, strengthening education, standing up for our teachers, safeguarding Michigan's natural resources, fighting crime, fixing our roads and bridges, and training tomorrow's workers."
"This agenda is good for our families, good for our workers and good for our future."
"For six years, we have made great strides in renewing and restoring our great state."
"Now, we have the chance to make Michigan even better."
"Indeed, our challenge is to make Michigan the best in the nation."
"Last November, the voters said: ""Work together.I say to you: ""I am ready!""Let's roll up our sleeves.Let's be bold."
Let's keep Michigan moving forward.
"Thank you, God bless you and good night!"
