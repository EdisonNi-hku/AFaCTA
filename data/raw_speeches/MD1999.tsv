Senate President Mike Miller; Speaker Cas Taylor; Members of the General Assembly; Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend; Attorney General Joe Curran; Comptroller Bobby Swann; Comptroller-elect William Donald Schaefer; Treasurer Richard Dixon; Chief Judge Bob Bell; Secretary of State John Willis; My wife, Frances Anne, our truly gracious and beautiful First Lady; Friends and fellow Marylanders: For the first time in 40 years, a Governor of Maryland begins the State of the State address without recognizing Louis L. Goldstein as Comptroller.
In fact, if you take into account the sixteen years Louis served in the General Assembly, you come to the remarkable realization that Louis was in attendance for more than half the State of the State addresses this Century!
We miss Louie.
We miss his wisdom, his guidance, and his compassion.
We are also grateful for the decades of public service he gave Maryland.
We are confident that Louis' commitment to sound fiscal management and compassionate government have taken such strong roots in Maryland, that he will continue to guide our actions well into the next century.
We are also so pleased his daughter, Louisa, is here.
Today marks the last State of the State address that will be delivered in Maryland this century.
YOU ARE the leadership that will take Maryland into the 21st Century!
For me personally, and for most people everywhere, the onset of a new century is a source of excitement and enthusiasm.
It is an opportunity to reflect upon what we have accomplished together, and to look ahead to the unlimited opportunities-and the significant challenges-we face.
By any measure, we have seen great progress in recent years: Investments in education and student achievement are up; We opened the doors of higher education to more Marylanders; Crime is down--significantly; Our economy is the strongest in a decade; Income taxes were cut for the first time in 30 years; Welfare rolls were reduced by more than half; Our air and water are cleaner and better protected; And we reached out with care and compassion to those less fortunate.
Without a doubt, the State of State is strong.
We are safer.
Our children are healthier.
Our environment is better protected.
And we are more prosperous than we have ever been before.
Thank you Mr. President, and Mr. Speaker, and members of the Legislature for your leadership and hard work.
And--most of all--thanks are due to the hard working men and women of Maryland, whose commitment to family, community, and traditional Maryland values are at the heart of our prosperity!
Together we have done much, but--as I said just yesterday in my inaugural address--we have only just begun.
As noted yesterday, we enter the new century facing several challenges: Helping all our citizens reach their full potential in the knowledge-based economy of the future; Reclaiming our environment for future generations to enjoy; And fostering a true sense of compassion, justice, and equality within our society.
We have an exciting and aggressive agenda that will position Maryland to meet and master those challenges as we move into the 21st century.
We will increase funding for worker training programs, sending a clear signal that Maryland knows that high-tech, high-skilled jobs are a very important part of our future.
We will build upon our Smart Growth / Anti-Sprawl program, protecting farms, fields, rivers and streams, while reinvigorating established neighborhoods.
We will enact a Civil Rights Bill that will strengthen Maryland's anti-discrimination protections for all Marylanders, including those discriminated against because of their choice of sexual partner.
We will move forward with a Patients Bill of Rights that builds upon the patient protections we have already enshrined in law.
We will work to make sure that those with disabilities have the opportunity to meet their full potential.
And we will begin the process of strengthening our gun violence law so that next year we can pass a strong bill that better protects our children and saves lives.
Additionally, we will make sure that our State employees, men and women who work hard, are treated as partners as we serve the people of Maryland: Collective Bargaining is working in Maryland.
It should be the law of the land.
We will also move a number of contractual employees into permanent status.
Think about it for a moment: These are people who work side by side with merit employees, doing the same job, but without receiving health or retirement benefits.
That is unfair and it must be changed.
We will also fight to protect the health of our young people with an increase in the State's tobacco tax.
Studies show that a significant price increase will have a dramatic impact on reducing teen smoking.
This tax increase will not only protect the health of our young people today, but it will also help secure their future.
I propose that a significant portion of the revenue from this tax be used to construct much needed higher education facilities.
For example, with these revenues, we can help the University of Maryland, Baltimore County get their Science and Technology building now, not in the year 2010.
And--as I emphasized yesterday--it is crucial that we protect our environmental infrastructure .
. . our green infrastructure.
Tax dollars will no longer be used to subsidize sprawl.
State funds will only be spent in accordance with Smart Growth guidelines.
These proposals-and others-will position Maryland as a national and world leader for the next century.
Today, however, I will focus almost exclusively on the single most important issue to which we must dedicate ourselves in order to meet our full potential: We must build upon the foundation we have laid, and make--truly make--the education of our children our top priority.
"Education must not be ""a"" priority, it must be ""the"" priority."
The future of our world is fast becoming knowledge based.
And the speed of that transformation is dramatic: A few years ago, advances in biotechnology like cloning and DNA fingerprinting were relegated to science fiction novels.
Today they are scientific fact.
And just earlier this decade, the Internet was primarily the domain of scientists and university researchers.
Today pre-schoolers and senior citizens are learning, shopping, and staying in touch over the World Wide Web.
Nowhere is this emphasis on knowledge more pronounced than in the job market.
A strong back and a solid work ethic no longer guarantee a secure, good-paying job.
Individuals who do not have access to knowledge and skills will find themselves left behind.
"As I said yesterday, it was a shameful time in American history when signs reading ""Irish need not apply,"" ""no Jews,"" ""no Women,"" and ""whites only"" shut out so many Americans and divided us as a nation."
Today we face a different challenge: We must liberate the potential of every individual by full access to knowledge or they will be shut out in the future just as others were in the past.
And our nation will be just as divided.
That is why we must turn our focus squarely to education, both access to education, and quality of education.
We must ensure--no, we must demand--both!
Let me tell you a story about the power of education.
Not too long ago I visited Oak View Elementary School in Montgomery County.
I was there to read to a class of third graders.
After reading I joined the class for lunch.
As we were eating I asked a young African-American student who was sitting across the table from me where he was going after this.
He informed me that he was going to the University of Wisconsin to study Marine Biology!
I told him I was actually asking what middle school he would be attending.
He said he didn't know that .
. . he only knew that he was going to the University of Wisconsin to study Marine Biology!
I want every student in every classroom across Maryland to be that excited about learning!
That is why our agenda touches on the entire spectrum of education in Maryland: From pre-school through 12th grade, through Higher Education, to adult education, re- training and skill enhancement.
Workers need more than one ability or one job for a life-time.
In the 21st century, the greatest skill will be the capacity to acquire new skills.
In the new economy acquiring knowledge will be a life-long journey, not just a destination to be reached.
In order to make this journey successful, we must ensure the best possible beginning.
Mastering the fundamentals of reading and math is critical to success in education.
And it is just common sense that the best way to ensure our children master the basics of reading and math, is to increase the amount of individual attention they receive in these core subjects.
And that is why we will reduce class size for reading in first and second grade and for math in seventh grade.
Our formula for continuing to improve education is simple: More classrooms; Plus additional, qualified, certified teachers; equals smaller class size.
And smaller class size for early reading and math means a better education for every child.
Over the past four years we have built or modernized 6,000 classrooms across Maryland.
We now have the opportunity and the ability to think bigger, reach further and do more!
As we find ourselves at the dawn of a new century, let us also stand at the beginning of the Golden Age of School Construction: We propose to invest $250 million to build and to modernize schools this year, and for each of the following years of this term.
Imagine, $1 billion over the next four years which will enable us to build or modernize 7,500 more classrooms.
With our commitment to add, renovate, and modernize classrooms locked in, we will then provide funding to local communities so they will hire 1,100 additional teachers--over and above normal teacher hirings--for first and second grade reading and seventh grade math classes.
I stress that these new teachers must be certified in their area of instruction.
Remember, our focus is on access and quality.
The modernized classrooms provide the access, but we must ensure the quality of the teachers.
Our children deserve this; their parents demand this; and our teachers themselves expect this.
Right now there are far too many teachers who are not certified to teach in their area of instruction.
Imagine, a math teacher who is not trained to teach math.
We are one of the few advanced countries in the world to permit this.
It is easy, therefore, to understand why we lag behind so much of the world in math skills.
This is unacceptable and it must change.
Our children deserve better.
We will require that jurisdictions reduce their percentage of non-certified teachers to no more than 2% in order to qualify for funds under our Class Size Reduction program.
As an aside, just last year in my home county of Prince George's County, over 40% of the new teachers hired were not certified in their area of instruction.
This is not right!
As we move forward with our class-size reduction plan, we must simultaneously take strategic steps to ensure sufficient, certified teachers are available well into the future.
With your help the HOPE Scholarship program was initiated last year for Science and Technology students.
We now have the opportunity and the ability to think bigger, reach further and do more!
HOPE must be expanded to include all students who agree to teach in Maryland after they are graduated.
As all of you know, it is my goal to expand our HOPE program every year.
In dream of a day when every child in Maryland enters High School knowing that the doors of college will be open .
. .
IF they work hard, get good grades, and are willing to work in Maryland.
Our proposal expands HOPE each year to cover additional Maryland high school graduates.
By the end of this term--if you agree--every student, in every community, and every discipline will be covered by HOPE.
In want that young man from Oak View Elementary School to study Marine Biology in Maryland!
Many of you here today are first or second generation college graduates--just as I am.
The doors of higher education were closed for so many reasons to those who came before you.
Today, money is the obstacle that blocks those doors.
Just as your parents and grandparents fought to ensure access to higher education for all people years ago, we must fight to ensure access today.
Other States have been able to make this same promise.
Certainly Maryland-one of the wealthiest States in the country--can as well.
We owe it to our future.
. . We owe it to our children.
Of course, these HOPE graduates will not be available to teach for several years.
In the meantime, we will provide additional funding for Maryland's existing programs that attract and retain qualified teachers: The Loan Assistance Repayment Program and the Christa McAuliffe Memorial Scholarship.
This funding will make it possible to graduate an additional 2,000 teachers.
This will bridge the gap until the HOPE Scholarship Program is producing teachers for our classrooms.
As we expand access to higher education, we will enhance quality by providing additional resources.
We are entering the second year of our 4-year, $635 million commitment to higher education across Maryland.
But we must remember that this historic commitment was simply intended to provided stability and some improvement after years of deep cuts in higher education.
We now have the opportunity and the ability to think bigger, reach further and do more!
Maryland has a wonderful University System.
But let us be candid, all of our campuses are not where we want them to be.
Admiral Larson and the task force studying the University System of Maryland, recommend ways to strengthen our system.
We will move forward with legislation to help each and every campus achieve excellence.
That is why our budget provides $102 million in new money for higher education across Maryland.
But even as we provide these additional resources, we must move away from bureaucracy-driven, formula-based funding.
We must instead focus on the specific strengths of our institutions, their missions and their commitment to excellence.
"We must ask three questions of our colleges and universities: ""What is your vision for excellence""?"
"; ""What resources do we need to achieve it""?"
"; And ""How will you be held accountable""?."
"These are the crucial questions, not things like ""What is your funding per Full Time Equivalent Student?""."
The fact is, this commitment to accountability is part and parcel of our entire education program: We will build the classrooms, but the local school systems must hire qualified--certified--teachers for those classrooms.
We will open the doors to college with the HOPE scholarship program, but students must get good grades to qualify and they must pledge to stay and work in Maryland.
We will provide additional funding for higher education, but the institutions must make progress towards excellence.
We are--one and all--responsible for our own actions.
The bottom-line of our education agenda is results--not just resources.
We will-working together-ensure a 21st century where all Marylanders have the opportunity to succeed.
The education agenda I have laid out is ambitious.
It is far reaching.
But if we do not dream, if we do not dare, our children will not have the future they deserve.
It is an investment we must make.
As we usher in a new century, we find Maryland enjoying growth and prosperity.
But we must take advantage of these current strengths in ways that will secure our future.
Thirty years ago, our Lt. Governor's father, Robert Kennedy, spoke about the need to look beyond prosperity when setting a course for the future.
"He said: ""The future does not belong to those who are content with today."
. . timid and fearful in the face of new ideas and bold projects.
Rather it will belong to those who can blend vision, reason, and courage in a personal commitment to the ideals of American Society.
Robert Kennedy understood that the greatest impact of prosperity is that it gives us the opportunity and the ability to rise to tougher challenges.
That is a philosophy we are proud to share in Maryland.
There is no ideal more important.
There is no obligation more sacred.
There is no challenge more in need of our full commitment, than the education of our children.
Together we can rise to this challenge, focus on our children, and step right into the future.
Let us make the next century our century, where Maryland leads the nation and the world: in education; in prosperity; and in fulfilling the abiding promise of liberty and justice for all.
