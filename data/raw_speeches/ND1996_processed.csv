SENTENCES
Distinguished members of the 55th North Dakota Legislative Assembly and all fellow North Dakotans.Good morning.
"Although the legislative session does not begin for another month, today marks the beginning of ""official"" discussions and debates about our state's priorities for the next biennium."
Today we present the results of many months of work.
"First, my personal thanks to the Office of Management and Budget and all the agency directors and State employees who have joined me in bringing honest, conservative fiscal management to our state government."
The priorities we outline in this budget not only determine where we are going for the next biennium; it also shapes the direction of our state for many years to come.
North Dakota today is vibrant and alive.
"Job growth is up, business development in urban and rural areas is on the rise, and our population figures are stabilizing."
Our progress is very encouraging.
But even more encouraging to me is the change in attitude of our people.
"Most of you have been on the campaign trail this fall, so you know what I'm talking about."
North Dakotans are excited about the future and are really starting to believe in the potential of our state.
"In the last legislative session, many of you worked hard to implement some important changes."
"For example, we reorganized the Workers Compensation Bureau, and reduced the rates businesses pay while increasing benefits for the most seriously injured."
"We also provided incentives to the oil industry to encourage horizontal drilling, to re-enter inactive wells and to invest in marginal wells."
These initiatives and others are contributing to a more positive business climate that encourages growth and investment.
"I have said -- and you have supported me -- that we are going to grow this state through economic growth, not new taxes."
"By restraining government growth and spending, we have unleashed the power of the private sector and allowed individual endeavor to flourish."
"This session, without any tax increases, we have $147 million in new revenue to work with!"
The '80s were tough on North Dakota.
State employees went without pay raises.
The state repeatedly failed to meet its obligation to education.
"Businesses closed or moved out of state.We lost 50,000 people!"
"Today, I have good news for North Dakota."
"We are going to be prudent, but we are going to meet the needs that are important including some that, for too long, have gone unmet."
We are going to make serious progress toward achieving equity in our public schools AND we are going to raise the level of excellence at the same time.
We will begin increasing pay to our professors through a special line item for salaries in the Board of Higher Education Budget.
"Economic growth, not new taxes, will help us take another big step in TEEM, our welfare reform project."
"And, we're going to restructure the human services delivery system to relieve some pressure on counties."
"Our economic growth enables us to provide not necessarily more, but better government services for the health, safety and education of our people."
"As careful stewards of this hard-earned revenue, we will fund necessary and essential state programs carefully and make additional wise investments that will provide ongoing returns to our state."
The 1997-99 executive recommendation is 1 billion 494 million dollars in general funds.
"In my budget guidelines in March, I asked agencies to prepare 97 percent budgets that clearly outlined each agency's strategic priorities."
"In preparing the final budget, we used these savings, along with revenue from economic growth, to adequately fund the necessary programs and priorities of our government."
"The budget also makes several sizable long-term investments in education, technology, and water development."
"ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION First, this budget invests $40 million of new money into our K-12 education system."
Well-educated citizens are the very basis of our current strength and will provide the foundation for all future growth and development.
Our education system produces some of the best and brightest students in the nation.
"With this investment, we aim to enhance our education system, increase technology in the classroom, improve teacher pay and professional development, and raise the overall standards by which we measure ourselves."
"First, I am recommending $447 million in Foundation Aid, an increase of $15 million."
"Over the past four years, we have increased foundation aid payments by $320 per pupil."
This budget recommends continuing this tradition.
It also increases funding for special education by $3.7 million and earmarks a total of $1.4 million for the Education Telecommunications Council.
"Technology is changing the face of education, and we must help position our schools to take advantage of it."
Vocational education is increasingly important in today's marketplace.
"North Dakota manufacturers are crying out for welders, electricians and mechanics."
"This budget provides an additional $925,000 to the Board of Vocational and Technical Education to expand programs, equipment and training in the schools."
Last session we made some modest steps to improve funding for the small but necessary schools.
"However, considerable work remains to achieve equity in our school financing system."
"In 1994, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of this system."
"In the October issue of Gavel magazine, several state judges cited school funding as the most important issue facing legislators this session."
I challenge you as leaders of this state to put parochial interests aside.
"You represent your district, but you also represent North Dakota as a whole."
"Let's settle the equity issue this session, and give all our children equal access to excellence and quality."
"To this end, the executive budget recommendation includes $20 million for legislative efforts to improve the school financing system."
"The issue of quality is different from, but related to, equity."
"Last spring, I hosted the first-ever statewide Education Summit."
"Educators, administrators, parents, students, legislators and advocates from throughout the state discussed ways to challenge our children more and elevate the level of learning in our state."
We talked about raising our standards and developing methods to measure what our children are learning.
This budget proposes the next step in that process.
We recommend establishing a $1.3 million fund earmarked for excellence.
"We call it the Myrdal Fund for Excellence after Lieutenant Governor Rosemarie Myrdal, who proposed the concept."
"These funds will improve the quality of education for children by helping educators develop standards, create assessment methods, and provide advanced training and professional development for teachers."
We all have a role in educating our youth.
"This budget creates a partnership between the Governor, the legislature, the Department of Public Instruction and local school boards."
It is a Partnership for Equity and Excellence.
"Working together, we will maximize our individual strengths to shape an education system that will meet the changing needs of our students and our state."
HIGHER EDUCATION Higher education is a second and equally important part of our statewide education system.
"North Dakota's university system should be at the center of our state's efforts to produce well-rounded citizens working in a stronger, more diversified economy."
"Since becoming governor, I have asked higher education to establish clearer priorities and to operate more efficiently together as a unified system."
"And, I believe the system is beginning to answer this call."
"The University System and many campuses have made good starts at working together, at sharing responsibilities and programs."
The type of introspective exercise that has taken place at the University of North Dakota is exactly what must continue to take place system wide.
"They performed the work, now we need to support the very difficult decisions they will be making."
"I commend faculty, students, and administration at all institutions for their efforts thus far."
"But, as the results of the study funded by the Bush Foundation become available, I believe it is important to, as Chancellor Larry Isaak is fond of saying, ""maintain tension on the rope""."
"With their recent overwhelming vote on Measure 2, the people spoke loudly and clearly that change is necessary.We must heed their message."
This budget seeks to craft a new partnership with the University System -- to continue and even accelerate their efforts to unify with a $35 million general fund increase.
Faculty pay surfaced this year as a very public indication that System funding needs to be examined.
"People throughout the state, including me, are concerned about the low ranking of North Dakota professors on national pay scales."
Our teachers work hard in North Dakota.
"I am a product of the North Dakota University System, and I appreciate these professors who deliver a top notch education to our students."
The problem of low salaries is just one of many challenges facing the University System today.
"These challenges have developed over many, many years, and no single entity is to blame."
"This session, I hope we will refrain from pointing fingers, placing blame and dismissing each other's concerns."
"Rather, let us pledge to work together."
We have a meaningful opportunity this session to help shape and guide the University System to address the long-term needs of the state and the people who live and learn here.
"First, this budget recommends creating a $3.2 million pool of money to specifically begin addressing the pay issue."
The money will be part of the Board of Higher Education's budget.
"In this way, the board can manage and allocate the money for the most benefit system-wide."
"Also included is $2 million to improve technology on all the campuses, $2 million to enhance the system's computer network that maintains student records, $1.2 million in equity funding for campuses with low funding for student support services, and nearly $3 million to cover general operational increases due to inflation."
"In addition, the University System receives several major capital improvement projects funded separately from their budget."
"These include animal quarters at the University of North Dakota, an animal research facility at NDSU, renovation of Moore Hall in Minot, remodeling Bute Gym at Wahpeton, initial remodeling of Schafer Hall at BSC and improvements at the NDSU Main Research Center."
The total state share of these projects is $14 million.
"As many of you know, I have been reluctant to endorse new construction on our campuses."
"However, I believe these are necessary and worthwhile investments, which is shown by the local contribution made to each of these projects."
WATER DEVELOPMENT Water development is another critical priority.
"Sound investments in water infrastructure carry high price tags, but increased growth and development will ultimately pay us back tenfold."
"The state currently has numerous water needs, including a solution to the devastating flood in Devils Lake."
"For this reason, I recommend we continue dedicating 20 percent of revenues from the Oil Extraction Tax to the Resource Trust Fund for water development."
This creates an additional $3.6 million.
"This budget also recommends $1.4 million in new general fund revenues, bringing the total available new dollars for water development to $5 million for a total of $53 million for water projects."
The prospects of completing Garrison Diversion are better this year than they have been in decades.
"Should the federal government come through for North Dakota, this project will quickly become the state's top priority."
We are well positioned as a state to focus considerable energy and resources toward delivering Garrison Diversion water to our citizens once and for all.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The 1997-99 budget will continue our momentum in economic development.
"Our focus remains on statewide growth generated from the communities, not the Capitol."
Last session we re-prioritized Growing North Dakota initiatives.
"This session, we seek to fine tune these programs a bit further to more appropriately reflect the opportunities in the marketplace today."
"I recommend adding an additional $300,000 to the successful PACE program."
"It is widely used, and is a valuable tool for local developers in creating incentive packages for new businesses."
"Additionally, I propose expanding the criteria for qualifying for many of the state's financial assistance programs."
"Currently, qualification is based primarily on job creation."
"This is an important criteria, but it should not be the only one."
Business owners should be able to qualify for financial assistance to support capital investments aimed at improving their business's efficiency and productivity.
This will have a tremendous impact on improving wages for existing employees.
We also want to emphasize our initiatives for farming.
The state must make sure we are focusing resources where they are most effective in helping farmers and ranchers adjust successfully to the rapidly changing industry.
Research is an important part of that.
We recommend allocating $43.2 million to NDSU for research and extension programs.
"Research will play a critical role in leading our state's most important industry from the production focus of the past, to a more industrial focus in the future."
New products and different uses for products hold great promise.
"Currently, farmers are maximizing the funding available through the Beginning Farmer program."
"This budget recommends $922,000 for Beginning Farmer and $397,000 for Ag PACE."
Workforce development is a major challenge for our state.
Our highly educated and motivated workforce is gaining national attention as companies like ProMark and Rosenbluth Travel open multiple locations in North Dakota.
"In order to fully capitalize on these qualities, we must train our workers to meet the specific demands of business and industry."
"In my travels throughout the state, business owners frequently express the need for customized training and retraining programs."
"Workforce 2000 is a valuable development tool that links Job Service, ED&F, higher education, vocational education and the business community."
"So far in this biennium, 65 businesses have received funding from the Workforce 2000 program to help tailor effective training programs for their employees."
"Grants from this program have been part of incentive packages for several major new businesses including Marvin Windows and Doors in Grafton, First Bank in Fargo, and Sykes Enterprises in Bismarck."
"These projects alone brought 2,200 jobs into this state."
"Because of this success, my budget recommends investing $2 million in the Workforce 2000 program next biennium."
I am confident this investment will be returned to the state many times over by new or expanding businesses who take advantage of these valuable training dollars.
"TECHNOLOGY With this budget, I also recommend that the state make several significant investments in the area of technology."
These investments come in different forms in a variety of agencies.
Some improve the quality of government services.
"Others prepare North Dakota to take full advantage of the next century, which will clearly be characterized as the Age of High Technology."
"First, we provide funding for a mobile data terminal project for the North Dakota Highway Patrol."
The project will equip 65 patrol cars in 10 sites with computers and global positioning devices.
"Troopers will use the computers to communicate with State Radio, perform instant background checks and instantaneously alert law enforcement agencies and personnel statewide about emergency situations."
The MDT project has numerous public safety benefits.
"Most importantly, it will maximize our current force, and enable officers to spend more time on the road and less in the office filing reports."
It will give troopers much more information and background prior to entering potentially dangerous situations.
"And, it will ensure seamless communication between officers, state radio and other safety or law enforcement professionals."
I also recommend the state's Information Services Division take the lead in providing strategic direction for the use of information technology and telecommunication infrastructure statewide.
"Technology is changing rapidly, and we must be confident our investments in technology throughout the state are proper and prudent, not only now, but for the long term."
"In recent years, many agencies have contracted with private consultants for technology improvements."
"As a result, compatibility between agencies is not what it should be."
The Wolfe Report commissioned this biennium makes several recommendations for improving the consistency and interface of state technology initiatives.
"With this budget, we recommend implementing some of these strategies to ensure the state is taking a broad view of our telecommunication investments."
"As we forge a path toward higher technology in North Dakota, we must travel together toward a strategic, not accidental, destination."
"This budget also recommends funding increases to improve the Tax Department's tax payment and return processing system, to enhance IVN/ODIN in higher education, and to advance a project that will unify libraries throughout the state on one computer network."
HUMAN SERVICES One measure of a society is how it deals with its least fortunate and most vulnerable members.
We in North Dakota take great pride in our long tradition of providing a high-quality and cost-effective continuum of care to our senior citizens and the most needy among us.
Our proposal for delivering health and human services to our citizens continues that tradition while meeting the challenges presented by a return of responsibility from the federal level to state and local government.
"Fortunately, we laid a solid base for reform during the last legislative session."
Federal welfare reform efforts now permit us to tailor programs that are truly responsive to the needs of low-income and dependent North Dakotans.
"Included in our $343 million general fund human services budget proposal is a recommendation to expand our TEEM (Training, Education, Employment, and Management) project statewide."
"This initiative will simplify and standardize Heating Assistance, Food Stamps, Employment and Training, Child Care Assistance, and the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF grants, that replace the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payments."
The focus of our programs changes from financial dependency to personal responsibility and self-sufficiency.
I believe counties should not pay for economic assistance grant costs over which they have no control.
"Therefore, I am recommending the state relieve counties of all responsibility for TANF grant costs."
"In exchange, the counties will pay the full cost of local administration, which they can control."
This swap proposal is made possible by statewide implementation of TEEM and is an important first step toward some day transferring responsibility for all Medicaid and Basic Care grant costs to the state.
These reforms should provide significant relief to our overburdened property taxpayers.
"As I am sure you all know, Medicaid costs are a significant portion of the increase in the DHS budget, amounting to $54 million."
"The largest share of these increases, $23 million, provides nursing home care for our seniors."
"I am also excited to report that Food Stamp coupons will be eliminated in the spring of 1997, replaced by Electronic Benefit Transfers."
"The statewide use of EBT debit cards will make the program more user friendly and help deter fraudulent transactions, reduce issuance costs, simplify food purchases by Food Stamp households, and help grocers receive timely payment."
"Our DHS budget proposes several other enhancements including improved access to dental care for low income children and the disabled, and use of the Children's Trust Fund to provide targeted case management for pregnant women and infants."
"In addition, we remove perverse incentives for restrictive and costly institutionalization by extending the policy to prevent the impoverishment of spouses of elderly or disabled people receiving home and community-based services under a Medicaid waiver."
"Our Health Department budget recommends funding for EMT training and a statewide trauma care coordinator, provides for additional inspection of food and lodging entities to reduce the incidence of food borne illness, and adds a chemist in the state crime lab to work on methamphetamine cases."
CORRECTIONS The population at the State Penitentiary is increasing dramatically.
We are carefully examining the reasons for these increases.
"As a nation, we are getting tougher on crime."
"Mandatory sentences, longer sentences, fewer parole releases, truth-in-sentencing laws, court unification and changes in good-time laws are all contributing to more inmates in our state prison."
"And, the reality is, there are more serious offenders today than in the past."
This budget recommends $6.6 million to address increasing populations in our correction facilities.
We are looking at every available option.
"We will find the safest, most cost-effective way to manage these criminals."
"Currently, corrections officials are scouring the state for an existing building that could be readily converted into a second medium security facility."
The state itself owns numerous vacant buildings.
I am confident we will find a proper location.
The other option being considered is contracting for prisoner space in other states.
"If the population continues to climb, as experts predict, contracting out is not the most cost-effective solution."
"We recommend adding six more parole officers, two counselors and additional support staff at the penitentiary to handle the increasing population."
The budget also moves 15 temporary correctional officers into permanent FTE positions.
"The bottom line is, the safety of those working at the prison will be ensured."
The public must continue to feel secure.
"And, criminals in this state must know they will be caught and duly punished."
EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION North Dakota's state employees are at the heart of our state's top-quality government services and operations.
"I would match our state workers with those in any other state, and I'm confident ours would be the friendliest, most committed and hardest working group of professionals."
Many of our state employees regularly go beyond the call of duty to perform their job well.
"It is only right that we appropriately compensate our employees for their work, whether they are changing oil in state cars, maintaining our beautiful capitol grounds, or helping place children with foster parents."
The employee compensation package I recommend provides a 3 percent employee pay raise in each year of the biennium.
"However, in order to reward and encourage excellence on the job, half of each year's pay increase will go to all employees and half will be used by managers to address compression problems or provide merit raises."
One of my goals as governor is to update the employee compensation programs to base pay raises on performance and objective annual reviews.
"To this end, I recommend giving the Workers Compensation Bureau their portion of the 3 percent salary increase in a lump sum to be used for a merit pay pilot project."
The Bureau will provide pay raises independent of Central Personnel.
"Raises will be based 100 percent on merit and performance, enabling the Bureau to reward excellence appropriately."
CONCLUSION Four years ago I talked about a new era of opportunity in North Dakota.
We have worked hard in my first term to foster an environment that now offers us the luxury of investing new revenue in improved services for our citizens.
We have struggled together through difficult times.
"But our sacrifice and our dedication have been rewarded with a new confidence in our state, a new prosperity that we must nurture and promote and guard jealously."
"We have new resources that afford us a chance to re-craft, reformulate, and retool higher education, human service delivery, and elementary and secondary education, and move them into the 21st century."
But we must be cautious as we face the important task of stewarding the precious resources entrusted to us.
I believe we have crafted a budget of which the people of North Dakota can be proud.
And I want to assure them that they can also be secure in knowing we will not betray their confidence in us.
They have told us they want us to be responsible.
They have told us they want us to be efficient.
"They have told us they want us to grow our economy and our state, not our government."
Individual endeavor and private initiative have restored the character of North Dakota.
"But, despite our favorable circumstances, our emphasis will remain on restraint."
"We must never, and we will never, forget that it is not our money;."
It belongs to the people of this state.
"We, therefore, must be judicious and prudent in its investment, always remembering that our obligation is not just to today, but to the future."
"To that end, I ask that the spending levels proposed in this budget be considered ""bottom line."
"If the revenue projections released in March predict increases beyond the $147 million we used in preparing this budget, I propose the additional dollars be distributed in the following manner: First, I recommend that any additional general fund revenues produced by oil and gas taxes be set aside in a permanent natural resources trust fund against the inevitable day when this revenue source begins to decline."
"Second, excess general fund revenues produced by all other taxes would be directed on a dollar-for-dollar basis to two additional funds."
The first fund will provide additional resources for water development projects.
The second will be used to provide a tax rebate to the hardworking taxpayers of North Dakota.
"I believe strongly that, if our revenue picture warrants it, these additional dollars should not be spent by government."
"They should go back in the pockets of our citizens, where they belong."
"Members of the Legislature, Democrats, Republicans, North Dakotans and friends all, I present this budget to you for your consideration."
"Read it, study it, analyze it critically, and know it represents the combined effort of hundreds of dedicated public servants who want to do the best job they can of serving their fellow citizens."
"God bless you, and good luck as we begin the important work the people of North Dakota have entrusted to us."
I look forward to the opportunity to meet this challenge together.
