In 1997 alone, 9,613 new jobs were created -- more than any year in our history.
In addition, 103 companies announced the location of new facilities, and more than $1 billion of new capital investment has been committed.
Just last week, three additional announcements of new facilities in one day will result in 950 new jobs for 1998.
More will follow.
Equally important, the new jobs are not just concentrated in one fortunate region, but they have been created all over West Virginia.
The map clearly demonstrates the geographic diversity of the 1997 investments.
Also, these new jobs provide unprecedented economic diversity.
Creating new jobs now requires a global strategy.

Last year, I worked closely with Auditor Glen Gainer and State Treasurer John Perdue to use the purchase card for state government.
Purchases of less than $500--and soon less than $1,000--are authorized with the card instead of using the time-consuming, expensive process of vouchers and checks for relatively small purchases.

We committed this administration to giving the taxpaying public the best dollar value possible.
I believe we are moving in the right direction.
Tonight, I ask you to consider three major initiatives essential to build an even better West Virginia.
The first relates to our most valuable resource, our children.
OUR CHILDREN Over the years, I have benefited from the wise counsel of my wife on a wide range of issues, but most especially on matters relating to children.
She continues to serve on the board of directors of Cammack Children's Center and Big Brothers/Big Sisters in Huntington.
She will head the Starting Points program to promote responsible parenthood and provide early education and care for children under five.
Discussions with Mrs. Underwood and other advisors confirm my own strong convictions that the time is right to take more aggressive steps to safeguard the interests of our children.
The recent tragedy in Weston has aroused the conscience of our state.
We must do everything in our power to ensure that this tragedy is never again repeated.
We also must act decisively to improve the care of children in the state's custody and to make sure that those children who are neglected and abused are protected.
More than 300 of these children in the state's care are placed out of state because in-state providers have lacked the incentive to provide or expand services to these children.
Out-of-state placements are estimated to cost up to three times more than comparable care right here in West Virginia.
This irrational, costly and inhumane system must change and change now.
It is time to bring West Virginia's children home.
I have asked the Department of Health and Human Resources to move as expeditiously as possible to act on requests to expand services so most of these children can be returned.
In addition, Mrs. Underwood and I will personally involve ourselves in recruiting new foster parents to provide loving care for many children who have had to be institutionalized and many of whom remain out of state.
A toll-free number will be advertised to encourage the identification of foster parents for these very deserving children.
Last year, through the Balanced Budget Act, Congress created a Children's Health Insurance program for the states.
It provides an 81.57 percent federal match to states that extend care to uninsured children.
Through it, we can purchase insurance, provide coverage through Medicaid or design our own combination of both options.
More than 23 million federal dollars a year are available to West Virginia for this program during the next five years.
In prosperous times, it's easy to forget that the voice of the poor is often the voice of a child.
It does little good to speak of a healthy economy if we tolerate a society of unhealthy children.
Young parents, often single parents, with low-wage jobs earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and often not enough to afford adequate insurance.
They are left out, and their children suffer as a result.
Medical treatment, hearing defects, anemia, diabetes, human suffering -- these are the results of this void.
Even though we have cut infant mortality in half and made other important gains in health care for children, no one dare suggest we not try to do better on all fronts.
Each of us is committed to serve as guardians and protectors of the most vulnerable among us.
We have a singularly unique opportunity here -- one that rarely comes our way -- to bring hope to thousands of children and their parents and provide health care for an estimated 16,000 uninsured children in West Virginia.
Tonight, I am announcing the creation of a combined Legislative/Executive Task Force to reconcile this issue.
I shall work very closely with you to develop a program to extend insurance coverage to these eligible children, and I ask you to make its consideration an urgent priority during this session.
PUBLIC EDUCATION The second major initiative is in public education.
We have made enormous strides to improve public education, and I am determined to make 1998 the year that we take our educational reform and progress to a whole new level.
Education Week, the nationally respected magazine that rates states on education programs, gives Connecticut and West Virginia the highest rating for 1997.
We all know that we can and must do better.
I commend the Education Commission on Quality and Equity and its chairman, Ben Hayes, for their excellent product.
Now is the time for us to evaluate the findings and thoughtfully consider how they can best be applied.
I endorse the Commission's basic finding -- that we must build a school system more accountable for results.
In the proposed new model, high expectations and high standards are set for each student.
Performance is then measured through a range of tests and assessments.
Students, teachers, school administrators, school boards and, ultimately, legislators and governors are held accountable for the results.
Wherever deficiencies are found, we collectively have the responsibility to resolve them.
This new model will demand the best from all of us.
We cannot afford to fund education at higher levels without achieving the results to justify the confidence of the taxpaying public.
Certainly, in the past few years we have made substantial progress in improving school facilities and, more importantly, the teaching and learning environment.
Accordingly, I will ask you to ensure that the revenue stream dedicated to the School Building Authority continues to be protected.
By this method, we can invest $50 million by 2005 in modern facilities as bonded debts are paid down and revenue is recaptured.
This pay-as-you-go program will guarantee world-class libraries, science and language laboratories, distance learning centers and modern classrooms for the 21st century.
But all the modern facilities are wasted if we do not reach the segment of our students who drop out and are otherwise lost.
Within the next few weeks, we shall launch a new program in 30 counties across our state entitled Jobs for West Virginia's Graduates.
This is a cooperative effort between government and the private sector to employ specialists in high schools in each of these counties to encourage high-risk students to remain in school through graduation and to provide individualized assistance to develop essential job skills.
These specialists will further assist the students for a nine-month period following graduation to ensure a smooth transition from high school to college or the workplace.
This is an important step to guarantee that no student is left out of the exciting progress we are making in education.
The budget before you also includes an additional $10 million for computers in grades 7-12, bringing the total for fiscal year 1999 to $26 million.
The basic skills program in K-6 has proved its value; we now must assure that secondary students can continue their development in computer skills.
I believe it also is time to require computer literacy as a high school graduation requirement for all students, and I shall ask the State Board of Education to take this important step.
By the same token, I ask higher education to make computer literacy a requirement for all new teachers entering the profession.
Finally, we must not lose ground in our struggle to pay competitive salaries for school employees.
The budget that I shall submit to you will provide a $750 across-the-board pay raise for all school employees.
I anticipate requesting at least this much in each of the next two years for a total of $2,250.
Perhaps we can do even better in the future years as funds become available.
While we must require our teachers to be better prepared and perform at very high levels, we also must do all that we can to recruit and reward them.
I believe that this three-year commitment begins to uphold our part of the bargain.
The budget also includes funding for the third year of the planned five-year salary increase for higher education faculty and staff and an additional $1 million in funding for the Higher Education Grant program.
By the end of this century, we will be well on our way to an accountable, productive system that demands the best and produces the best -- essential ingredients in any long-term economic development strategy.
We must all accept the realities imposed by a dynamic and increasingly competitive global economy.
Either we improve the educational background skills of our work force, or we will be left in the dust.
The vast majority of our fellow West Virginians wants to work; they abhor the welfare culture.
We must give all West Virginians a secure educational ladder to climb higher and higher, and I believe we have now established the essential rungs in that ladder.
"For nearly 20 years, the courts, legislators and governors have wrestled with the complex issue of educational funding and the constitutional mandate to provide a ""thorough and efficient"" education."
It is high time that we resolve this issue once and for all and disentangle the courts from the school system.
The Commission on Fair Taxation will complete its findings by July 1, 1998.
The issues of tax reform and educational funding are inextricably tied together and should be considered together.
INFRASTRUCTURE The third major initiative relates to infrastructure.
The continued improvement of highways, airports, telecommunications, and sewage and water systems is essential to enhance our potential for new jobs and new business.
The progress of the past decade is apparent to those who travel our state.
However, important new initiatives must be undertaken to improve our transportation and telecommunication infrastructure and to strengthen our competitive position.
The map depicts the progress that we have made in the construction of the Appalachian corridor system, as well as the Interstate system begun during my first term.
Our great challenge is to complete a statewide, integrated four-lane system to facilitate economic development and create jobs in and around population concentrations of the state.
First, let me say clearly and definitively, we are going to build Corridor H, and I pledge every resource of this administration to that end.
It will serve the one large area of West Virginia without access to a four-lane highway.
In southern West Virginia, we must complete three strategic triangles to expand and diversify the vast economic potential of the region.
The eastern side of the first triangle is already complete in the West Virginia Turnpike.
The southern side will be completed with the construction of the King Coal Highway to connect Welch with Bluefield, and the third side will be the Coalfields Expressway.
This budget includes $5 million in state funds to build the Welch interchange, which will begin to link these two vital highways.
The second triangle will be completed when the King Coal Highway extends from Welch to Williamson with the other sides being the Coalfields Expressway and Corridor G. The third triangle will be complete when the King Coal Highway is constructed between Williamson and Kenova (in Wayne County).
The other two sides of this third triangle already are complete with Corridor G and I-64.
Moving to the important Ohio River basin, the fourth triangle will be completed when Route 2 between Huntington and Parkersburg is upgraded to four-lane status.
Interstates 64 and 77 have already completed the other two sides.
From Parkersburg to Chester in Hancock County, we need to begin immediately to accomplish two objectives on Route 2: first, to bypass the bottlenecks and, second, to begin a long-term plan to connect existing stretches of four lane highways.
This area represents another triangle formed by Parkersburg, Chester and Clarksburg.
A major bottleneck continues to exist in Parkersburg, where the four-lane Route 50 stops at I-77.
I have asked the Division of Highways to accelerate the final environmental clearance so we can begin construction in 1999 and complete the project to the Ohio River.
It is also essential that we complete Route 9 from Charles Town to Martinsburg and then on to Hedgesville in the rapidly growing Eastern Panhandle.
To begin initial steps of our plan, I shall ask you to approve the sale of $220 million in road bonds authorized by the voters in 1996.
The first $50 million will be set aside to draw down another $200 million in matching federal funds.
This sum of money will fund the first phases of the projects I have just outlined.
Secondly, $170 million from bond sale proceeds should be used for state and local service roads, for safety improvements and bridges.
These funds will be directed exclusively to the roads where the people of West Virginia live and work.
Our schools, hospitals, churches and businesses are located on these roads and, tonight, I ask you to make an unprecedented commitment to their substantial improvement.
This program will greatly accelerate paving and widening roads, placing stone and gravel on dirt roads and gradually replacing all posted bridges.
The program will include more than 300 safety projects with a minimum of at least three projects in every county.
In addition, this commitment will allow the Division of Highways to begin the orderly and systematic inclusion of all the orphan roads in the state, and the next step will be to develop a three-year plan to ensure that the roads are in usable condition.
Tonight, I renew my strong commitment to building a new regional transpark to serve the huge market encompassed by the Kanawha Valley, the tri-state area and much of southern and central West Virginia.
Too many air passengers in the tri-state area drive to Columbus, Cincinnati and Lexington in search of lower fares and greater flight availability.
We are experiencing a huge erosion in our air traffic market all over West Virginia.
We must recapture this market, but we can accomplish that objective only by serving larger populations with better service.
That result can best be accomplished by building one large regional transpark.
In addition, the new transpark is an indispensable ingredient in a comprehensive economic development strategy.
It literally will serve as a magnet for more jobs for West Virginians.
Last year, I pledged to you a public-private partnership to develop a crossroads of commerce where major highways converge.
I am pleased to report to you that on December 18, 1997, ground was broken to bring critical infrastructure to the first of those crossroads.
The Fayette Plateau Regional Water System is a public-private partnership of this administration with West Virginia-American Water Company, Fayette County, cities and public service districts.
The massive $42 million project will bring a better quality of life to 24,000 people and greatly assist economic development for the entire Fayette Plateau area.
The growing tourism industry in the New River Canyon can now come to full blossom.
This crossroads of commerce would not have been created without a public-private partnership -- a partnership that I will continue to pursue, building each year an infrastructure network throughout West Virginia to create economic growth and development.
To give more consistent and complete attention to the need for water and sewer lines, I have asked the Infrastructure Council to develop a long-term, statewide plan and to investigate strategies by which we can encourage more public and private partnerships such as the Fayette Plateau project.
The budget before you also includes 8 million new dollars to pay the debt service on new infrastructure bonds.
These dollars will allow the sale of an additional $91 million for water and sewer projects all over West Virginia.
Last year, I also pledged to you that I would seek technologies for products, services and jobs.
This administration has moved swiftly toward that end.
In a public-private initiative with Bell Atlantic, we have begun to build a new $20 million broadband telecommunications network with the potential to improve the lives of all West Virginians.
"This broadband network, known as ""West Virginia 2001,"" will be completed within the next 24 months."
It will consolidate voice, data and video communications on a single phone line at extremely high speeds.
It will provide advanced technology to West Virginia state government, colleges and universities, schools and health care providers.
The consequences of this partnership are enormous: West Virginia, within 24 months, will be a national leader of telecommunications.
Our colleges and universities instantly will share complete information; our state's rural physicians will have instant access to sophisticated technologies, vastly improving health care delivery.
"Our people can be ""telepresent,"" rather than physically present, in the classroom or in the doctor’s office."
I have asked Bell Atlantic to establish a grant program to furnish special equipment to higher education, health care and governmental institutions to help them use the network.
Bell Atlantic has agreed to my request, thus greatly complementing its WORLD SCHOOL program, which links all West Virginia kindergarten through 12th grade public schools in its service area to the Internet.
It is difficult to comprehend how far technology has advanced.
On this date 120 years ago, January 14, 1877, Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone was demonstrated to Queen Victoria at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.
Her Majesty was reported to be amused.
The budget I submit to you tonight is based on revenues of $2.594 billion.
The budget is balanced and every account funded.
Included in the budget is an across-the-board pay raise of $750 for state employees.
I anticipate funding the same raise in each of the next two years for a total of $2,250.
We are asking more from our employees as we downsize state government.
It is only fair that they be rewarded for greater productivity and service.
Recognition of their contributions is long overdue.
Other new commitments in the 1999 budget include 20 million additional dollars in the Public Employees Insurance account to prevent any backlog from developing and to secure future benefits for all public employees without any premium increase.
An additional $1.8 million is directed to hiring and training an additional 25 state troopers to improve public safety and replace retirements.
I also recommend an increase of $5 million for repairs and maintenance of senior citizen centers, which have been neglected far too long.
I ask you to act on my legislation to bring about tort reform.
We are one of a very few states that has not attempted to deal with the abuse of the court system.
Baseless lawsuits hurt every person in every community.
Not just business, but consumers, churches, schools and non-profit local charities all pay the price of lawsuit abuse.
West Virginia is no place for crime directed against anyone based on race, gender, religious preference, ethnicity or cultural reasons.
Such crimes must be prosecuted to the limits.
I have created a Minority Business Task Force to expand business opportunities in our growing economy.
Access, inclusion and equity remain goals of higher education and state employment.
During his tour of the United States – including a trip down the Ohio River more than a century ago -- French philosopher de Tocqueville observed and admired the willingness of Americans to volunteer and come together as citizens.
Under the strains of 20th century society, our impulse to help one another has gradually eroded.
Individual interests were lost in an institutional groundswell of bureaucratic regulations.
This administration has sought the same kind of cooperation and partnerships with the volunteer communities that we enjoy with the private sector.
Our efforts have been greeted with an overwhelmingly positive response.
The Governor’s Cabinet on Children and Families has created a Family Resource Network in all counties as basic building blocks for community growth.
Following the President’s Summit on America’s Future last April in Philadelphia, West Virginia held its own Governor’s Summit in October.
Every county sent delegates to make a total of 600 volunteers committed to reaching 36,000 children in need by the year 2000.
Surplus contributions from the Governor’s Inauguration were used as seed money to create Mission West Virginia.
This not-for-profit organization works through the churches of our state to mobilize and cooperate with other groups to attack illiteracy and improve the health standards through prevention and wellness.
It offers reading, writing and work skills to families in a value-oriented environment.
In my entire life, I can never remember a time brimming so completely with optimism and opportunity.
Unfortunately, progress does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability.
We will succeed only if we plan wisely, invest soundly and work diligently.
"Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel wrote a new cantata in 1995 entitled ""A Song for Hope."
He explained it was a song for hope, not a song of hope.
The two are different: the first is an appeal; the second is an answer to an appeal.
During the past decade, the leaders and people of West Virginia responded to the appeals for hope from earlier generations.
As a consequence, we can now sing a song of hope.
This new hope frees the state’s own economic apothecary to build a healthy body.
No longer will we be tempted to seek political magicians or snake oil salesmen to treat our economic ills.
Every day we make government a better, more effective instrument to improve our state and the lives of its good people.
Tonight, I share with you this blueprint to use our resources to maximum advantage to build the future.
We do not discover the future; we build it.
I have outlined the challenges we face.
I offer you my enthusiastic hard work and sincere cooperation to accomplish our great mission.
With your help and God’s blessing, we will move forward to the 21st century.
