Lieutenant Governor, First Lady, elected officials, Majority Leaders Nelson and Dorso, Minority Leaders Mathern and Boucher, legislators of the 56th Assembly, and fellow North Dakotans.
Good afternoon.
Gov. Ed Schafer delivers the 1999 State of the State address Jan. 5 to the 56th Legislative Assembly.
I am pleased and honored to be here today to report on the state of our state on this, the opening day of the final Legislative session of the 20th Century.
The Year 2000 is a significant milestone – one we have been looking toward for several years and one historians will look back upon forever.
As we anticipate and prepare for the new millennium, we should remember that January 1, 2000, is not a line we will cross in 360 days where everything on the other side will look and feel and operate differently.
Changes in the new millennium will sneak up on us, sort of like that first time you look in the mirror and realize, no matter which angle you take, all your hair has turned gray.
"One morning we’ll notice that our fax machines have been replaced with e-mail, we no longer drive to work, and only the real ""old fogies"" know what a cassette tape is."
We will continue to see even more dramatic change.
And our success, perhaps our very survival as a state, depends on our ability to acknowledge these changes and prepare for them.
Our world is evolving from the industrial age to an information-based society.
Rather than let these changes drive us, I want North Dakotans to sit in the driver’s seat.
The new millennium can serve as our scenic overview.
Let’s pull over this year and look at where we are as a state.
More importantly, let’s determine what we want our destination to be.
Certainly, we see significant changes in the landscape of North Dakota.
In the past 70 years, 80,000 farms have become 30,000, and the economic and technological forces behind this trend are still at play.
Shifts in agriculture have had incredible consequences for rural communities created to support farm families and the agriculture industry.
Rural schools struggle for students … Main Streets struggle for business … Businesses struggle for customers….
But changes in agriculture are not the only factors at work in North Dakota.
Society itself has changed.
People have endless opportunities available throughout the world.
Travel is fast and affordable and advanced communications make it easy to stay in touch with family and friends at home, even from the most remote corners of the globe.
While this process has been occurring slowly for 100 years, the effects could be the most dramatic in North Dakota during the next decade.
A quick look at some of our state’s demographic information explains why: Significantly fewer young people are establishing roots in our rural areas.
The number of people under 18 on farms declined from 64,000 in 1970 to just 17,000 in 1990.
"Two-thirds of North Dakota counties are designated ""frontier"" and have fewer than 6 residents per square mile."
Schools throughout the state are projected to have 17,000 fewer students by the year 2010.
At the same time, our median age is rising and sits at 35 today compared to 26 in 1970.
Gov. Ed Schafer fine tunes his speech during a practice session the day before his State of the State address.
These trends present enormous challenges for all of us, but also huge opportunities.
As unique as the changing of the millennium is, so too, are the opportunities we have today.
If we invest in and plan for the future we desire, we can capitalize on these changes and create new wealth and a greater quality of life than we already enjoy in North Dakota.
The alternative is to bury our heads in the sand – or, in our case, the snow – and act as if these changes are not occurring.
That approach would mean disaster for North Dakota.
Our challenge, our opportunity is to develop a new North Dakota.
We must dare to step out of the comfortable Chevy and Ford models of today, and into an exciting hybrid-fueled North Dakota for the 21st Century.
During the last six years, we have already begun building the prototype for our new vehicle for success – and the results are encouraging: Employment is at record high levels throughout the state.
In fact, an upcoming issue of Newsweek magazine will feature Fargo for its incredibly low unemployment rate – the lowest in the nation!
We have new industries in manufacturing, ag processing, telecommunications….
and we’ve targeted more industries for growth.
Revenues and taxable sales have increased between 5 and 7 percent annually for the last six years.
In my budget message, I proposed many additional initiatives to enhance economic development.
I recommended significant increases in funds for value-added agriculture and research; investing $30 million more in higher education; improving tourism resources; and jump-starting an excellent workforce training program.
We are off to a good start.
BUT, if we want to reach our full potential, we must continue seeking opportunities, taking risks, and creating a new vision for our state.
We need to increase wealth.
Growth in our personal income has been too modest, and lags behind the rest of the nation.
We need more opportunities for our young people to obtain challenging jobs right here at home.
And our rural areas need new viable industries and identities beyond production agriculture.
We must maximize our water, wildlife and other natural resources to help stimulate rural North Dakota.
It is disappointing to see threats to the progress we have made in the last six years.
We’ve all heard about the troubling signs lingering on our horizon – our population declined slightly last year after a few years of growth, our revenues are not as bright, the economy is slowing down.
But we don’t have to accept these signs as evidence that our destiny is fixed.
I refuse to give in to the forces that are trying to throw us into reverse today.
As long as I am governor, I am going to work relentlessly to propel us forward to new destinations.
Gov. Ed Schafer practices with staff the day before his 1999 State of the State Address.
My speech today doesn’t provide any easy answers to our challenges.
"I won’t promise 100,000 new teachers, 100,000 new cops or that I will simply ""feel your pain."
And although three-strikes-you’re-out sounds clever, it doesn’t do much for what ails North Dakota.
No, the solutions for our challenges exist in only one place – in the courageous, creative minds and deeds of each and every North Dakotan.
I know we can create new opportunities, new wealth and new hope for our state, but we must embrace new thinking and we must work together.
So today, I will propose some ways to bring our minds together to create a new North Dakota for the 21st Century.
First, we need to cultivate new pioneers in this state, new chauffeurs to drive us into the future.
The information age is removing barriers that have long-limited North Dakota’s economy.
In today’s high-tech world, we don’t have to be a remote, unknown place where economic success shoots up and down dramatically with world wheat markets.
Technology can liberate North Dakota.
Combine it with our pioneering spirit, our ingenuity, and our strong work ethic and we will have a tool as powerful and instrumental to our state as the railroads were 100 years ago.
Through telecommunications, people can work from their home in Watford City just as well as from an office in New York City, from Mayville as well as Louisville, or from Hague just as well as from Prague – well, Prague … but you get my point.
Our educated, dedicated workforce can be trained to meet the needs of any company.
And North Dakota’s safe communities, good schools and excellent quality of life are more appealing all the time to urban dwellers fed up with traffic and crime.
North Dakotans across the state are already giving us a peek at what is possible.
Look at Great Plains Software.
Fortune Magazine recently named this home-grown corporation one of the one-hundred best companies to work for in the nation.
Or ReliaStar Financial Corporation – just last month this company announced plans to expand its business into North Dakota, bringing up to 400 new jobs to Minot and great potential for growth.
Or consider businesses like US Bank, TMI, Dakota Growers, Melroe and Sykes – they all have seemingly endless appetites for our top-notch employees.
Gov. Ed Schafer delivers his 1999 State of the State address And, in my observations, our farmers are showing perhaps the greatest forward-thinking of anyone in the state.
Every day I read about a new innovation – branded beef, Roundup-ready crops, global positioning technology for applying inputs….
Although our farmers and ranchers continue to face major problems caused by poor weather and garage-sale prices, we can be encouraged by recent reports of many farmers who used alternative crops and forward contracting to shelter their losses.
They foresaw the problem and used good old-fashioned North Dakota courage and ingenuity to limit its consequences.
Farmers are proving that with innovation they will prosper in North Dakota.
They can be the lead drivers in diversifying our economy.
These ideas are the future of our state.
Our opportunities are limited only by the creativity of our minds.
And this, I believe, is our last great barrier.
Technology has eliminated many of the physical and geographical disadvantages that have historically held us back.
Now we must overcome the barriers within ourselves.
We need to change that widely held but often unspoken assumption that people – especially young people – must leave North Dakota in order to make good money, to make profitable investments, to find challenging jobs or enjoy an interesting lifestyle.
Last year we started a statewide effort to generate public interest and enthusiasm for developing new leaders.
We found more support and interest in Leadership North Dakota than we ever dreamed of.
Thousands of citizens jumped on buses and into cars to participate in four statewide events.
"This year, we are going to use this same initiative to ""signal and pass"" the negative attitudes and self doubts that hold us back!"
The Leadership North Dakota committee is a powerful cross-section of representatives from many of our state’s most influential agencies and organizations, including the Rural Development Council, the Greater North Dakota Association, the League of Cities, RECs, ED&F and the University System.
This year, I am asking this committee to organize a grassroots, multifaceted campaign to get North Dakotans at all levels thinking and believing in new opportunities and a new vision for our state.
Young people are a top priority, and plans for our first youth project are already underway.
North Dakota youth are smart, talented and have the same strong values we cherish.
They are our state’s future parents, business owners, entrepreneurs, leaders.
They are a resource we desperately need, not just in future decades but now.
On April 11 and 12th, we will hold a statewide Youth Leadership Summit in Minot.
We are working with schools, churches and every youth organization we can find to recruit young people to participate.
The Indian Affairs Commission is also making the Youth Summit one of the highlights of its 50th Anniversary Celebration.
In planning this event, we’ve asked teenagers what issues they are interested in.
We can all take heart in their responses.
They want to talk about jobs, economic development, the future of North Dakota…I hope lots of them are listening right now on the Internet, because our youth can help us face change without fear.
I’m hopeful the Youth Summit will be a good first step in motivating our young people to be the pioneers – the drivers – of the 21st Century right here in North Dakota.
"At the same time, I want to devote the next year to ""Celebrating Longevity in North Dakota."
Rather than bemoaning the fact that our state’s elderly population is growing, let’s take advantage of this resource.
Seniors offer a wealth of knowledge, experience, and talent that no amount of studying or training can match.
They are the caretakers of our cultural heritage, and a source of the strong North Dakota values that are critical to our future.
"The Governor’s Commission on Aging is leading a committee to coordinate ""Celebrating Longevity"" activities in conjunction with the 1999 International Year of Older Persons."
Local and statewide events throughout the year will focus on heritage sharing, longevity in the workplace, involvement with youth, and health and wellness.
The committee is working closely with organizers of the Youth Summit to foster interaction between young and old attendees, including a one-on-one mentoring program between senior volunteers and youth participants.
Possibilities like this are endless, and I look forward to seeing the many unique ideas that come from this initiative as North Dakota pioneers of the past, present and future interact and learn.
Let me talk for a minute about building 21st Century schools.
In my budget address to legislators, I recommended $476 million for K-12 foundation aid, an increase of 9 percent over current spending.
My administration and this legislative assembly have consistently made education our top priority.
In my budget I also proposed initiatives to enhance technology in our schools, improve professional development for teachers, strengthen vocational education programs, and provide sizable salary bonuses for teachers who earn national certification.
Technology, professional development, salary increases – all of these are essential for our education system.
The state is committed to helping local school districts provide North Dakota children the best possible education our money can buy.
Unfortunately, education faces the same reality as all other functions of government.
Our money is limited and must cover a lot of critical needs in our state.
This situation implores us to squeeze the greatest value out of every state and local dollar we spend on education.
This is why I launched the Report Card for the Future initiative last year.
Our education system faces a very serious challenge in the next 10 years.
Enrollments will drop by 17,000 students, with the greatest impact on rural areas.
I hope we can change that number through economic development and job recruitment.
But we cannot afford to wait.
We must start preparing now for these declines.
The Report Card for the Future asks school districts to carefully examine their enrollment projections and involve community members in developing plans to address them.
Of the 229 districts in our state, 81 participated.
It’s not too late and today, I challenge those who chose not to join the effort to see the value of this exercise and of planning for the future.
I want to congratulate and thank our teacher of the year Fran Armstrong from Beulah who is here today, and represents one of those schools who endorsed the Report Card of the Future initiative.
I am encouraged by the results from those who participated: In Grand Forks, 150 community members attended their public meeting, some even asked that it become an annual event.
They developed six planning principles for their future.
Rugby is focusing on reaching out to smaller schools in the area, and even considered innovative concepts such as boarding students in town to avoid long bus rides.
Minot is incorporating the Report Card for the Future into a broader, community-wide visioning effort.
In Willow City, 60 community members helped develop alternatives for the future, which include certifying teachers in multiple areas, using technology and independent study to enhance curriculum, sharing with other districts, AND, closing the school when enrollment drops below 75 students.
And in Lisbon, they adopted the motto: Excellence is the Expectation.
My compliments to these and other forward-thinking school superintendents who are facing realities and actively seeking new opportunities in education even amid their challenges.
Your ingenuity, your leadership and your faith in the future is creating the schools of the 21st Century that will be one of our state’s most important assets.
Regardless of the size of our schools, I know we all agree – we must assure that North Dakota students will always be at the top of their class.
Certainly, one of the most important factors of a healthy, vibrant state is efficient government… Government that is reasonable and balanced in spending and regulation.
Government that invests well in education, health and safety for people.
Government that takes the very least amount of money necessary from citizens… This will be the Government of the 21st Century.
My administration and the Legislature have worked hard to promote this philosophy.
We have searched for new ways to operate government agencies.
We have targeted millions of new dollars toward education, health and safety programs – all of it generated by economic growth.
And, we have refused all increases in sales or income taxes for the past six years!!
And today, I will propose several additional initiatives to reinforce this philosophy and make it a fundamental approach to government in this state.
We need to institutionalize fiscal discipline for the future of North Dakota.
The state Department of Human Services is one of my administration’s best and untold success stories.
Since 1993, that agency has dramatically changed its basic tenants of operation.
They have embraced new ideas and dared to disrupt old programs or traditional ways of operating.
The number one goal of today’s Human Service agency is to help people and families maintain their independence, self-sufficiency and self-worth.
How are we doing that?
Our welfare reform program and a strong job market have helped move more than 3,000 families off public assistance since 1993, a 50 percent decrease.
We eliminated food stamp coupons and replaced them with modern electronic debit cards that are easier for businesses and friendlier for clients to use.
We helped 2,000 North Dakotans postpone or avoid moving from their homes into nursing care facilities last year by providing more options for home- and community-based care.
The oldest recipient of in-home services was 108 years old!!
This is not only more compassionate, it’s much more cost effective.
The average cost for these services per person was $335/month – far below the $3,000 per month of typical nursing home care.
We have also focused more resources on preventive health, especially for children.
In 1997 we screened more than 10,000 children for basic health problems – things like immunizations, hearing and vision defects.
This is up from 3,000 screenings in 1993 – a 340 percent increase.
And, our state’s Healthy Steps insurance program will soon cover children of working parents who currently fall between the cracks of available health insurance programs.
For the next two years, we are going to enhance our preventive health efforts for youth even further.
I am directing the state Health, Human Services, and Corrections agencies to lead an intensive two-year focus on teenage alcohol and drug abuse prevention.
The initiative will be a joint effort between local communities, tribes, schools, law enforcement and others.
Recent data from national studies reports that drug and alcohol abuse costs the nation $275 billion per year.
Our own penitentiary is a vivid example.
Drug and alcohol abuse is at the root of 85 percent of criminal behavior that leads to incarceration in North Dakota.
National studies suggest that every dollar spent on alcohol or drug prevention ultimately saves $7.
No matter how you look at it, this is well worth our attention.
We will focus existing dollars from each of the agencies involved toward this effort, and we are applying for additional federal grants as well.
By combining dollars we can focus up to $6 million on this initiative this biennium.
Drug and alcohol abuse destroys individuals, devastates families and drains public resources.
We cannot afford to waste our state’s young minds and bodies on addiction.
Let’s do everything we can to give our youth the healthy start they deserve.
This brings me to a different, but related topic.
I want to discuss the tobacco settlement and what it means for North Dakota.
Over the life of this 25-year agreement, North Dakota could receive more than $700 million – $30 million in this biennium alone.
"I stress ""could."
Considerable uncertainty remains about when, if and how much money North Dakota will receive.
I argue – I believe – spending dollars we do not yet have would be fiscally irresponsible.
We should have two goals for all potential settlement money: public health and fiscal responsibility.
We can address both of these with the following plan.
First, I am proposing we devote 10 percent of any tobacco settlement dollars to public health programs, including important initiatives on diabetes, drug and alcohol abuse, and tobacco prevention and cessation.
This will fund programs primarily driven at the local level, and will provide a six hundred percent increase over current state spending for local public health!
To further enhance prevention efforts, we should make our laws more effective in our fight.
I urge the Legislature to raise the state's minimum age for possession of tobacco from 18 to 19.
At the same time, we should reduce the penalty for possession from a rarely prosecuted misdemeanor to a more appropriate infraction that police are more willing to enforce.
These measures would give educators and law enforcement the tools to keep tobacco out of schools.
We must stop sending a mixed message – that tobacco is bad for kids, while turning a blind eye to smoking on high school campuses.
Then, we should place 45 percent of any dollars from the tobacco settlement in the Common Schools Trust Fund.
"How often have we looked back a decade or two after a new revenue source starts flowing and said, ""We should have set that money aside, let it build, and used the interest""?"
We can show foresight by allocating this new, potentially great and still uncertain source of revenue for the education of future generations of North Dakota's children – money that simultaneously relieves the burden on local property tax payers.
The remaining 45 percent of settlement dollars should be returned to the pockets of North Dakota taxpayers.
Our taxpayers have borne the burden of the tobacco-related health care costs for many years.
The tobacco settlement compensates states for their costs, so it is only appropriate that the state compensates the taxpayers.
I am proposing that the money be delivered as an annual property tax rebate.
In comparison to other states in our region, North Dakota's tax system is well balanced and generally fair.
Yet there is a growing sense that property taxes should be scaled back, and tobacco settlement dollars could help us achieve this goal.
I am also asking the Legislature to send a constitutional amendment to the state's voters asking them to make this funding allocation permanent.
Even with the best of intentions, the millions of dollars that will come to North Dakota in the next 25 years might tempt less fiscally conservative leaders to grow government, launch new programs, or bail us out of a fiscal mistake.
The tobacco settlement affords us a good opportunity to provide tax relief to citizens.
But I want to take an additional step to improve our tax policy.
Legislators will act this session on a ballot initiative to require a super majority of members from both the House and the Senate to pass any increase in sales or income taxes.
I support this idea.
I think it is fundamentally solid, and a move I believe people of this state will also endorse.
The Legislature will still have the authority to raise taxes.
However, this measure would ensure that any effort to take more money from the citizens of this state is supported by an overwhelming majority of legislators who represent those citizens.
I’ve always said my role as governor is to represent taxpayers to government, not government to taxpayers.
And I believe these initiatives will help create healthy people and a healthier economy through a healthy faith in North Dakota citizens.
Given the chance, they will make the right choice.
CONCLUSION As most of you know, it has become my tradition to walk around the mall of the Capitol the night before my State of the State speech and seek inspiration for the conclusion amid the trees, the snow and the history that decorate our beautiful grounds.
I talk to you about what I see there: The Indians and their environmental wisdom, lore and culture… The pioneers struggling to carve a new life out of raw prairie… Our veterans fighting for freedom and democracy… Our children laughing, singing and leaping for joy… The courage that North Dakotans carry in their efforts to forge a life on these often unrelenting prairies.
I was thinking of these things as I headed out the door once again last night.
Knowing the temperature was hovering around zero, and contemplating what a modern pioneer might see on a night like this, I took off my coat, hung up my scarf, tossed my mitts on the shelf, and stayed inside.
I decided to do my walk the modern way – on the Internet!
Hitting the North Dakota web page, I linked onto the legislative site and viewed our beautiful Capitol building.
I could almost see it glimmering in the cold crisp night.
A beacon of hope, a symbol of opportunity and faith in the future.
I can only imagine the controversy of the 22nd Legislative Assembly when they appropriated $2 million for the building in the midst of the Great Depression when the state faced severe financial limitations.
Replacing our burned out Capitol took courage, and the state’s then Governor Shafer and legislators were not limited by a lack of vision or creativity.
They made this investment.
(And bonded for the project, by the way.
And as this building inspired confidence in our citizens then, today we must continue to make this very Capitol a shining light, pointing to tradition, courage, innovation and prosperity.
We have a special place here.
Margaret Wade, the former publisher of the Bismarck Tribune, recently wrote a salute to North Dakota.
"In describing this state, she said, ""Here I found hearts and minds and spirits rooted in things that are valuable and good and rare in this world."
We enjoy some magical qualities in North Dakota – things people in other, perhaps warmer, places would love to purchase if only money could buy them.
We have a responsibility as citizens to preserve this special piece of earth, to help it successfully change and grow and become a resilient place for future generations to live and raise a family.
In my six years as Governor, I’ve made an observation that troubles me.
I’ve decided that we are too often our own worst enemies in North Dakota.
Differing political or economic interests place their priority on narrow, short-term gain, limiting our ability to attempt constructive change or even to have intelligent public discussions about the critical issues we face.
I’ve seen it time after time – whether the issue is school financing, higher education reform, or agriculture funding.
The most sensitive and really, the most critical issues become polarized or political, and in the long run no one wins.
In fact, we all lose.
But we can’t afford to lose the battles we face today.
We must support our leaders, encourage new ones, listen openly to new ideas and work together to create a new North Dakota for the 21st Century.
The world is changing around us, and I firmly believe we are at the forefront of incredible opportunity.
Our strong work ethic, moral courage and sense of community can create for us the opportunity to compete anytime, anywhere, anyplace.
I ask North Dakotans to join with me to seize these opportunities!
Together, we can forge a new frontier!
We can cultivate the new pioneer!
We can ensure a better life for those who follow!
Each and every one of us deserves to expect a better future – if we are willing to work for it.
After all, we are North Dakotans!
God Bless each and every one of you.
God Bless North Dakota.
