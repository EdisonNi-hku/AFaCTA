sentences
Speaker Daniels .
President Philip .
Justices of the Supreme Court .
my fellow Constitutional officers .
members of the 89th General Assembly .
and my fellow citizens of Illinois, Two months ago .
the voters of this state and this nation sent a clear and strong message they want less government .
not more.
Less interference.
More efficiency.
Less red tape.
More accountability.
Less bureaucracy.
More common sense.
They told us they want government to offer the needy a helping hand .
not a handout.
They want to feel safe in their own homes .
and they want those who break the law and violate their security to get the punishment they deserve.
They want an education system that promotes learning and rewards excellence.
They want less rhetoric .
and more results.
I believe we have been on the right track during the last four years.
We have moved state government in a new direction of reform .
efficiency .
effectiveness .
and accountability.
When the voters spoke in November .
they reaffirmed this new direction.
But they didn't say that we had accomplished enough .
that we could put the ship of state on automatic pilot.
They are demanding more change .
more results from us .
and we need to deliver.
We in Illinois have the great opportunity .
and the awesome responsibility .
to respond to that mandate quickly and creatively.
And we must respond.
We have the opportunity to build on the progress we have achieved.
And we will.
We have the opportunity to control the cost of government.
And we will .
by curbing local taxes .
and continuing to make state government more efficient and more effective.
I don't want to increase taxes.
And I don't believe most members of the General Assembly want to either.
We must continue to be frugal.
And we must continue to tighten our belts if we are to be succesful in holding the line on taxes.
We must continue to live within our means.
We must continue to demand more productivity and more accountability.
During the last four years .
we brought a halt to the building of bureaucracy.
If the trend in place when I became Governor four years ago had continued .
agencies under my control would have expanded by nearly 6,000 employees.
But we didn't expand.
We downsized.
We cut those agencies and even reduced the payroll by 3,000 employees.
And we did so while staffing additional prisons to keep dangerous people behind bars . . and adding hundreds and hundreds of caseworkers to respond to child abuse and neglect.
We showed that state government can actually accomplish more with less.
And we will continue to demonstrate that.
As a matter of fact, I am proposing today that we consolidate three code departments that deal with natural resources .
Conservation .
E. N. R. . and Mines and Minerals into a Department of Natural Resources .
and eliminate two governing boards in higher education.
And we are going to be looking at other possibilities for reorganizing state government to slash administrative overhead and further downsize the bureaucracy.
Streamlined .
downsized .
more cost-effective .
and more accountable government.
That's what we've been doing.
That's what we'll continue to do.
Because the people who pay for state services .
and those who rely on state services .
deserve no less from us.
And we have every right to expect the same reforms and fiscal restraint from local governments in Illinois.
Four years ago .
after a prolonged battle .
we capped property taxes in the five collar counties in the Chicago metropolitan area.
Since then .
the property taxes have not skyrocketed as they had for years before.
Tax caps have worked.
Homeowners and businesses in the collar counties have been spared 300 million dollars in property tax increases since we put the brakes on.
Caps do not starve local governments.
But they do curb their appetites.
And two months ago .
more than 80 percent of Cook County voters said they wanted caps.
How did some local governments react?
By padding their budgets and their tax levies.
They sensed that this Legislature would help me cap property taxes in Cook County.
They got the message, all right.
But they responded in the wrong way.
You and I need to respond in the right way.
I think we should respond to the voters of Cook County and cap property taxes in Cook County .
and give the voters in the rest of the state the same opportunity.
And .
we need to write into the legislation that those local government units can't get away with what they tried to do.
As I have said since 1990. all of Illinois should have property tax caps.
With your approval of my proposal, we'll be getting closer .
especially in those areas that have been hardest hit by soaring property tax bills.
Indeed .
we have the opportunity to accomplish much for the people and businesses of Illinois.
And we will continue to make progress .
with renewed .
and I hope bipartisan .
cooperation between the Executive and Legislative branches of government.
The presiding officers of this new .
dramatically changed legislature .
and I agree.
We need not wait until the closing hours of this legislative session to act . . responsibly and responsively . . on major reforms.
The expansion of property tax caps.
Reforms in the court system that will stimulate job creation in Illinois.
Reforms that will continue to move people from welfare to work.
Reforms that will improve learning in our classrooms.
Reforms that will build on our efforts of last fall .
when we enacted the most sweeping anti-crime package in decades.
Property tax caps .
tort reform to spur job creation .
school reform .
continued welfare-to-work initiatives .
and anti-crime legislation .
I want all of it sent to me on a fast track.
Not all matters can be handled so expeditiously.
I understand that.
Some will have to wait until the closing days of the session.
But .
when the final gavel falls .
we should be able to say with conviction and credibility that we responded to the people's will .
that we kept Illinois moving in the right direction.
To do so .
we must reaffirm our commitment to high-quality education in every corner of Illinois.
That means stable and predictable funding.
It also means spending that money wisely and effectively.
The state of Illinois experienced some very difficult financial times during the last four years.
Still .
by making the education surcharge permanent .
we saved 1.6 billion dollars for schools that otherwise would have been lost.
Indeed .
the state has provided an additional half billion dollars on top of that.
And we will continue to increase funding for our schools .
as you will see when I deliver my budget for next year to you on March 1.
But money is only part of what should be the three R's of our educational priorities.
Resources .
reform .
and results.
There are some innovative and dynamic things going on every day in the classrooms of this state.
They are stimulating children to learn.
And they are providing them with insights that will shape their lives in very positive ways.
But we cannot be comfortable with the status quo.
We need to take advantage of the technology revolution and put it to work for our students and our teachers.
We must fulfill our 75-million-dollar commitment to build a statewide telecommunications network . . a network that has virtually unlimited potential for bringing the best in instruction to students and businesses throughout Illinois.
Already .
30 million dollars are at work providing the infrastructure that will enable students to learn from teachers and professors a hundred miles away.
Twice in the past year .
I have hosted day-long technology summits .
where leaders in the state's education and technology fields had an opportunity to exchange views on the status of technology in our schools .
and plan for its expansion.
Those summits showed we have a tremendous investment in technology at all levels of education.
But in many ways it seems we are just beginning to tap the potential of that technology.
With the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Kustra and continued state financial support .
we will expand the number of classrooms and businesses using technology to bring new educational opportunities to our students.
By this time next year .
I want students in every Illinois school to be able to access the information highway that will open new worlds of knowledge and intelligence to them.
I also am proud of the job Illinois has done in requiring accountability from our schools.
While other states are just talking about education reform .
Illinois is implementing it.
We are issuing report cards to help parents .
business executives .
and taxpayers determine whether schools are producing the right results.
And we are requiring corrective measures when the results are unacceptable.
But we must continue to reform.
We cannot afford to leave education rooted in the timeworn practices of the past.
If we do not act today .
we may never catch up.
We need to give our educators and local school boards the flexibility to determine what works best in their classrooms .
liberated from the shackles of bureaucracy.
So .
I am asking the Legislature once again to approve my initiative for a Learning Zone for the Chicago public schools.
By establishing such a zone .
we will test a thesis strongly held by me and many others.
Reform can best be achieved by empowering educators .
parents .
and communities in Chicago.
Allowing them to focus on what will improve learning. . and freeing them from the state mandates .
the layers and layers of centralized bureaucracy .
and the red tape that inhibit reform.
I also am asking the General Assembly to empower communities in all regions of the state by permitting them to establish charter schools . . schools that would be held to high standards . . but not micro-managed by state mandates in how to meet those standards.
The charter schools and the Chicago Learning Zone offer an innovative approach to relieving the frustrations many of our educators have told me they feel.
They want more flexibility at the local level.
More business involvement.
More participation by parents.
More bottom-up reform.
Fewer top-down directives.
Less of Springfield passing out the orders.
Toward that end .
I also am proposing and will gladly sign legislation allowing school districts to easily obtain waivers from many burdensome and costly state mandates.
Those waivers can free up instructional time.
And help stimulate innovation and enhance student performance.
Indeed .
much of that reform . . much of our efforts to improve student performance . . must focus on those students who are not bound for four-year degrees.
I'm talking about two out of every three students in Illinois.
And programs for them have been under-emphasized for too long.
We will continue to expand apprenticeship programs and other innovative efforts for those who won't be attending four-year colleges and universities . . even as we press for reforms in those institutions of higher learning.
To be sure .
we have some of the most respected universities in this nation.
And the higher education community has made substantial progress during the last four years.
"At least 115 university programs were found to be unnecessary and were eliminated . . More than 130 downsized or consolidated. . More than 260 community college programs eliminated or reduced or restructured because the ""status quo"" could not be justified."
The reforms have given renewed emphasis to undergraduate education . . to removing hurdles for the student who is willing and able to earn a bachelor's degree in four years.
But .
as we have said before .
it is time to remove unneeded layers of governing bureaucracy.
We should eliminate the Board of Governors and the Board of Regents .
and let the universities be governed by their own trustees under the oversight of the Board of Higher Education.
And .
it makes no sense for the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois to be elected by voters .
who understandably know little or nothing about the candidates .
except perhaps their political affiliation.
That board should be appointed .
just like the others.
And we should bring the Sangamon State University under the umbrella of the University of Illinois.
We have accomplished much in making schools at all levels more accountable . . and helping them meet the challenge of keeping Illinois businesses and workers competitive.
But there is much more that should be done now . . to assure not only that there are enough capable workers for the jobs of the future . . but also enough jobs for all the capable Illinois workers who will want them.
Because of our moderate tax structure .
Motorola is building a 100 million dollar production plant in McHenry County.
Because we have held the line on taxes .
more than 3,000 new jobs will be available to our workers there.
Because business has thrived .
the Illinois economy is strong and becoming stronger.
Illinois' unemployment rate is its lowest rate in more than 20 years.
A record 5.7 million Illinoisans are working .
the highest in the history of the state.
Illinois added more than 82,000 jobs during 1994 in a broadbased expansion that we expect to continue this year.
And the earning advantage of our workers has increased nearly 43 percent since 1991.
But we must build on the momentum.
We must stimulate even more job growth because too many Illinoisans still aren't working.
And we can do that by removing roadblocks to prosperity that discourage job creation and raise consumer prices.
As I said last year .
and the year before .
and the year before .
it is time to bring some sanity to the Illinois tort liability system.
It is time to reduce the number of costly and frivolous lawsuits that clog our court system and cost all of us far too much money .
and too many jobs.
Those victimized by the neglect of others should be compensated.
But is there any reason for a civil lawsuit to be filed every 30 seconds of every business day in Illinois?
Is there any legitimate purpose for more than a quarter million civil suits a year?
Those who cause harm to others should be held liable.
No question about that.
But should the expectant mothers in 30 Illinois counties be denied medical advice and services because no physician is willing or able to pay the cost of malpractice insurance?
Or should the Girl Scouts of DuPage County be forced to sell 35,000 boxes of cookies just to cover their liability costs?
The only people benefitting from the system in place are a few .
very wealthy lawyers.
The rest of us are paying .
whether we realize it or not.
It is time for a dose of fairness.
It is time to put a ceiling on awards for non-economic damages in medical malpractice and product liability cases.
We need to look at continued reform of our workers' compensation system.
And it is time to reform or perhaps even repeal the archaic Scaffolding Act that now allows injured workers to receive worker's compensation as well as to sue for additional damages.
Those reforms will help all of us .
as taxpayers .
employers .
employees .
and patients.
We need to assure the workplaces of this state are safe.
But we also need to do whatever we can to stimulate the creation of more workplaces.
And .
on another front .
we need to assure that Illinois workers who are covered by insurance can retain it if they change or lose jobs . . and we need legislation to expand coverage to many, many others.
We can achieve that expansion by making it easier for businesses to band together and obtain insurance at prices affordable for both employers and employees.
We should not .
and cannot .
wait for Washington.
On health care.
And on welfare reform.
It is clear that states will be taking on additional responsibilities .
and hopefully be given new flexibility .
especially in the area of human services.
I and other governors welcome that prospect.
We are ready and willing to accept the challenges presented by the dawning of a new era in federal and state relations.
In fact .
I urge this General Assembly to join other state legislatures throughout the nation in passing a resolution calling for a Conference of the States . . to redesign and reshape federalism in the United States.
But .
even as this historic transition unfolds in our federal system .
we must continue moving ahead in Illinois.
Our state has been a leader in helping welfare recipients move from dependence to independence.
We have worked to break the generation-after-generation cycle that has locked far too many families into lifetimes on public assistance.
We are encouraging welfare recipients to find work.
And once they do .
we are not penalizing them for bringing home a paycheck.
We have removed obstacles that penalized welfare recipients who took temporary jobs.
And that discouraged fathers from staying with their families.
Through our Earnfare program .
we provided thousands and thousands of former welfare recipients with work and a pay check.
We are giving teenaged mothers 18 and under the help they need to complete their high school educations and find meaningful work.
And if the mother does not participate .
she eventually will lose a portion of her monthly aid check.
But there is more that can and should be done to assist our welfare recipients in becoming self-sufficient.
In Illinois today .
there are thousands of mothers on public aid who have no job .
and no children under the age of thirteen.
We will expand our welfare initiatives to require those women to seek and hold down jobs to qualify for their welfare benefits.
And .
we will launch even more initiatives as we get a better sense of whether Washington . . under new congressional leadership .
will truly give us more opportunity to innovate in the welfare area.
Meanwhile .
this administration will continue to crack down on child support deadbeats.
We have collected record amounts of child support -- 225 million dollars last year .
a 50 percent increase from what we were collecting just four years ago.
That is money that has supported families that otherwise might have been totally dependent on taxpayers.
Often fathers duck their responsibility .
claiming to be unemployed and without the resources to meet their court-ordered support.
My administration will initiate a program to require those delinquent fathers to participate in supervised job search programs .
or in our Earnfare program .
so they can meet their obligations to their children.
We are helping families.
Because stronger families mean stronger neighborhoods.
And stronger neighborhoods mean stronger communities.
We are working to make sure the system works for the people.
Not the other way around.
We are working to coordinate social services at the local level in the school through Project Success .
which is now underway in 90 communities throughout Illinois.
In our Lincoln's Challenge program .
we are teaching the high school dropouts of this state values far different than those they learn on the streets.
Through Help Me Grow .
the First Lady's campaign for children .
we have increased awareness of existing services to help children .
their parents .
and caregivers.
The one-stop shopping program we have launched with the assistance of the Casey Foundation is being watched by the nation as an innovative model for delivering human services effectively .
efficiently .
and compassionately.
The problems facing children .
and families .
in this state are many.
They are complex.
They are inter-related.
Poverty .
teen pregnancy .
violence .
alcoholism and substance abuse.
All are claiming far too many victims among our children and their parents.
All too often we attempt to solve these problems from our desks in Springfield and Chicago.
But we know that state government does not have all the answers.
State government cannot solve all the problems.
But state government can and should be a catalyst for change.
A unifying force that brings churches .
parents .
local business .
schools .
and community organizations together to break down barriers that limit effective programs in their neighborhoods.
Rather than attempting to impose solutions from Springfield .
we must look to local communities to identify their needs.
And to suggest and implement solutions.
We will continue our efforts to prevent tragic child abuse and neglect.
In the last year .
the number of child abuse calls to the DCFS hotline increased to more than 385 thousand.
A record number of 45 thousand children are now in the state's care .
an all-time high and a 22 percent increase last year alone.
We have seen that additional funding is not the only answer.
In the last four years .
we doubled funding for the Department of Children and Family Services .
to more than one billion dollars.
We have hired hundreds of new caseworkers to ease the workload.
We have fired workers who did not do the job.
We now have on the books laws to ensure that a child's interests are to be considered above all else.
We now have on the books laws to hold DCFS and community agencies to even higher standards.
But government can do only so much.
All of us in this community called Illinois must work together.
And we must work together to stop the violence that has turned far too many of our neighborhoods into armed war zones.
Too many neighborhoods whose residents have become prisoners in their own homes.
And aren't even safe there.
In September .
Brenda and I went to Roseland .
a community on the South Side of Chicago determined to do something about the curse of gangs and violence.
Two thousand people from that community joined us.
Determined to begin the daunting challenge of taking back their neighborhood.
All of us .
ministers and teachers .
law enforcement and community workers .
parents and public officials .
must band together to point our youth in a positive direction.
For there is nothing but a troubled future ahead for our young people .
and our society .
if we do not.
At the same time .
we must be tough on those violent criminals who break the peace and threaten our security.
And we have.
As I said earlier .
last month I signed the most sweeping reforms of our criminal justice system in decades.
It gives police and prosecutors valuable new tools in their daily fight against gangs .
guns .
and violence.
It imposes the death penalty for murders in drive-by shootings.
It mandates tough new penalties for gun-related violence .
by juveniles and adults.
It establishes secure facilities in Illinois for dangerous delinquents.
And it makes it easier to try 15 and 16-year-olds as adults for gang and drug-related felonies involving firearms.
Those new laws afford more protection to the men .
women .
and children of Illinois.
But there is more that should be done.
We should give the statewide grand jury the power to investigate gun-running.
And we should strengthen and expand our sex offender laws.
The Child Sex Offender Registration law should be broadened to cover offenders .
no matter the age of the victim.
And to require periodic registration .
in person .
with law enforcement agencies of those convicted of these monstrous crimes.
And I believe we should mandate that convicted sex offenders who move into Illinois provide DNA samples .
just as those who commit sex crimes in Illinois now do.
We need to take advantage of this growing and proven medical technology to build a database against which sex offenses can be checked.
We must continue to protect our citizens from those who threaten our society and put our people in harm's way.
And we must also continue to protect our treasured natural resources from the forces that threaten them.
Illinois has a proud past.
And we must preserve that heritage that has made Illinois the great state it is today.
We must continue our efforts to further reduce the stream of waste that heads to our landfills .
which has already decreased every year for the past four years.
We must continue our efforts to protect our natural lands from development.
Such as we have done by purchasing the 15 thousand acres of Site M in Cass County.
And as we have done by acquiring more than two thousand acres of prime woodland along the Rock River in northwestern Illinois.
We will work with the new Congress for the legislation that will reclaim 19 thousand acres of the Joliet Arsenal for natural areas and outdoor recreation.
I am also renewing my call for this General Assembly to approve Conservation 2000 . a six-year plan that will take a long-term approach to managing Illinois' natural resources .
helping our agriculture community conserve soil and water resources .
and developing a wide-ranging plan for green ways and recreation trails.
Indeed .
we have a duty to take a long range view when it comes to managing our natural resources and addressing many of our major concerns.
But there is at least one area where the shorter the better.
I'm talking about the length of the campaign season in Illinois, one of the longest in the country.
Long campaigns are grueling for the candidates.
And for the people of this state.
So I am asking this General Assembly to approve changing the date of our primary elections from March to September.
Three days ago .
I renewed the sacred bond I hold with the people of this great state.
Just yesterday .
you members of the General Assembly took a similar oath.
Together .
we are partners for progress.
Today .
let us celebrate that renewed beginning.
Let us remember our past achievements.
But look to the future.
Let us remember the reason the people sent us here.
And the job they sent us to do.
Today .
let us move forward.
With cooperation.
With compassion.
With common sense.
And with courage.
Today .
let us get to work.
Let us get the job done.
And done right.
