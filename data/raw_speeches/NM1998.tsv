Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of the Forty-third Legislature, distinguished guests, my fellow New Mexicans: Our state constitution wisely sets aside this time every year for the citizens and public servants of New Mexico to come together and assess the condition of our state.
It is an opportunity for us to look back at the past and see how far we have come.
Perhaps, more importantly, it is an opportunity to look to the future and chart our path to tomorrow.
Today is the twentieth of January, 1998.
We are two short years away from the new millennium.
There has never been a more important time in the history of New Mexico, and I firmly believe that the choices we make today will have long-term consequences for ourselves, our families and our state as it heads into the new era.
We will have to make a number of very specific choices, and I will get to those in a moment.
But first, I would like to say something about our direction as a state and as a people, and what it means for our lives and our democracy.
Today we face the opportunity, the responsibility and the challenge to choose excellence or to choose mediocrity.
At this crossroads in time, we have the opportunity to choose people and principles before politics.
The choice between these diverging paths could not be more stark.
Our schools are in dire shape.
We can choose to continue supporting a school system that is bureaucratic, unaccountable, expensive and ineffective.
If we don’t think that our children deserve any more than that, all we have to do is sit back and let it happen all by itself.
Or we can make a different choice.
We can make a commitment to excellence.
We can exert the energy and effort necessary to overhaul our schools from top to bottom, demand accountability, ensure safety and discipline, offer parental choice, and provide for early education.
We can achieve educational excellence, but only if we in this chamber put people and principles before politics, and only if all parents demand more from their elected representatives.
We can sit back and continue to pay for prisons and a legal system that are too expensive, too crowded and too soft on criminals, or we can demand private prisons, truth-in-sentencing and no-frills incarceration.
But, we will only clean up our courts and our prisons if we in this room put people and principles before politics.
We can continue to let government manage our economy from Santa Fe by raising our taxes, imposing even more burdensome regulations, and perpetuating poverty by resisting welfare reform.
Or we can renew our commitment to the people of New Mexico now and into the twenty-first century by leaving behind a legacy of smaller government, fewer regulations, welfare reform, more small business growth, and lower taxes.
The change I speak of has only just begun.
In the past three years, I believe this state has begun to choose excellence over mediocrity ¾ but there is so much more to do.
Just three years ago, government budgets were growing almost ten percent annually and hundreds of state employees were added to the payroll every year ¾ all paid for by your hard earned tax dollars.
Today, we have cut budget growth in half and dropped more than one thousand-seven hundred employees from the government payroll.
That means less bureaucrats in government and more money in your pockets, and that’s what I mean by people and principles before politics.
Just three years ago, Medicaid costs were running out of control with fifteen to twenty percent annual growth, growing five hundred percent in the last ten years alone.
Today, with managed care reform, the Medicaid budget is actually shrinking, generating millions in savings.
That means quality healthcare for more New Mexicans and a better quality of life for everyone.
Just three years ago, government was adding hundreds of welfare recipients every few months; with bloated welfare rolls growing to nearly 35,000 families.
Today, welfare rolls have been cut by fifty percent in just the last eighteen months.
There are now fewer than 18,000 families on welfare.
That means more people with better jobs, better incomes, and better opportunities for the future.
For too many years, our prison system has been run according to the random, chaotic, unwieldy demands of consent decrees and cost overruns.
Just last month, the notorious Santa Fe Old Main prison facility was closed, and next December the infamous Duran Consent Decree will be vacated.
That means we can have real truth in sentencing and no frills incarceration.
Three years ago, the term government efficiency had no real meaning.
Today, we are implementing more than one hundred government efficiency measures, which will save millions of dollars.
That means that we finally have a government that does more with less ¾ a government that is more responsible and accountable to you ¾ because we put people and principles before politics.
Just three years ago, there were no Indian gaming compacts, and non-Indian gaming was unregulated and dangerously ignored.
Today, compacts have been signed, gaming will soon be regulated, and millions of dollars of gaming revenue are set to flow into the state treasury.
And, it’s all because we did the right thing.
I believe that together, we have helped put New Mexico back on the road to excellence.
We deserve to be proud.
And although it has required a considerable amount of hard work from all of us, there have been rewards.
Not just the reward of doing the right thing, but real dollars-and-cents rewards as well.
Our hard work over the last three years has brought New Mexico to a turning point.
If we do not choose our path wisely, we stand to lose all that we have gained, and all that hard work will have been for nothing.
We must decide whether to continue forward or retreat into the ways of the past.
The decisions we make today, here in Santa Fe, will affect the daily lives of every New Mexican tomorrow and in the years ahead.
Those of us in government must hold ourselves to a higher standard.
We cannot settle for the stale ways of the past, the same old failed government programs that stifle citizen creativity and create dependency.
We must shake ourselves awake and rededicate ourselves to the pursuit of a brighter world, a world of possibility and promise, a world where every New Mexican can share in that great promise we know as the American dream.
But this ship of state cannot turn on a dime.
Fundamental changes in the way we think about government, about citizenship, and about the kind of future that lies just out of reach, only take hold over time.
In the last three years, New Mexico has begun to turn things around.
Just imagine where New Mexico could be today if we would have spent the last three years cooperating instead of bickering.
Imagine how many tax dollars we could have saved, and how many lives would have benefited.
Just imagine how much more we could have accomplished.
But that is the past.
With the legislature’s cooperation ¾ your cooperation, we will be able to do much more in the years ahead.
We will put people and principles before politics.
We will put results over partisanship.
We will do more with less, and we will restore accountability to state government.
Let us resolve today that we shall not pause in our efforts.
Let us resolve that the work of building a better tomorrow shall not falter.
Let us once and for all put petty rivalries aside, and close our ears to political bickering.
Let us instead keep our sights fixed always on tomorrow, the path into the future.
New Mexico’s future depends on a new vision.
A vision: Of a government that delivers quality services at a reasonable cost; Of a welfare system that builds self-sufficiency rather than dependency; Of a prison system that punishes violent criminals instead of pampering them; Of an economy built on low taxes and good roads; and Of schools that actually teach and students who actually learn and prepare for the global economy of tomorrow.
I am determined to make this new vision a reality, so that New Mexicans will become economically stronger, physically safer and personally self-sufficient.
New Mexico has made great strides in pursuit of this new vision.
We must not hesitate.
We must take the next bold step.
A great opportunity is at hand.
We must seize it.
Today, I make this pledge: We will reinvigorate our schools.
We will end government waste and mismanagement.
We will maintain our roads and build new highways.
We will restore public confidence in our prisons.
We will reform welfare.
We will fulfill our dreams and the dreams of our children.
It is no secret that the Johnson administration and the Democrat leaders of the legislature have profound differences.
But those differences have not stopped progress.
We have begun to make a change.
We have built new prisons and roads, reformed welfare and Medicaid, and increased school funding.
And we accomplished this without growing government or raising taxes.
When we put aside talk and focus on results, we can make real progress.
These accomplishments have not only rejuvenated our institutions — they have made good financial sense as well.
Restoring common sense to state government has led to a multimillion dollar dividend; a bonus for the citizens of New Mexico.
A bonus for New Mexico because we reduced the size of government and the growth of government budgets.
A bonus for New Mexico for converting Medicaid to managed care.
A bonus for New Mexico for overhauling our welfare system.
A bonus for New Mexico because we have begun the overhaul of our prisons.
A bonus for New Mexico for our successful efforts to reform the way state government works.
These accomplishments and many others mean dramatic savings for state government and a better life for our citizens.
They are the result of common sense and a lot of hard work.
And in the name of responsibility and accountability, I demand that this great New Mexico bonus be invested wisely ¾ invested in education, invested in highways and invested in tax relief.
This year, let the people of New Mexico share in that bonus.
We can and should give every taxpayer in the state a pay raise by giving everyone a tax cut.
That’s progress, that’s real change, and that’s worth fighting for!
The accomplishments of the last three years — the start we have made toward realizing New Mexico’s bright potential — will benefit all New Mexicans.
But we will not reach that bright new day without a fight.
There is a conflict of visions in Santa Fe.
That fight — between the new path of optimism, responsibility and common sense and the old path of pessimism, dependency and government ineptitude — that fight will determine the shape of New Mexico’s future.
Let me tell you how I hope to make my vision a reality.
I offer this legislature a budget, a plan, and a challenge.
A budget to control state spending, approach our economic problems with prudence and earn the common sense bonus our citizens deserve.
A plan to invest that common sense bonus in our schools and roads, and to reduce our taxes.
A challenge to adopt a package of reforms today that will improve our quality of life tomorrow.
The new budget must attend to unfinished business.
I challenge the Forty-third Legislature to take these actions to guarantee the common sense bonus this year: 1) Reform welfare now.
Mr. Speaker, welfare reform legislation is ready for your action and my signature.
Thousands of former welfare recipients already have jobs.
Individuals who can work — must work!
Our tax dollars must be spent only to help those who are truly in need.
Let’s make self-sufficiency a way of life for all New Mexicans.
2) Protect and promote ­ Salud!
One year ago Medicaid expenses were increasing at the rate of sixteen percent.
Today, those expenses are decreasing at a rate of three percent.
And today, our ­ Salud!
program provides the same great health care coverage that most other New Mexicans enjoy.
­ Salud!
works!
3) Complete the overhaul of our prisons.
The Duran Consent Decree will be vacated this December; Santa Fe Old Main prison facility is being closed; the new prisons will soon be completed; our prisons are becoming drug free; and the privatized prison operations this legislature authorized in 1995 will become a reality in 1998.
If the legislature will cooperate this year, we can have a prison system ready for the next century.
4) Adopt low growth budgets for most of government.
Chairman Coll and Chairman Altimirano, under your leadership I hope we can reach a budget agreement to run the executive, judiciary and legislature efficiently, effectively and on flat budgets while increasing funding for our public schools, colleges and universities.
Let’s focus on our few real differences, resolve them quickly and adopt the budget all New Mexicans want.
5) Bank, don’t spend gaming revenues.
Right now we have millions of dollars of gaming revenue and I hope there will be millions more tomorrow.
But today’s continuing litigation makes tomorrow’s gaming revenue too uncertain to depend upon.
For the next twelve months, I challenge the legislature to put all gaming revenue into rebuilding state reserves, not into new government spending programs.
Members of the Forty-third Legislature, with these budget actions our citizens will win twice: We will have reformed welfare and Medicaid, overhauled our prisons, cut government bureaucracy, rebuilt our fiscal reserves and increased both higher education funding and public school accountability.
And we will have a common sense bonus that can be used to dramatically increase public school spending, improve roads and reduce taxes.
All of this can happen this year!
If the legislature will join me in passing a responsible budget, we can invest the common sense bonus in the future.
My investment plan will benefit both taxpayers and school children.
"My administration’s plan to restore our public schools is called ""For The Children’s Sake,"" and all legislators and thousands of citizens have it in front of them today."
Our plan challenges New Mexico schools, New Mexico students and New Mexico legislators to take a quantum leap forward in public education.
A quantum leap forward from a school system in which students start school too late, learn too little and drop out too soon to a system of life-long learners competing and winning in a changing global economy.
A quantum leap forward from a school system that offers students and parents only one school, one choice to a system with many choices and many winners.
A quantum leap forward from a school system whose share of revenue has decreased for more than a decade to a system that will see its share of revenue increase for more than a decade.
Our school reform agenda will guide New Mexico in taking this quantum leap forward by making six major changes: The first change is holding schools more strictly accountable for results.
Real results, like better test scores, higher graduation rates and greater school safety.
The second change is greater parental choice from pre-school through high school.
Our plan empowers 330,000 students and their parents to use the power of the marketplace to boost the power of learning.
The third change is to ensure that all students will be ready to learn by first grade.
Our students need a healthy start in life so they can get a head start in school.
The fourth change is that every student will be tested at every school, in every grade, every year.
Tested in math, tested in science, tested in reading and tested in writing.
The fifth change is school funding will increase as a percentage of the general fund.
Increased funding for teacher pay raises, increased funding for books and computers and increased funding for better schools.
And the sixth change is a guarantee to every parent that schools will be safe and students will be disciplined.
Parents demand and students deserve schools free of violence, vandalism, weapons and drugs.
These changes amount to a major rescue effort for our school system.
Our plan includes more than twenty specific initiatives and reforms to accomplish this rescue.
Ranging from charter schools to opportunity scholarships for kids; from a doubling in spending on school computers to a doubling in the number of annual exams.
Our plan means zero tolerance of school violence and partial repeal of the Little Davis Bacon Act as it applies to school projects.
Our plan means there will be a secretary of education, not a board of education.
And our plan will guarantee that half of every tax dollar you send to Santa Fe will get sent back to parents as an opportunity scholarship for you to spend, on your student, at the school of your choice!
Our education plan is bold and comprehensive.
But critics have attacked one part of our twenty point plan, the part that calls for parental choice.
However, parental choice is vital to improving our schools.
Parental choice means healthy competition among all our schools benefiting the children , not the administrators and bureaucrats who control them.
"Parental choice means our 330,000 students will be treated as consumers of education, rather than ""units of education"" to be manipulated like pawns on a chessboard. . Parental choice means between fifty and one hundred-fifty charter schools over the next five years."
Rather than the five charter schools that we have been limited to during the last few years.
Parental choice for tens of thousands of students, many who are at risk or poor, will mean an orderly five year transition from schools that too often fail them to schools of their choice that serve them.
And parental choice means every New Mexico student will receive a scholarship at the beginning of every school year ¾ an opportunity scholarship to attend any school in New Mexico!
Opportunity, competition and better schools ¾ that’s what parental choice means for New Mexico!
"Some may ask, ""Why parental choice?"""
As governor, as a parent of public school children and as a taxpayer, I offer two reasons why we must have greater parental choice in education: First, choice means competition, and in America competition works.
And it will work in our New Mexico schools.
Second, choice means change, quantum leap change.
Too many of our students lag too far behind; they are not competitive.
Something must be done.
For our children to compete in the global economy, our schools must be able to compete as well.
Here then, is my agenda for saving New Mexico’s schools, and my challenge to the legislature and to the public: More choice and greater accountability.
More testing and more funding.
Greater school safety and students ready to learn.
Rather than another laundry list of education reforms that promise much, cost a lot and deliver too little, I am proposing a plan that is realistic, fiscally sound and sure to improve our children’s education.
While public school students will receive the lion’s share of our new common sense bonus.
We must also share a part of it with New Mexico’s 700,000 hard-working taxpayers.
This is only fair.
New Mexicans pay taxes that are still too high for a government that is still too large and too expensive.
That has to change!
Accordingly, I am proposing a personal income tax cut of thirty-seven dollars for the average taxpayer, effective this year.
Our taxpayers work hard.
They pay far too much to the government in Santa Fe, and their families deserve a tax break.
Wouldn’t the common sense bonus of our more efficient state government be better spent by mothers and fathers on their children’s education or on their own retirement, than by the government, on more social programs?
Shouldn’t the government tighten its belt and take a little bit less out of your paycheck so that your family can keep a little more?
New Mexico’s taxpayers have waited long enough.
They have sacrificed enough, and they deserve tax relief now!
This July 1st let’s give a pay raise to all New Mexico workers by cutting their income taxes.
If a Republican Congress and a Democrat president can cut taxes, then a Democrat legislature and this Republican governor can do the same!
This is my plan for investing our bonus in our school children and our taxpayers.
The third, and final, challenge to this Forty-third Legislature is to take action now to create the common sense bonus of tomorrow.
Future bonuses will only result from changes made today.
Without continued vigilance — without continued cooperation from the legislature, there will be no bonus tomorrow.
But if we work together, the benefits will be enormous.
The common sense bonuses of tomorrow will mean: More tax relief and better government services; More and better infrastructure and jobs; And, better public schools, colleges and universities.
All of the changes we make today will mean a better quality of life tomorrow.
"I call my plan ""Bonus 2000."
"I propose ""Bonus 2000"" not as a package of legislation, but as a series of challenges."
Challenges to all New Mexicans: To my entire cabinet; To the legislature and judiciary; To all universities and all community colleges; To all Indian tribes, pueblos, and nations; To business and industry; And to all citizens.
I present these challenges today, to create quality of life bonuses for tomorrow.
Let us invest, not spend, this year’s $265 million of capital outlay funds.
Any new state spending should fit one of three basic requirements.
"Let us ask of any proposed capital outlay projects: ""Will it improve our schools?"""
"""Will it grow our economy?"""
"and ""Will it reduce crime?"""
"If the answer to any of these questions is ""yes,"" then let’s fund it; but, if the answer to all of these questions is ""no,"" then ask the question: ""Why fund it?"""
The education challenge is not limited to the elementary and secondary levels.
I challenge all boards of regents and boards of directors at every institution of higher learning to always pursue excellence, demand accountability, embrace distance learning, manage efficiently and graduate students who can compete in today’s economy.
The two keys to a greater New Mexico are an effective public education and a quality higher education.
I challenge my cabinet to prepare a zero growth budget for next year with all agency savings going to our public schools.
We have downsized the bureaucracy and reduced budget growth but, we can still do more and we can still do it better!
Smaller and more effective government will mean more and better schools.
I call upon the judiciary, the legislature, the attorney general and all other public officials to meet the same zero growth challenge with all of their agency savings going to improving our public schools.
"Let the flag that flies over Edward J. Lopez State Land Office Building and reads ""We Work for Education"" fly over every state building ""We Work for Education!"""
I challenge those in business and industry to become partners in the overhaul of our public schools, the reform of our welfare system, the rebuilding of our roads, the training of our workforce and the education of our children.
My final challenge is to all citizens: I challenge each and every one of you to renew your commitment to citizenship.
Get involved.
Do something to help your friends and neighbors and those you’ve never met who need nothing but a smile and a helping hand.
Don’t let excuses or cynicism get the best of you.
Recognize that little things do count; those small acts of charity and kindness that can brighten someone’s day — or even change their life.
Help a neighbor carry in her groceries.
Volunteer at the Boys Club.
Lead a Sunday school class.
Teach someone to read.
Be good to one another.
Nothing we do in Santa Fe — and, to tell the truth, nothing anybody does in Washington, D. C. — will have half the impact of those million small acts of citizenship that happen every day in New Mexico.
Our state is full of natural beauty.
Let’s behave beautifully too — and truly make this the Land of Enchantment.
"President Clinton put it this way: ""Today, we can declare government is not the problem and government is not the solution."
We, the American people, we are the solution.
You, the citizens of New Mexico, You are the solution.
Don’t let the naysayers stop you from being the solution.
You may recall, three years ago some said we couldn’t convert Medicaid to managed care, but we did.
Some said we would never really make government smaller or better, but we have.
Some said we could never build new privatized prisons or restore discipline to our inmates, but the prisons are under construction as we speak and inmate discipline is the rule, not the exception.
Some said we would never get four lane road projects up and going, but we have.
We can be proud of our progress, but we are far from done.
We must do more, much more.
We cannot wait for the president or Congress to act.
We cannot wait for other governors or other legislatures.
Our citizens can wait no longer.
If we fail to rescue our schools we will have failed our children.
If we fail to provide tax relief we will have failed our taxpayers.
If we fail to reform welfare we will have failed those most in need.
If we fail to meet any of these challenges we will have failed everyone .
I’m determined to fight for change.
I’m determined to fight for progress.
I’m determined to fight for new directions.
I challenge every citizen listening today to stand with me in this fight for our future.
Together, we can build a better New Mexico.
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless New Mexico.
