And to each of you .
my fellow Tennesseans.
I stand before you today, having just taken the oath of office, prepared to serve as your Governor.
I stand before you feeling both proud and humble.
Proud that you have chosen me to lead and humbled by the trust you have placed with me.
Most of all, I stand before you today believing that we are poised at a time of great opportunity and growth in Tennessee if we have the courage—and we will—to seize the moment.
Allow me a personal moment to thank a few very special people.
My wife, Andrea: I could have no better partner in life.
My son, Ben: I hope you know how proud we are of you.
My mother, Norma: You taught me the value of hard work and self-reliance.
And Mom, I’m still working on it.
And the countless Tennesseans who have embraced me as a friend, and made me the better for it.
To Governor Sundquist: I thank you for your long service to our State.
You always followed your convictions and, for that, I respect you.
When one campaigns for an office, there are Democrats and Republicans, there are supporters and opponents, there are communities where your support is strong and those that fall the other direction.
I want you to know that I hold to a fundamental principle.
When I raised my hand and took the oath of office a few minutes ago, those differences—Democrat and Republican, political friend and foe, big city and small town, East, West, Middle—all faded away and I became simply, without fear or favor, the Governor of all of the people of Tennessee.
We have been through some challenging times that were difficult for our governor, frustrating for our legislature, confusing—and in many cases, anger-provoking—for Tennesseans.
We are not the only state struggling through tough times.
But I believe as we have struggled we have fallen into the trap of seeing just two ways of looking at our government.
One way is the expansive view: More revenue, more responsibilities for government.
The second is a more restricted view: Cut expenses, fewer services.
But I want to say today that there is a third way.
Let’s leave behind the predictable and stale debate between liberals and conservatives.
Let’s take the resources that we have, and prioritize, and manage, and focus our energy on just doing things that count—on real results.
That third way is common sense, and it is already the way that families across our state are managing their own affairs and lives.
We all know families who are poor, families who are struggling to improve their situations.
We all know families who have plenty of money but cannot find happiness.
But Tennessee is full of families—rich and poor—who manage to achieve balance.
They use the resources they have, and add faith in God—love and commitment to each other—hard work and a focus on their children.
These are the real families, the families that work, the families that shine.
And that balance is the lesson for us.
That’s the third way for our government.
To stop arguing about money like some dysfunctional family and start setting priorities and bringing the ingenuity and focus that America is famous for in its businesses to the world of serving the public.
The third way is to set priorities.
We have to get control of the budget and TennCare, and the work of the next few months will largely be achieving this.
We have to get our economy growing and creating more and better jobs.
We will accomplish these goals.
But I want you to know that the first priority for me—what I want to be remembered for as Governor—is educating our children.
It is a very personal issue.
I grew up in a household with my mother and brother, who are here today, and with a grandmother and an Uncle Ozzie and Aunt Naomi, who have passed away.
My uncle Ozzie was a fine, intelligent man.
He worked as a baggage handler at a railway station and later as a milkman and a bookkeeper.
I feel sure Uncle Ozzie could have risen to great heights in business or public service.
But he never graduated from high school, never attended a college, never got all the tools that he needed to complement his God-given talents.
I learned from Uncle Ozzie.
My education commitment is simple.
I believe that every child is unique.
I’m going to work as hard as I know how, and I’m going to ask each of you to help me to offer all Tennessee children the education they need to energize their God-given talents to take them as far as they can go.
I know that we have some tough months ahead of us.
A budget crisis, again.
Problems with TennCare, again.
We’re going to get through it.
I don’t promise you instant results.
It will be like climbing a steep hill.
You put your head down and do it step by step.
Sometimes you slip back a step or two.
But when we get to the top—and we will—I know we are going to find a broad and bright landscape in front of us.
This is a hopeful time in Tennessee, full of promise and opportunity.
The people of our state are wonderful.
We love our communities and we work hard to make them even better.
Beginning today, we will work together to invent a third way.
To leave behind the tired debates.
To seize the opportunities that Providence has placed before us.
Let us dream.
And let us show our nation what the values and the work of Tennesseans can produce when we put our mind to it.
I am so proud to be your Governor.
Thank you, and Godspeed.
