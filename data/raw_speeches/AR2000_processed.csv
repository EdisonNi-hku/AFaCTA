SENTENCES
"First of all, I want to say a special word of thanks to all of you who have rearranged your schedules."
I know that for many of you this was not exactly what you had planned for this week.
But I do believe that what we're going to be about in these next few days surely is as important as anything that any of us originally had on our schedules this week.
"And if we do the people's business, and if we do it well, then we can all leave here, every single one of us, with a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that we will have done something that may forever change the hopes, the futures, the aspirations and the opportunities for our fellow Arkansans."
Medical care is a critical issue for all of us.
"The rising cost of prescription drugs, the challenge of being able to get access to a doctor and then finding a doctor, the real challenge of paying for him or paying for her."
"A man recently was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the doctor took his wife aside and said, ""Your husband is not doing well at all."
"In fact, I don't think he's going to make it.She said, ""That's terrible.Is there not anything?""He said, ""Well, yes, there is."
But what it's going to require is that you're going to have to cook very special meals for him.
"They're going to have to be prepared from scratch, no additives whatsoever, all organically grown foods."
And those meals are going to have to be on a very strict regimen that will be served five different times a day.
"In addition to that, he can do no work whatsoever.He can have no stress.You cannot argue with him."
He cannot pick up anything heavier than a magazine.
You'll have to make sure that there's not a bit of dust in the house.
You'll have to ensure that his life is just stress free in every respect.
And the only thing that really will help him beyond that is he needs an extraordinary level of passion from you.
And so she listened very carefully.
"And he said, ""Now, if you'll follow all of this, about six to eight months of this kind of treatment, he very well may live."
"Well, she went back to her husband."
"They got in the car and on the drive home he turned to her and said, ""Honey, what did the doctor say when he took you in that little room off to yourself?"""
"She looked over at him and said, ""He said you're going to die."
So many of us probably have figured out that health care is not an exacting science all the time.
"But one of the things that we all do is that we entrust health care to the doctors who have learned how to practice medicine, those who are trained in the healing arts."
"I want to remind all of us that when we closed our regular legislative session in 1999, I made a statement to you that I meant from the bottom of my heart."
"I told you that in 1997, when that session was over, it wasn't the most pleasant for me or for many of you who were here."
"And I said at the end of that session, I couldn't think of any reason on earth that I would ever recall that group back together."
But I said after the 1999 session that I couldn't think of any reason that I wouldn't call this group back together again.
"And I want you each to know that I meant that when I said it, and I mean it today."
Does that mean that we all agree on every aspect of what we're here to talk about this week?No.We never do.
135 elected people from every part of this state are rarely going to all agree on every bit of every bill.
It's just not the way the system works.
But the way the system works is we work with one another rather than against one another.
And we remind ourselves that we really do work for those people who entrusted these positions to us with their votes.
I come here today fully recognizing the fact that not a one of you from the House or the Senate work for me.I didn't elect you.Your people elected you.
Not one of you owe me anything.
"Oh, I can come around and remind you of ways that I helped when you asked, and I probably will do that before the week is over if I haven't already."
And you'll remind me of the times you voted for things that I asked you to vote for.That's how the system works.
But let there be no pretense whatsoever as we gather here today.You don't owe me anything.
I really don't have the power to strong-arm you into doing something here today because you don't work for me.
"You work for the people in your district, the people who elected you."
"They're the ones to whom you owe your vote this week, to whom you owe everything this week."
And I respect that and I understand that.
I want you to also know that I work for the same people you work for.
I have to run in every one of your 35 Senate districts and 100 House districts.
"It is true to say that every one of your constituents is also my constituent, and I feel very much a sense of responsibility and duty to making sure that what we do here this week we can do with a sense of making sure we do it with honor and that we carry out very faithfully our duty."
"And I just remind all of us that our duty is not to each other, not to anyone on the second floor, anyone on the third floor, but to the people who aren't even here today; the folks who got up this morning, fixed a sandwich, went out and tried to do the best they could to earn a living for their families."
I want us to take a look today as we begin this legislative session.We all know why we're here.
We're here to talk about what can we do with money that frankly we didn't really expect to fall our way.
This isn't money that we have come up with by taxing people.
"This is money that has come from a national settlement of a lawsuit filed against tobacco companies when it was finally discovered that after years and years of their marketing and their successful capacity to get people addicted to cigarettes, the health consequences have been so incredibly dramatic that the tobacco companies agreed to an unprecedented amount of payout to each of the states so that we could take that money and attempt to address some of the damage that has been done by the very product of cigarette smoking."
"Unlike many states who are doing everything from building roads and making all kinds of unique and rather creative uses of their money, from the very beginning the one thing that has sort of unified all of us has been the idea that we would use this money to address the very serious health care needs of the people of our state."
And I want to commend you as a body for having maintained throughout even the differences of opinion on aspects of this plan an overwhelming commitment to maintain that the focus of this session and the focus of a plan ought to address the health care needs of our fellow citizens who have been injured perhaps as much as any other citizenry of the United States by cigarette smoking.
Just recently a letter came across my desk from Mary Rodenbaugh.
"She is 71 years old, and she suffers from a serious disease which the doctors concluded was a direct result of her smoking for over 55 years."
Her business was lost when she was no longer able to work.
She went through her life savings because of the expensive medical bills she incurred and now she stands to lose her home because her medical bills have taken every last penny of her savings.
"She and her husband are now trying to sell their home just to pay for the treatments, which quite frankly have no promise at all of curing her disease, and she contacted our office and she said what can we do."
"Well, I want you to know that it is people like Mary that I want us to focus on this week because, frankly, she's the face of the tobacco settlement.Not me, not you."
Mary Rodenbaugh and thousands and thousands of Arkansans like her.
"In America, 420,000 people die every year directly because of cigarette smoking."
That is equivalent to six jet airplanes crashing and killing every single party every single day.
"To put it in perspective, more people will die from cigarette smoking in America this year than die from alcohol, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides all put together."
"For us to ignore this incredible, overwhelming problem would be irresponsible on our part."
But let's bring it home to Arkansas.
"In our own state, more than 540,000 of our fellow citizens smoke cigarettes."
We have one of the highest adult smoking rates in the nation with almost a third of our citizens lighting up every single day.
"The result is that our rates of death from heart disease, cancer and stroke are some of the highest in the nation."
"5,200 Arkansans die every single year from tobacco-related illnesses."
And the direct health care costs to this state -- this is a staggering figure that I want you to put in perspective -- it costs our state's citizens $500 million in medical treatment just for tobacco-related illnesses.
So let us not kid ourselves and say that this is something small.This is something huge.
"And obviously if I stood here today and announced that a tornado wiped out a community of 5,200 people, every one of us would have gathered here with tears in our eyes and we would have said we must work together to do something to rebuild that community and to do something for those people whose lives had been lost and their families."
"I say to you that something hits Arkansas every year that kills 5,200 people."
And it's up to us to do something about it.
We have a responsibility to go home having done something about it.
"For me, this is not a political issue, and I want you to understand that I know politics can't be removed from all this."
But neither of my parents are alive today because of smoking-related illnesses.
"I watched it take my strong father, who was a fireman, who was stout as an ox and make him weak from what it did to his heart."
"I watched what it did to my mother, to take her from a strong-willed, capable worker in an office, where she helped provide for our family the best way that she and my dad could, and I saw it destroy her health through a series of strokes, vascular diseases and surgeries that in the last years of her life rendered her far more the child than the mother until she died last year."
"My parents, neither of them, will ever see their kids have grandkids."
They will never see their grandchildren marry or graduate from college.And that's not unique to me.
"There's not a one of you in this assembly today, not one of you, without a story, an intensely personal story, of how the effects and the ravages of cigarette smoking have impacted your life and that of the people you love and care about."
"So whatever differences that we want to argue over this week and throughout this whole process, let us put aside some of those things that divide us for what ought to be a united fight to attack this disease that has attacked the people that we care about."
And let us responsibly look to the people of our state and give them a plan that we can support and they can support and that over the years will change the way health care is delivered in Arkansas.
"We have been through a long process, quite frankly."
"More than a year ago, I remember when Speaker Johnson, Jay Bradford, Mark Pryor and I stood together in a press conference."
"We announced that as a result of the national settlement, we would do all we could to commit ourselves to making sure that the money in Arkansas would be used for health care."
"And I want to say I think we still stand in agreement on that, and I think that has been significant."
I remember meeting with Dr. Harry Ward from UAMS and Dr. Fay Boozman from the Health Department.
I remember some of the early plans they presented.
"Some thought those plans were fixed in concrete, and if you looked at one of those today you would say, ""My gosh, it doesn't look anything like it did then."
The House conducted a series of hearings on its own.
No one from the executive branch and to my knowledge not a single person from the Senate was offended by or resented that the House asked its members to come in for a series of meetings and talk about how the money would be received and utilized and where the spending would go.
"I do know that a number of people from the executive branch attended those meetings faithfully to give input, ask and answer questions."
"And many people who were a part of what now is called the coalition, the Coalition for a Healthy Arkansas Today or the CHART group, were a part of those hearings."
"It was a process, a deliberative process, where anyone who wanted to could come and be a part."
We went through a period of debating whether or not we would have all the money put in a trust and whether we would have it all put in the securitization arrangement.Various plans were discussed.
"And throughout the process, legislators have been involved."
"Throughout that process, an emerging coalition developed."
It was not put together in a back room.
"It was put together in large measure by the natural result of people in the health care industry -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, health care providers, hospitals, people who deliver services out to the communities where all of you live -- sitting down together and talking."
I want to tell you those first meetings weren't very pleasant.
A lot of fussing and fighting was going on largely because everybody said we want this for us.
And it looked like it was going to go nowhere.
"And after a lot of wrangling and turf battling where everyone was trying to make sure that he or she got the most for his or her particular interest, it became apparent that this wouldn't really ever result in a plan."
"I think many of the responsible people from both the Legislature as well as the health care industry finally said, ""This isn't what we're about."
"We need to ask ourselves not what is in it for us, but what is in it for all the people of our state and what should we, in fact, do if we want to take a look at the real serious problems of the state of Arkansas as they relate to health."
"How can we best address those problems so that in 10 years and 25 years and in yet another generation we can honestly say we have changed health care and health for ordinary Arkansas citizens?""And from that a plan emerged."
Sixteen different meetings were held across the state by the coalition.
I want to remind you that those meetings were not all in Little Rock.
Legislators were invited to come and hear and have input on the plan.
"They were held where you live, out there in every part of the state."
"Folks got on a bus in the afternoons and drove to every corner of this state in order to answer questions and to present plans; plans, by the way, which changed as that whole process of 16 community-based meetings occurred."
About 50 legislators out of the 135 attended various meetings.
"Many raised significant questions.Some challenged things.Some agreed, some didn't.But there was a process."
A lot of modifications have happened.
The original plan didn't have any trust funds.
"Later, some trust funds were put in."
The plan that is presented this week that will be introduced in legislation is a plan now that is frankly improved because legislators participated in the discussion.
"Because of that, a front-loaded trust means that there will be enough money in that trust that over time, even if the tobacco money quits paying out, there will still be money to continue funding those programs."
I know most of you don't believe everything you read in the newspapers; I don't either.
"There have been things said like, ""The Governor will not make any changes in the plan."
"Well, I need to address that because I want to make sure you don't have any misunderstanding about what I've actually said."
"Folks, this plan has had enough changes in it that that statement on its face would be untrue.But I would say this."
"My position all along has been that any change we make, it ought to be made with the justification that it improves the overall delivery of health care to Arkansas citizens, not whether it makes any of us, whether it's me or any of you, look better politically.That's irrelevant."
"I want to talk about the plan, but let me say as an aside there is something we've added to the call."
I'm sure you're aware of it by now and maybe it's the right time to address it since we're going to be here this week talking about changing the health care of Arkansas citizens and talking about spending $1.6 billion out there to deal with tobacco-related illnesses.
I listened to lot of what many of you have told me.
"Last Friday when we issued the call, I wasn't too sure about adding an item on the call this week."
"But after a rather significant feedback from a significant number of you, we have added an item on the call."
That item is going to be that we eliminate smoking from this building where we work and we do it for no other reason than it's a good example to set.
"After all, you may remember you passed and I signed a bill that banned smoking on every school campus in every school district in the state."
"We told not only the kids, we told the teachers they couldn't smoke on the campus."
"And then they bring busloads of kids and haul them up the steps, and they have to hold their breath getting through the hallways because of the smoke in here."
I think it's the right thing to do and the right time to do it.
"It's your choice this week, but enough of you wanted to do it so we're going to do it."
"I want to talk about the plan, but I don't want to go into the specifics because you're going to get plenty of that as you meet in various committees and you'll have all the time to go over it."
And I promise you there are a lot more people that know a lot more about the specifics of the plan than I do.
But let me emphatically tell you something.This is not my plan.
"Now, I can't help it that the newspapers keep calling it the governor's plan."
You should know by now if you read most of the stories about me that I didn't write them.
I would have written them differently.
And I can't help it that sometimes this whole process has been characterized as the governor's plan.
I have said at every news conference I attended and every speech I made regarding this issue that this is not my plan.
And I said I'm not smart enough to have developed this plan.
I've never been to medical school.
I'm not a public health official.
"I don't have a degree in pharmacy, nursing, dentistry or in surgery, and a lot of you better be darn glad of it, too."
"I don't think you would want to trust your life to me.I wouldn't, either."
"This is a joint effort of health care professionals, senators, House members and 200 organizations representing virtually every health care entity in this state."
There are several elements I think are very important.
"The first is an appropriation of a responsible trust of $100 million which, with the front loading as I mentioned, will have a significant capacity to ensure that there will be money to make these programs work for perpetuity."
The second aspect is it will allow access to health care for more Arkansans than ever before.
"A couple weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit with a young, very dynamic cardiologist here in Little Rock, Dr. Anthony Fletcher."
"I want to tell you something, I was moved by our conversation.Let me tell you why."
"Dr. Fletcher sat across from me and described that how, as a minority physician in this state, what bothered him more than anything else was that his patients would come with serious heart diseases and he would be trying to tell them what they needed to do to save their lives."
And they were more concerned and burdened with how they were going to pay for their medical treatment than what their medical treatment entailed.
"As I listened to his passion, it occurred to me that one of the things that ought to be driving us this week is the fact that there are many of our fellow citizens who can afford to die easier than they can afford to go to the doctor, and one of aspects of this plan is making access available to more citizens."
Part of it is a Medicaid expansion.
Some would say we ought to have more.That's an arguable point.
"One of the things that I feel is good in the plan is there is an expansion of the Medicaid program, which I support."
But there is also a recognition that if all we do is pour more money into the immediate health crises of our citizens and we do not address the long-term reasons why these are crises -- if all we do is just pour money at the immediate issue before us but do nothing to change the trend -- we can't raise enough Medicaid money now or with 10 settlements to face the health care needs for the coming generations.
"So it behooves us to take a balanced approach with access, and we have done that."
"Many of you have been concerned, and rightfully so, about your rural hospitals."
And those of you in urban areas have been concerned about your urban hospitals.
"With the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997 in the Congress, it's a federal issue and not the state's doing."
But the fact that Congress has done some of the things they have done in Washington has put this onerous burden upon us and has made it tough for many hospitals to continue functioning.
We don't have enough to fix it all.
"But there is a piece to make sure that money will flow from the tobacco settlement to help all the hospitals, not just the rural ones in Arkansas, but all of them as it should be."
And I want to say something for those of you for whom hospitals are a critical issue.Please understand this.
"The day I sign a bill, that very day, we apply for increased funding for our hospitals and it will be backdated to the day on which the bill was passed."
Immediately the one thing we can start affecting is money flowing to the hospitals.
But I also want you to remind you of this.
"If you're tempted to have us walk away from here with nothing, you will go back to your communities with the stark reality that every day we don't pass something is a day your hospitals are still looking for those additional dollars."
We want to administer prevention and cessation programs.
That's an important part of the plan.
"Now there's a way to do that that's responsible, and that's to follow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines."
"Frankly, I don't think it's responsible for us to do anything less than that because to do so means that we would be investing in a project that won't work."
"On the other hand, if we follow the guidelines of the CDC, we are investing in a process that is proven to work."
I have to agree with Dr. Fay Boozman.
I read his quote in the newspaper.
It's about as profound as Fay will ever get.
"He said it's a whole lot better to kill snakes than to treat snakebites.And Fay, you're right."
That's why prevention and cessation is an integral part of this.
"We also want to advance research, and that's an important part."
"Let me be very honest in telling you today that when the plan first started emerging and I heard about research, that was a part that I said, ""Oh, that's not something that we need to be involved in."
Let me also confess to you today I've never been more wrong in my life.
"And I'm telling you, I didn't start there."
But today I'm absolutely of a deep conviction that there's probably nothing in this entire plan that is more important than investing in long-term research for a host of reasons.
"I grew up in Hope, and I'll tell you in our hospital down there they have never done a heart transplant.You know something?I doubt they ever will."
I own property over in Pike County.
I remember when Steve Faris and Gus Wingfield asked us to see if we could help them with a few thousand dollars to help them get an X-ray machine because they were about to lose the only one they had in the little Pike County hospital.
And we helped them with an X-ray machine.
"It wasn't a whole lot of money, but it was a big deal."
"The truth is, they are not going to do bone marrow transplants at that Pike County hospital."
I'm grateful that a person who lives in my hometown of Hope or in Pike County or lives in your county is not limited to having to go to the Mayo Clinic or to Boston or to Houston in order to get the first-class world class kind of treatment that will save his or her life.
It is a heck of a lot easier for a family to get to Little Rock than to get to Boston or Rochester.
And the reason that has happened is because research dollars have made it possible for us to attract the kind of medical technology that takes a back seat to nobody's.
I think we sometimes forget what a wonderful treasure we have in our medical school here.
"I remember 12 years ago when I was a pastor in Texarkana, a little girl in our church named Jill was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor deep in her brain."
There were only two places in the world where she could get treatment.
One was in Europe where a procedure using a process called a gamma knife was developed.
"The other was in North Carolina, which at the time had the only other gamma knife in the world."
It was a very sophisticated device that would attack deeply embedded brain tumors that were unreachable by traditional surgery.
We gathered enough money to get Jill and her family flown to North Carolina because that was a heck of a lot cheaper than getting them to Europe.
Jill is a student today in one of our colleges here in Arkansas.
"She will graduate in two years and will live a normal, healthy life."
"And if you saw her you would never know, not one moment that a few years ago her prognosis was that she might not live unless she could get to that gamma knife."
"You may not be aware of it, but last year Arkansas at UAMS installed a gamma knife."
"And if that today had happened to Jill, she wouldn't have to worry about going to Europe or to North Carolina."
She would just get to Little Rock and our own doctors right here in this state would offer her treatment that she would never have had access to apart from the research dollars.
"Some of you may say, ""Well, if I live in rural Arkansas, what does that matter to me?""My friend, it's so obvious."
Who trains those doctors who serve in those rural communities?
Who trains the nurses who work in the nursing homes who care for our elderly parents?
Who trains the pharmacists who fill the prescriptions that we all know are too high but yet save lives and give quality of life that otherwise they would never have?
Who trains the paramedics and EMSs who ride on the ambulances that do work in our rural hospitals?I'll tell you who does it.
"The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences campus, that's who does it."
"And if we don't have a strong medical school, we don't have strong doctors."
"If we don't have a strong medical school, we don't have good nurses."
"If we don't have a strong medical school, we don't have good pharmacists."
"And if we don't have good research, you can't attract the kind of professors to that medical school that will give us the good school, that will give us the good doctors, that will give people in rural Arkansas the kind of health care they're asking you to help them have.It's that simple."
"And speaking of UAMS, I want to say something."
"I know there has been a lot of publicity directed to UAMS, and I want to just go on record."
"Twenty-one years ago, Dr. Harry Ward, his wife Betty Joe and five children came to this state."
Dr. Ward took on the responsibility of the University of Arkansas med school.
"Under his leadership of two decades, it has become a nationally recognized university and hospital."
"As a result of his leadership, today we have the Arkansas Cancer Research Center."
We have the Jones Eye Institute.
"We have the Donald Reynolds Center for Aging, the first and only of its kind in the world.We have the Harry Ward Tower."
We have the family medical center.
We have area health education centers across the state.
I don't know if Harry Ward is here today.
I don't know if he is up there in the gallery.I was hoping he would be here.
"If he is, Harry, I hope you'll hear it."
"If you're not, I hope you'll hear about it."
But let me on behalf of this Legislature and the people of Arkansas extend a hearty thanks for your leadership of 21 years of an outstanding medical school that has brought pride and distinction to the state of Arkansas.
"Gosh, I don't even know if Harry voted for me or not."
But I wanted to say those things because I really believe them and in how that translates into our everyday lives.
"Not long ago, Dr. Gazi Yasargil from UAMS, who is a microneurosurgeon, was named man of the century -- a pretty incredible honor, isn't it?"
-- by the Congress of Neurosurgeons.
"He pioneered the development of neurosurgery resulting not only in less pain by patients but greater recovery rates.Somebody says, ""Well, so?"""
"Well, tell that to Danny Nut because Dr. Yasargil is his doctor, and Danny Nut today has a good outlook that he might not have had if it had not been for the work at UAMS."
Dr. John Dornhoffer is the director of the division otology.
He developed the pioneer procedure that has a dramatic impact on hearing.
"What used to take two surgeries that cost $10,000 has now been reduced to one surgery for half that amount, saving the 200 patients a year on which he performs this surgery $1 million every year."
And how much does it cost to have him?
"Not nearly $1 million, and that's how much money he saves the people of this state whose money would have gone to pay for more expensive medical care.It's a wonderful environment."
Dr. Bart Barlogie has developed cell vaccination.
It actually helps the patient's immune system to prevent recurrences of malignancies.
"He performs the greatest number of bone marrow and stem cell transplants in the nation, right here in Arkansas at your medical school."
"And if you saw Frank Oldham, who just recently finished his term of 10 years on the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, you might go up to Frank and ask him, ""What is the value of research and the value of a good medical school?"""
Frank might tell you that it was worth his life because he was one of Dr. Barlogie's patients.
And what about one of the components of research as it relates to agriculture?
"Well, the foods we eat and the plants that we grow are directly related to good health as well as to the development of medicine."
"Many of you come from rural Arkansas, and I don't have to tell you that your farmers are struggling."
Some of them went out of business last year.
"Unless some things change significantly, a lot of your farmers in your districts will be going out of business this year."
Now how in the world does the tobacco settlement and a health plan have an impact on them?I'll tell you how.
Because the fact is that the agricultural research gives us the capacity to begin changing the way crops are grown to make them more marketable and profitable so your farmers can make more money and maybe survive.
It's also a fact that some of the things that will be done with those products will prove to be the medicinal cures that will save the lives of the citizens of your district.
"If there's any group of people in this entire state who ought to be emphatically behind this proposal, I tell you it ought to be the folks from farming communities because they probably are going to benefit as much if not more than anyone."
I want to talk about accountability for a moment because I believe one of the key components of this entire proposal developed by the coalition is its evaluation and accountability.
"And, by the way, anything that doesn't work out the way you think it should, if I were you and I voted for it, I'd say, ""Look, I'll vote for it but by golly I want to keep my eyes on it and if it doesn't perform, we will go in the next session and we will change it.You can do that."
"If you find something doesn't work, then by golly change it the next time, but for gosh sakes let's not walk out of here without a plan."
Let's walk out of here with a plan we can change rather than walk out of here without a plan.
"And when we do that, let's be reminded that the cash funds which are established in this have been established to have the strictest controls of any I think you'll ever find."
"If you don't believe me and my statement, talk to Jimmie Lou Fisher or her deputy Harold Criswell or talk to state auditor Gus Wingfield."
Ask him of his confidence in the system and how it has been set up.
Talk to Dick Barclay and the people at DF&A.
"And I'll tell you if you look at it, you'll see the strictest controls that have ever been placed on those kinds of accounts."
We can accelerate help to a lot of our urgent needs.I mentioned rural hospitals.Some say I want more.
But your hospital association representing your hospitals supports the coalition plan.
"You can go back home having voted for it and say, ""I did what you asked me to do."
"If you go home without a plan, I'm not sure how that goes over."
Some talked about Meals on Wheels.
But the people who support and actually deliver Meals on Wheels support the coalition plan.What about our local college?
We have a lot of them in Arkansas.
But the presidents and chancellors of virtually every college and university in this state support the coalition plan.Minority health needs?
"I'm proud to say not only does the Minority Health Commission support it, but yesterday a very significant endorsement by the Arkansas Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Association, made up of the health care providers from the minority community, fully endorsed the coalition plan."
"I tell you, I believe it's a pretty compelling argument that the people who have been responsible for delivering health care to you and to your family and your friends have given you all the reason in the world and all the comfort in the world to justify your vote.But it's also about posterity."
"The number of Arkansas youth who are alive today who will eventually die from smoking if the current trends continue and we don't do anything about prevention and cessation will be 49,000."
That's the number of today's teenagers who will die from smoking.
"Forty-three percent of the high school students in the state smoke regularly, well above the national average."
"What we have to do is decide if we want to come here this week and walk away from this session, whenever it ends, having delivered to the people who elected us a plan that we can live with but more importantly that we can live with better than we have ever lived."
"I want to tell you, I don't want you to do this for me.It's not about me."
"Not one person in the House or the Senate ought to come up and say, ""Governor, I'm going to vote for this for you.You're not doing it for me."
"I hope also you wouldn't come up and say, ""We're voting against it because of you."
"That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, either.It's not about me.Frankly, it's not about you."
"It's about those people out there we represent, that we are responsible for and responsible to."
God help us if we let this turn into a battle between the House and the Senate or the legislative and the executive branches of government.
May God forgive us if we let this become some big political fight that we all try to have pride of authorship in saying we did it or if we all at the end of it somehow try to claim that we got our fingerprints all over it.
"If it were possible, and I don't guess it is, I would love to say, ""Take my name, my fingerprints off of it."
"I tried best I could because I said over and over, ""It's not my plan.I support it.I endorse it."
I'm going to do everything I can to see it pass.
But I can't claim any of the credit for its passage because I didn't design it.
A lot of you had a big hand in helping design it.A lot of members of the House.
A lot of members of the Senate.
You worked with people from across the state.
"There are some people who are going to absolutely vote for it, and there is nothing you can do to change their vote."
"Some are determined they are going to vote against it, and there is nothing we can do to change their vote."
"There are a whole lot of people who say, ""Man, I just want to come out of here with something."
I call it the Rodney King school of politics.Can't we just all get along?I hope we can.
"I would propose that if you're one of those folks who can't decide to vote for plan A or plan B, vote for both of them."
"If there's plan C and D, vote for those, too."
Just vote for everything that comes up that will improve health care in Arkansas.
"At least you can say you worked hard and you tried and you wanted to do something so that you didn't go home facing those folks in the coffee shops next week or whenever it may be and say to them, ""We didn't get anything done."
"Folks, there's too much at stake."
James Jaggers in Clarksville made an appointment with a dermatologist after discovering a spot on his head.
"He was diagnosed with a stage three melanoma, the same thing that killed my father.It spread to his lymph nodes.He went to UAMS for treatment."
The standard treatment didn't help his condition.
"But because of some of the research at that institution, he had six treatments and saw tremendous benefits."
"There were no side effects, and today he is a living, breathing person, alive because of that treatment, because of the research at that hospital."
"In Sheridan -- Jim Lancaster has been one of the strong supporters of this plan -- because John Walker, diagnosed with skin cancer in 1994, had treatment at UMAS, he lived."
"Here in Little Rock, Evelyn Howell, in 1996 was diagnosed with breast cancer.It had already spread."
"High doses of chemotherapy were delivered, but the cancer spread to other parts of her body."
"But as a result of clinical trials developed right here at our medical school, the treatment started working and she went into remission.Her prognosis is good."
"In Monticello, Peggy Echols, a breast cancer victim, is a person who because of research was given new medication resulting in a new prevention program."
And there are many women in Arkansas who as a result of some of the unique research and therapies that were developed right here in our state in our medical school by our doctors aren't going to die.
They're going to be alive because money was allocated to make it possible for them to live.Those are your people.
Elaine Thompson from Siloam Springs was diagnosed with liver cancer.
Allen Clark in Hot Springs was diagnosed with bone cancer and had a bone marrow transplant that saved his life.
Now he is building up immunity to cancer cells.
Nicky Hargrove of Stuttgart was diagnosed with lung cancer.
A new drug administered as a result of the research at UAMS attacked the living cancer cells and reduced the side effects of the traditional therapies.
"Hugh Miller from Mountain Home has pancreatic cancer, a disease that is very difficult to diagnose early."
"Because of the innovations developed right here in our state by our medical school and by our doctors, he now has an excellent prognosis."
June Lewis of Greenwood was diagnosed with intestinal cancer.
Research pioneered ways in which nutrition therapy helped block the cancerous growth.
"And from Maumelle, there is Shelby Brown, a native Arkansan."
Shelby started smoking when she was a little girl because in those days it was the hip thing to do.Movie stars smoked.Heroes smoked.
"She thought it was OK. And so for most of her adult life, she took up a habit that many of your families took up as well."
"Shelby worked at our own Arkansas Department of Health for 13 years until she was diagnosed with lung cancer, later with throat cancer, later with esophagus cancer.Three cancers in four years."
"But through the help of the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, through the care of her doctors, her family and the prayers of her church, she's a survivor."
And I wanted to tell you her story today because Shelby is here with us.
"Now you think about what you do this week, how you vote and how you argue and fight and all the things we're going to go through."
I want you to remember it's not about me and it's not about you.
It's about people like Shelby Brown.
"And Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, with your permission, I'd like to ask Shelby if she would come and stand beside me."
And I want you to meet Shelby Brown from Maumelle who today is a member of what's called the lost cords club.
"And as a result of her being a part of that, she goes to schools and to Cub Scout troops and she talks to kids about why they don't need to smoke."
I want her to just stay a word to you.
"I've asked her just to say something and tell us why this is important.Shelby.Thank you, Shelby."
"Shelby, I want to thank you and your husband, Allen, for being here today.You've been through a lot."
It takes a lot of courage to come and face this body.
I can tell you from having done it.
But it takes more courage that you go out and let folks know that it does matter.
And I'm grateful that we have a medical school and a research hospital that helped you.It makes you alive today.
Let's pray that kids like your grandson will never take up a habit that will end up doing so much damage to them.
I've tried since I was a college student every day to read a chapter in Proverbs.
It's just sort of a good way to get a day started.
"And today in Proverbs Chapter 3:27-28, there was something more appropriate than anything I could have ever thought of.I want to close with it."
I hope you'll let it sink in and you'll think about it long and hard over the next hours and days.
"Proverbs 3:27-28 says, ""Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it is in your power to act."
"Do not say to your neighbor, 'Come back later."
I'll give it tomorrow' when you now have it with you.
"My friends, we have good in our hands."
We have money that we didn't even have to take from their pockets in taxes.They deserve it.It is in our power to act.
"Let us not tell the people of this state, ""Come back later, we'll do it tomorrow.We'll do it next year.Instead, we have it now.Let's do it now."
Let's make this state proud of what happens in this Capitol.
"Let's make its people look at us with the respect that you are due as elected representatives, and let's look in the eyes of Shelby Brown and tell her we have not come down here this week to fight each other."
"We have come down here this week to fight for you and those like you.Thank you, and God bless you."
