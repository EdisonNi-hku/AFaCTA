SENTENCES
"Good evening, fellow Hoosiers, colleagues and friends."
"Speaker Gregg, Senator Garton, Representative Mannweiler, Senator Young, Chief Justice Shepard and Judge Sharpnack, leaders all, thank you for hosting me in this joint session."
It is an honor to have Governors Bayh and Orr join us as well.
"I will be working closely with my partner, Lieutenant Governor Joe Kernan, who serves as director of our Department of Commerce."
"I've asked him to review all State job creation efforts, for the expansion of existing business as well as the attraction of new ones."
"Some of you may know that Joe recently had hip replacement surgery, and that new hip was made right here in Indiana.Made in Indiana."
"When it comes to job creation, Joe told me, he not only talks the talk, he -- literally -- walks the walk.We're lucky to have him."
It is a privilege and a pleasure to join you tonight in this chamber.
"We have come together at a auspicious moment in our State's history, a time of opportunity and progress, unparalleled in a generation."
All of you in this room can feel justly proud.
"Indiana's economy and fiscal outlook owe their strength, at least in part, to the General Assembly's partnership with the Bayh-O'Bannon administration."
"Our state budget surplus, the creation of a record number of new jobs, fewer people on welfare now than in 1972, higher ISTEP scores, unprecedented high school graduation rates, more people going on to higher education."
"Building on these achievements over the next four years, we can reach the next level in Indiana."
"Tonight, I am going to lay out my road map for getting us where we want to be at the dawn of the next century."
"Making Indiana an even better place to live, work and raise a family -- a goal I know we share."
What I have to say tonight won't surprise anyone who paid close attention to last year's contest for governor.
Lieutenant Governor Kernan and I ran on an ambitious agenda to continue moving Indiana forward: From dramatic school improvement through local control and accountability to our tax cut for working families.
"Our agenda is grounded in common sense, Hoosier values: family, faith, community, the belief that opportunity and responsibility go hand in hand, an optimism that we can overcome any obstacle -- together."
"Growing up in Corydon, our first State Capital, I understood that government is no abstraction -- it's us."
"And, as our State constitution says, ""all power is inherent in the people""."
We have the power to bring out the best in our state -- the best in us.
The power to shape Indiana's destiny and our children's future.Let's use it well.
"In crafting this program we've balanced public investments -- first class schools, new roads, more police, crime prevention and prison space -- with tax cuts that return money directly to Hoosier families."
"We can do all of this and leave the State surplus close to a billion dollars, a prudent reserve for any changes in the economy or unforeseen circumstances."
"First, every action we take in this building must pass a simple test: does it leave our children and grandchildren better prepared for tomorrow?"
"When it comes to my Administration, that question applies across the board to each and every policy area -- whether we're talking about job creation, safer communities or welfare-to-work."
At the root of it all is first class schools.
"Education, training and retraining prepare Hoosiers to be the most they can be."
"Education binds our society together, enabling each and every one of us to give something back to the community."
"Tonight, I ask you to join me in making dramatic changes in State education policy, the 21st Century School Improvement Plan."
Our initiative is a sweeping overhaul that combines far greater local control with higher standards and accountability for results.
Let me tell you what a difference it will make.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this book contains the regulations the State imposes on every Indiana Public School."
It's a wonder students ever learn anything when regulations bog schools down in bureaucracy.
"Among other changes, the 21st Century School Improvement Plan will cut the size of this book in half."
And I hope our bold move will encourage local school corporations to reduce their regulatory burden on individual schools as well.
"For example, did you know that our State regulations require that a minimum of two percent of a school building ""be set aside for general storage"" -- including ""shelving, racks, bins and other devices?"""
"According to this book, a reception area and conference room are mandated for high schools, though optional for primary and middle schools."
"And, in case you were wondering, high school ""business education"" areas must provide a minimum of 30 square feet per pupil, unless it's a ""typing room"" or ""an office practice lab."
"This book says they have to have 35 and 40 square feet per pupil, respectively."
It's time to end this absurd micromanagement and focus on what really matters: improving student achievement.
"There are a lot of wonderful schools in Indiana, with a lot to share."
And their success is largely due to local decision-making.
"A partnership of students and parents, teachers and administrators, and the community at large."
Sometimes it's a formal process: the Chauncey Rose Middle School in Terre Haute has a school improvement committee.
Chauncey Rose's achievements show us that local-based leadership is essential for improved student achievement.
Our challenge at the State level is to foster that innovation and creativity in every school.
Local control must go hand in hand with accountability for higher performance.
"But no longer will we dictate from Indianapolis what schools in New Albany, Fort Wayne or Logansport must do to meet those standards.It's just common sense."
"Unfortunately, too much of our State's education policy just isn't."
I ask your enthusiastic support for the 21st Century School Improvement Plan.
"This new approach to State education policy will require that the Department of Education take on a new mission: rather than monitoring schools for regulatory compliance, it will mentor them to meet higher standards."
"I am looking forward to working with Superintendent Reed as we transform her department into a corps of master teachers committed to change, local decision-making and excellence."
Meeting higher school standards is impossible without discipline.
"No child can learn if he's under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or in a classroom that a teacher can't control."
"We can't give up on any child, but nothing else matters if we can't get a handle on these problems."
Local school corporations are having some success with alternative schools for youth with a history of violent or disruptive behavior.
"These tough programs are proof that, with the right guidance, troubled young people can turn their lives around."
And we must lift the burden of textbook rental costs off the shoulders of public school parents.
"Through increased State aid to local schools, we can put Indiana in the mainstream of the 50 states, most of which already cover schoolbook costs."
Parents who have three children in school can be paying almost $200 per year for books they'd have without cost in Michigan or Illinois.
"That makes no sense, and I urge your support for free textbooks."
"And, finally, in higher education, I have submitted legislation to reward academic achievement, make college more affordable, and strengthen our work force at the same time."
I am calling for a plan to forgive college loans for those with at least a B average in high school.
"For our state to compete in the global economy, more Hoosiers must -- at the very least -- have college degrees."
"The Hoosier Education Loan Program for Scholars -- or HELPS -- will encourage good students to get their diplomas, stay in Indiana, and raise their families here."
"That's a great investment in their future, and ours.Let me now turn to taxes."
Indiana must have a tax structure that strengthens our economy as we move into the 21st Century.
"Accordingly, in the next few weeks I will appoint a Citizens Commission on Taxes."
"This group, including Hoosiers from all walks of life and corners of the state, will examine our entire tax structure, top to bottom."
"Everything is on the table, from our assessment system to eliminating whole categories of taxation."
Overhauling our tax system cannot be done piecemeal in a politically charged atmosphere.
We must have time to look at the issues -- the many issues -- together.
"Not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Hoosiers.That's just common sense."
But Hoosier families need real tax relief -- now.
And my plan provides it at a time when we can afford it.
"It's targeted to working families and retirees, who now pay the highest percentage of their income in state and local taxes."
"Our plan has four parts: First, we're extending a state income tax credit for families, equal to a percentage of the property taxes they pay each year."
"The credit will vary, depending on the homeowner's annual income."
"Second, we increase the State renter's tax deduction by $1,000 a year."
"After all, renters pay property taxes too -- in the form of higher rent when landlords pass along their property tax costs."
So renters would also get a tax cut as part of our plan.
"Third, we provide a welfare-to-work income tax credit for families making less than $10,000 a year."
This is especially important because it helps work pay more than welfare and benefits that go with it.
"Fourth, we tighten the cap on the amount property taxes can increase locally."
This part of our plan would save Hoosier families and businesses more than $200 million over the next four years.
We can still get Hoosier families the tax relief they need in this session -- a first step toward broader changes in the system -- while the Citizens Commission on Taxes does its important work.
I will work closely with the General Assembly on this area of great concern to us all.
"Next, to another of our State's most urgent investment needs: new road and highway construction."
"Indiana is known as the ""Crossroads of America"" for our excellent highway transportation network."
My transportation construction plan -- Crossroads 2000 -- will ensure that we have a first class highway system well into the next century.
"By using $54 million in gasoline sales tax revenue, we can raise more than $400 million for Crossroads 2000."
"Although gas sales tax revenue now goes into the General Fund, I have long believed those funds should be seen as a user fee paid by motorists for road maintenance and improvement."
It just makes good economic sense.
It's no secret that economic development follows infrastructure.
"We've invested $3 billion in roads since 1989, and cut administrative costs at the Department of Transportation to put more money into construction."
But staying competitive for the future requires nothing short of our bold Crossroads 2000 program.
"Let me turn now to another area where investment for the future is critical: completing the transformation of public assistance, from a handout to a hand up."
"Due to both State and federal action, welfare as we've known it is history."
"Over the past three years, Indiana has led the nation in moving people from welfare to work."
Our public assistance rolls are the lowest they've been since 1972.
The changes we've made in the program have been grounded in personal responsibility and the work ethic.
"With the progress we've made over the past three years, I have targeted several areas to keep needy Hoosiers moving from dependency to self-sufficiency."
"For example, we must help people formerly on welfare keep their new jobs by providing them vouchers for transitional services like child care, transportation, housing and even work clothes."
Local non-profit groups and churches will have a key role to play here.
And it is essential that we encourage employers to hire people on welfare.
My Administration will be working with employers all over the state on welfare-to-work initiatives.
"Just last week, Lt. Governor Kernan and I announced an innovative effort with Pep Boys, an auto parts distributor."
"Of the 150 new jobs Pep Boys is working to create, it is targeting 60 of those slots for people now on public assistance."
"With these changes and others, I believe we'll be strengthening Indiana's safety net, to protect those truly in need."
"We will be restoring public confidence that their tax dollars are supporting responsibility and opportunity, as well as helping people in tough times."
"Again, common sense, Hoosier values."
Which brings us to safer communities.
Any discussion about tackling our crime problem -- whether focused on punishment or prevention -- is fundamentally about values and communities.
"When I was elected Lt. Governor eight years ago, my wife Judy and I moved from Corydon to a house in downtown Indianapolis."
We wanted to be part of a diverse community that was in the process of self-renewal.
The Old Northside turned out to be a wonderful experience for us.
And it gave us both insight into what it takes to build a safer Indiana.
"We found that when people joined together, shared experiences, began to understand and trust one another, things improved."
"Folks came out from behind their doors of fear, prejudice and irresponsibility."
They came together as a neighborhood.
"Through community gardens, tutoring programs, crime watches and a housing initiative, people began to rebuild both their lives and the Old Northside."
"It included all of us -- churches, the police, development corporations, service centers, adults and youngsters alike."
"And, lo and behold, crime decreased."
"In a surprising way, the police have been an integral part of community renewal in the Old Northside."
"They have worked with us on community celebrations, housing improvement, and anti-drug efforts."
Officers who become a part of the areas they serve deter crime.
"Robert Kennedy once said that ""every community gets the kind of law enforcement it insists on."
"As governor, I will insist on more police throughout this state."
And I will encourage more community policing.
Those of us who grew up in small towns remember the sheriffs who knew everyone and could anticipate and stop crime -- before it happened.
"I've seen this work in the Old Northside, too."
Our shared values put into practice for a safer Indiana.
"Right now, there are about 10,000 sworn police officers in regular police departments throughout the state."
"I propose to increase that by five percent -- 500 new police officers on the beat over four years, in our streets, on our roads, in our neighborhoods."
We do -- and will -- need more prison space.
"We need another medium security facility right away with 1,400 beds, and we'll need even more space soon."
"Despite national reports of decreasing violent crime, in the coming years we project that the Indiana State prison population could increase as much as five percent a year from the current population of almost 18,000 inmates."
"Once someone breaks the bonds that hold us together, he must pay for his act."
A violation of anyone's personal security violates us all.
That's a value those of us who govern the Hoosier state are charged to uphold.And we will.
"Governing is, of course, our highest public trust."
"Fortunately, Hoosiers have never granted it lightly."
"Our constituents demand much from us -- hard work, fiscal prudence, our best impartial judgment, integrity."
"The skyrocketing cost of political contests in Indiana is threatening our bond with the people, and we must act to restore their confidence."
Campaign finance reform must be enacted by this General Assembly.
"Other issues, too, will claim our attention."
Battling the scourges of racism and sexism.
Retaining excellence in our universities.
"Reforming our child welfare system, and increasing home care choices for older, infirm Hoosiers."
Making affordable health insurance more accessible.
Ensuring the future of Medicaid.
Making the prevailing wage law more workable.
"Protecting our environment, and curbing out-of-state waste."
Continuing to help create good jobs at good wages.
"Finally, let me close with an issue I care very much about: community service -- giving something back to the people around you."
A crucial ingredient in safer communities and a stronger Indiana.
"Judy and I, as well as Joe and Maggie Kernan, know community service is a way of life."
"My administration will lead both by example and by policy, encouraging Hoosiers to put our values into action helping others."
Nothing inspires me more than seeing the miracles people can perform when they reach outside themselves.
"Everyone knows about the inspiring work of the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Boy and Girl Scouts, the YM and YWCA."
"But you may not know that the Reverend Mozel Sanders Thanksgiving Dinner in Indianapolis draws over 1,000 volunteers every year to distribute 25,000 meals to people who would otherwise go without."
"Or the Christmas Store run by Catholic Charities in Terre Haute, where 70 volunteers work year round to brighten the holidays of needy families."
This wonderful Hoosier spirit is our most precious resource.
"As Governor, I will do everything I can to spread it like wildfire."
"I am organizing a Governor's community service round table with leaders from government, business and the non-profit sector."
"It will focus on cost-effective ways to tackle unmet community needs, volunteer recruitment and retention, and greater integration of volunteerism into public and private sector activities."
We have a full agenda before us.
"Sweeping school improvement, returning control to the local level, raising standards and demanding accountability for results."
"A tax cut for Hoosier families, a first step toward a tax system that's fairer and promotes economic growth."
Crossroads 2000's highway construction and improvement.
Completing the transformation of welfare from a handout to a hand up.
Five hundred more police in our communities.More prison space.
And a renewed commitment to community service and common sense Hoosier values.Family.Faith.Community.Hard work.
Opportunity coupled with responsibility.
Public service as a public trust.
Optimism that any obstacle can be overcome if we tackle it together.
Let us never forget that our shared values -- and our love of Indiana -- unite us as Hoosiers.
"And let us always remember that what unites is stronger than our differences, as we work -- together -- to make our State the best place on earth to live, work and raise a family."
