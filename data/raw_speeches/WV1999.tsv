Members of the State Senate, members of the House of Delegates, members of the Board of Public Works, members of the State Supreme Court of Appeals and our guests at tonight’s joint session: To the people of West Virginia, we send New Year’s greetings, and we are proud to be your servants and partners as we begin the final session of the 20th century.
The human race has had some of its finest moments and some of its worst moments during the 20th century.
Our economic base moved from agriculture to industry to information.
Dread diseases that threatened to decimate the human species have disappeared in the path of the immunization needle and miracle cures of modern drugs.
We have found new ways to grow crops to feed the world and new materials to clothe and house the people.
We broke the grip of gravity to explore the universe, discover trillions of galaxies and make contact with the beginnings of time, space and matter.
We opened unexplored worlds in the micro of the atom and the cell.
The United States has absorbed more people from more parts of the world than any other nation in history.
We have redefined gender roles more than they have been reshaped in any comparable period during the past 20 centuries.
Our 20th century experiences leave no doubt that change is inevitable.
As West Virginians, however, we know that change is not guaranteed to benefit our people or our economy.
Too often, we have been the victim of change.
As we approach the new century, we can be the managers of change.
Forty years ago, I dealt with the impacts of change in another State-of-the-State presentation.
When the mining industry had taken its giant stride to full mechanization to remain competitive in a declining market, nearly 25 percent of the state’s work force was displaced.
The economic upheaval in the coalfields sent shock waves across the entire state.
As governor then, I struggled to respond — to find ways to stabilize and diversify the economy.
In fact, I have spent all of the years since working in the private sector to find new, innovative ways to deal with the challenge of change.
That struggle was destined to continue for three decades.
Governors and legislators would come and go, but too many West Virginians remained isolated, unemployed and economically disadvantaged.
During this decade, the leaders and people of West Virginia have responded to the appeals for hope from earlier generations.
We have now built a state ready to embrace the challenges of a new century and, indeed, a new millennium.
Investments in people and in public policies to support state and community growth encourage more businesses to invest in West Virginia and employ a highly motivated work force – our most marketable asset.
Tonight, you and I can exclaim with confidence and optimism that we live in a new West Virginia.
The branches of government have established a new track record of cooperation and unprecedented success.
We have placed loyalty to the state and a genuine interest in the common good ahead of political expediency or personal self-interest.
Numbers confirm our success.
In 1997, we announced the creation of 9,613 new jobs supported by investments in excess of $1 billion.
Dun and Bradstreet identified West Virginia as number one among all the states in the number of new jobs in relation to our size.
In 1998, that momentum grew to a new record of 10,690 new jobs and investments of $1.2 billion.
More than 20,000 new jobs and a $2.3 billion investment in two years are major accomplishments and just cause for our pride.
The 1998 unemployment rate of 6.6 percent is the lowest since 1978.
Now our people can build families, communities and bright futures.
Momentum and optimism are the byproducts of our economic success.
We are challenged to build on that success, and we are ready for new horizons.
But continued success is neither automatic nor guaranteed.
Forces beyond our state borders threaten our growth and our future.
Federal bureaucrats use oppressive, unreasonable regulations and international treaties to impose air quality standards that jeopardize thousands of West Virginia jobs.
The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced stringent ozone emission standards for midwest and southern states that would do little to improve targeted air quality in the northeast but would destroy the competitive position of companies operating in our region.
Companies at risk include some of West Virginia’s finest employers: mining, transportation, utilities and manufacturing companies that pay attractive salaries and benefits to support working families.
Moreover, West Virginia households would see electric bills skyrocket as utilities face the expense of complying with federal regulations that benefit no one.
I have led a coalition of governors from southern and midwestern states to propose alternative emissions reduction to improve the environment and protect our respective economies.
The Kyoto Protocol is yet another threat to our future.
This ill-conceived international treaty asks developed nations to impose strict emission standards to reduce the threat of global warming.
Remarkably, this same treaty exempts developing nations from these air emission standards.
This world map clearly shows the lack of fairness.
Our companies would struggle to comply with standards that overseas competitors would not have to meet.
Last year, this Legislature and the U. S. Senate adopted resolutions to oppose the Kyoto Protocol.
International United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts and his union have been articulate in opposition to this unfair approach.
Last May, I warned Congress that Kyoto implementation would cost West Virginia as many as 26,000 jobs by 2010 and foist higher energy costs upon all our people.
At this very moment, our steel industry faces an enormous external threat.
Domestic steel companies have made remarkable progress during the past decade to modernize and improve production efficiencies and product quality.
Yet foreign nations are subsidizing steel production and dumping their steel in the United States at artificially low prices to raise cash.
Weirton Steel Corporation, West Virginia’s largest single industrial employer, has laid off 900 workers – 20 percent of its work force.
Also, it has shut down a blast furnace to cut production capacity by 30 percent.
Tonight, I call upon the people of West Virginia to join me in petitioning the president of the United States to enforce existing statutes and treaties to protect our steel industry and steelworkers’ jobs and to guarantee fair world trade.
Outside this chamber are tables where West Virginia steelworkers have petitions that members of the Legislature and the people here can sign.
We can join the thousands of people from the mills, factories and communities of our communities of our state to send a message to Washington that is straightforward and simple: The people of West Virginia are ready to compete in the world steel market, but we expect our federal government to maintain a level playing field.

html) Earlier, I discussed two national air quality initiatives that threaten our economic way of life.
I certainly do not propose to ignore environmental quality.
I do insist that we look beyond present-day rhetoric and narrow thinking to cast a new 21st century model.
Our state is critical in the nation’s energy chain, but West Virginia alone cannot forge a national energy policy that our country currently lacks.
We must insist on having a role in the formulation of such a policy so we can build an economy that will weather the 21st century.
Last year, I testified before an appropriations committee and called on Congress to commit more resources to energy research and development.
Such a commitment can provide direction for the environmentally sound extraction and use of coal to generate electricity to power factories and provide jobs.
As a nation, we must emphasize the proper use of coal – our most abundant resource – to meet our energy needs.
Clean-burning natural gas and crude oil add important components to West Virginia’s role in a realistic national energy policy.
All governors recognize the federal government’s responsibility to set environmental standards for the entire nation.
We also believe these standards should be developed in consultation with the states and based on sound science and regional strategies.
Groups representing extreme positions have largely shaped environmental management and debate.
Government needs to establish a balance between costs and benefits in the exercise of its environmental stewardship.
I believe the environment and natural resources can be protected and, at the same time, provide recreation and employment for people.
I seek collaboration, not polarization.
We reward results, not specific programs.
This new approach is working in our state.
Westvaco Corporation has contracted with the Nature Conservancy to conduct an environmental audit of each of its 350,000 acres of West Virginia forestland.
It will identify environmentally sensitive sites, including habitats for endangered species, unique plants and geological formations.
This model of cooperation leads to decisions built on common ground and avoids divisive, nonproductive confrontations.
In another arena where change is inevitable, the courts have ruled that West Virginia fails to provide a thorough and efficient school system as required by the Constitution.
In response to this judicial mandate and in an effort to manage this change, I appointed the Governor’s Commission on Fair Taxation to examine the entire state tax system, including the funding of public education.
We are not in a financial crisis, and I feel this is the time to look at the whole system.
The underlying issue is simple: Is our system fair?
Is it fair to ask our families to pay a tax each year on their cars and trucks – the vehicles they must drive to work, school and church?
Is it fair to demand that our lower income families pay an income tax?
Is it fair that our businesses are burdened with a complex jungle of taxes and forms?
I believe we can agree on the answers to these questions.
You have received the commission’s findings and recommendations.
Reforming the state tax system will require caution and thoughtful deliberation.
I propose the creation of a select joint legislative committee on tax reform to consider the commission’s recommendations and work with me to develop a timetable for holding a special session and placing a constitutional amendment before the people.
Reducing the number of taxes, closing loopholes and eliminating exemptions will create one class of tax citizenship that asks each of us to pay our fair share but asks none of us to pay someone else’s share.
I believe these reforms will attract more economic investments and create more good paying jobs.
I believe we can have a tax system that is simple, fair and less expensive to administer.
I urge the Legislature and the people of West Virginia to join me in this important initiative.
We also work to manage change by embracing the potential of technology.
The ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network, a cornerstone of the West Virginia 2001 public-private initiative by the state and Bell Atlantic, has made it possible to develop the West Virginia Statewide Unified Network.
It will offer users full Internet access, e-mail, e-commerce, video conferencing and other data communications capabilities.
Through it, the Courtroom of the Future has been a pilot program involving my administration, the West Virginia State Supreme Court, Cabell and Kanawha counties and Bell Atlantic.
This initiative connects courtrooms with jails to transfer video and data to facilitate judicial proceedings and offer telemedicine for inmates and training for correctional officers and inmates.
The proposed budget includes funds to purchase equipment, telephone service and connection devices for all 55 counties to become a part of the Statewide Unified Network, to advance the consolidation of all state agency data communications systems and to participate in this innovative new project.
The PROMISE program of the Science and Technology Advisory Council should be expanded to connect small businesses and higher education, research important new technologies and lay the groundwork for new business opportunities.
West Virginia should establish a national center of excellence for the development of identification technologies.
This center will focus research on biometric and identification technologies and act as a clearinghouse for identification science and technology information.
In cooperation with secondary and higher education systems, we shall establish Cisco Networking Academies across the state.
These academics are a partnership between Cisco Systems and schools to train and certify students as network professionals for the new industrial job markets.
Because of your wise legislative decisions during this decade, economic growth and expansion momentum is on our side.
We are challenged to keep the momentum going.
We are managing to change the lives of West Virginians by creating new jobs for our citizens, investing in the building blocks of economic growth, creating an environment conducive to job creation and promoting West Virginia at every opportunity.
With the cooperation of the President and Speaker, I have invited the chief executive officers of several companies who chose to locate or expand in West Virginia in the recent past to come to Charleston for an informal joint session next week.
They will share with us what attracted them to our state and suggest actions we need to take to make us more attractive.
The high cost of Workers’ Compensation is the number one problem for doing business in West Virginia.
Over many years, inadequate rates based on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis, lack of internal controls and abuse of the second injury fund contributed to a monumental deficit.
Efforts initiated in the past few years have turned around a fund that was destined for certain failure.
While we are moving the fund in the right direction, future actions can pull it from a deficit to a solvent financial position.
My administration has been working with the legislative leadership to find ways to minimize the insurance risk and identify alternative markets for the management and payout of long-term claims.
Our proposals are designed to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible while protecting the benefits of injured workers.
As we continue to work on our infrastructure, the Council for Community and Economic Development has approved $8 million of bond proceeds for eight industrial development projects.
This investment leveraged an additional $18.4 million to build industrial parks, shell buildings and other economic development projects to create 1,500 jobs immediately.
In total, infrastructure funds of $219 million have been committed to 83 water and wastewater projects leveraged by $246 million of other funds for a total of $465 million in projects.
More than 500,000 persons will have benefited from new or improved water or wastewater service as a result.
I am proud of our efforts to support water projects with one of the state’s largest water utilities in Boone, Fayette, Mercer, Summers and Lewis counties by using public/private partnerships.
Nearly 50 percent of this $123 million investment has come from private industry.
We continue to search for private and public funds to progress with infrastructure projects in the state, a vital component for economic development.
The West Virginia Public Port Authority has completed or is near completion of feasibility studies for river ports in Wood, Hancock, Monongalia, Jackson and Fayette counties and the Kanawha-Putnam and Cabell-Wayne areas.
This approach takes advantage of our tremendous water resources.
I am exploring with Pennsylvania and Maryland the creation of a Monongahela River Valley interstate compact to deal with development in that 18-county watershed.
Small business also is essential to the state’s economy as 89 percent of our businesses hire 20 or fewer employees and account for a third of the work force.
Tonight I am proud to announce that our Small Business Work Force Program has won a national award as a state model of excellence from the U. S. Small Business Administration.
Our Small Business Development Center has awarded 330 grants to train more than 3,100 small business owners and their employees in the past two years.
The Governor’s Guaranteed Work Force Program provides business and industrial job training assistance to new and existing companies to provide a qualified work force.
The program in 1998 served 125 companies and trained nearly 26,000 employees with awards of $2.4 million.
We have sold $220 million in road bonds authorized last year by the Legislature at an interest rate of less than 5 percent.
The Division of Highways will use these funds immediately to fund projects already advertised for bids.
I propose the sale of an additional $110 million to keep pace with our record-breaking road program in every county.
In the past year, the Division of Highways has announced the widening of some of our critical Interstate highways, including I-64, I-79 and I-81.
It has renovated or replaced 84 bridges and resurfaced 1,600 miles of highways to give our citizens better and safer access to church, school and work.
In just six months under the Home Access Roads Program, the division has brought 546 orphan roads into the state system.
Working together to fulfill the promise of the Safe Roads Amendment of 1996, we can keep our aggressive highways program moving forward.
The state has entered into an agreement with the National Park Service to initiate the 11-county National Coal Heritage Project in southern West Virginia.
We have worked with legislators and community leaders to establish the extensive Hatfield-McCoy Trail System in seven counties also in southern West Virginia.
"""Mountain Stage"" is a huge billboard for West Virginia that helps to attract business and tourism."
Currently the radio program reaches more than 110 stations that serve major markets across the nation.
"I propose a general revenue line-item appropriation for ""Mountain Stage"" in the amount of $200,000."
We are managing to change the lives of West Virginians by improving education and preparing our students for the employment and education opportunities of the future.
The SUCCESS initiative has installed 7,841 computer workstations in 280 secondary schools.
In the past two years, more than 2,300 teachers have received staff development training.
In 1989, the Legislature began funding for the basic skills/computer education program for kindergarten and elementary classrooms.
Today, 24,182 student workstations are in use, and 19,805 teachers have participated in basic skills training programs.
The budget before you provides $16 million for the continuation of these initiatives.
The Internet is linked to every school in the state except for 12 schools served by small phone companies.
We are working to improve the state’s college-going rate, which lags behind the national average.
The Higher Education Grant Program has had increased funding by $2.6 million during the past two years.
I propose to use $6 million this year to fund the first year of a two-year program to support 100 percent of those students who qualify with 70 percent of their college tuition costs.
Along with the pre-paid tuition plan, this effort should encourage more of our young people to be ready for the 21st century job market.
Since last January, Jobs for West Virginia’s Graduates has served 1,019 high school seniors in 30 schools.
Many of these students have behavioral problems and are at risk of dropping out of school.
Job specialists work with these students to help them graduate and remain with them for a period after graduation.
Nationally, this program has a graduation rate in excess of 90 percent.
If our success rate is comparable this year, we will seek permanent state funding next year.
We must maintain a proper environment in public schools for learning to occur.
The state with the lowest crime rate in the nation should have the safest schools in the nation.
I believe we can accomplish this goal in a simple, common-sense manner without expanding government.
At my direction, the State Police has launched Operation Safe Schools to detect and deal with firearms in the schools.
Troopers work in the schools to instruct personnel on how to handle security issues.
They are in the process of instructing 5,600 school personnel in 214 schools.
In addition, we are expanding the State Police K-9 Unit to work with principals to sweep schools for drugs.
If we eliminate drugs from the schools, we can eliminate guns from schools.
While removing barriers to education, we also must be certain our institutions are flexible enough to respond to the demands of the workplaces of the new West Virginia.
The James Rumsey Technical Institute and Shepherd College recognize the dramatic growth of the printing industry in the Eastern Panhandle and along I-81.
Knowing that public education can be more responsive to the employer community, James Rumsey and Shepherd have conducted two pilot projects to make certain that employee-students are competent in specific vocational areas.
This program will serve as a model for use in other areas of the state.
We also must take advantage of the enormous training opportunities that the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing affords employers.
The institute’s relationship with our state-supported community colleges and employers provides another valuable tool to prepare West Virginia residents for manufacturing jobs in the 21st century.
In another effort to improve accessibility of education, West Virginia is a leading participant in the Southern Regional Electronic Campus, which enables students across West Virginia and the south to take courses at scores of colleges and universities without leaving home.
Students – both traditional and non-traditional – can enter the electronic campus by computer and link with the college or university offering courses.
Six West Virginia institutions already participate in this year-old program.
With more than 1,250 courses offered beginning this semester, the Southern Regional Electronic Campus gives the people one more avenue to education and success.
In another educational initiative that involves technology, the Bureau of Senior Services and Microsoft will establish the Seniors Technology Training Program.
"The program recognizes the aging of our population and gives West Virginia’s senior citizens an opportunity to become familiar with information technology and close what is known as the ""digital divide,"" the gap between computer users and non-users."
At our senior centers, we can prepare senior citizens to enhance their own lives and the lives of others around them by using and teaching technology.
With the support of our partners, my goal is to provide our senior citizens unprecedented access to the information superhighway and give some of our most talented and creative citizens a valuable tool to help others.
By investing in our children and families, we manage change for the future.
I believe the time has come for West Virginia to protect children and families from the moral corruption and crime associated with unregulated pornography.
Therefore I shall propose a Child Protection and Family Decency Act to keep pornography away from children and give law enforcement the tools it needs to halt the growth of crime associated with this business.
The Governor’s Cabinet on Children and Families has built a record of innovation and success in its 10 years of operation.
Family Resource Networks play important roles in every county.
With your support, Starting Points Early Childhood Centers operate in 20 counties and parent education programs in nine counties.
This cabinet should not have to depend on other agencies for support; it should be a stand-alone program.
Welfare rolls have decreased dramatically — 71 percent since January 1997.
Monthly federal/state cash assistance is down from $8.19 million to $3.33 million in the same period.
The Microenterprise Demonstration Program helps West Virginia Works clients transition from public assistance to self-employment.
Small Business Development Centers provide training and business plan development while microloan funds offer financing up to $10,000.
Eighty clients in 29 rural counties will participate during the next two years.
Access to affordable quality child care is central to welfare reform and support of low-income working families.
We have increased child care positions and increased rates for providers who earn professional accreditation and who care for children during non-traditional hours.
During the past two years, the Department of Health and Human Resources has harnessed the runaway costs of caring for children placed out of state by West Virginia courts.
The number is down from 478 to 242 in two years – a 49 percent decrease.
A comprehensive in-state system is cost effective and serves the best interests of children and families.
Last year, I set a goal to recruit and certify 300 new foster families in 1998.
More than 400 new foster families have been recruited and certified.
Since early 1997, DHHR has aggressively sought Title IV-E federal funding to support foster children in state custody, a funding stream not maximized in the past.
Using a two-year reach-back provision, the agency has claimed nearly $10 million in new federal funds.
If mechanical failure or a flat tire strands you on West Virginia interstates or Appalachian corridors, help is available.
The 24-hour Courtesy Patrol has been re-instituted, staffed by 133 West Virginia Works participants in 25 counties.
The patrol already has traveled more than one million miles and assisted 2,620 stranded drivers.
With legislative support last year, we have provided local health departments the resources to concentrate on basic public health services, strengthen their fiscal base and establish clear direction through performance-based standards.
Last year, West Virginia won the Centers for Disease Control award for the greatest improvement in the immunization of 2-year-old children.
While I have opposed any general tax increase, I believe West Virginia should tax smokeless tobacco.
Excessive use of these products leads to high incidences of tobacco-related diseases, especially among young people.
I propose a 25 percent excise tax on the wholesale price of tobacco products that now are not subject to state excise tax with the revenues directed to public health programs because this is a public health issue.
Of the projected $7 million in income, $5 million should be used to underwrite children’s health insurance; $1 million to offset medical school underfunding a year ago; and $1 million for a revolving loan fund to buy equipment for rural health centers.
While I have taken some heat for not reducing government, I take pride that we have made government better, not bigger.
The Department of Administration has refunded bond issues to save $3.3 million in interest charges.
With appreciation to State Auditor Gainer and Treasurer Perdue, the purchasing card program has been an unqualified success for state government.
The program averages 18,000 transactions totaling $2.5 million per month.
Based on industry standards, the program has saved taxpayers $8.4 million, and these savings could reach $25 million next year.
During the 1990s, the number of inmates in state prisons and jails practically doubled with a corresponding increase in housing costs to meet federal standards.
The Regional Jail Authority has used creative money management to refund its $118 million bonds of 1990, reducing the interest rate from 6.97 percent to 4.91 percent, which represents one of the highest percentages of any refunded package in the entire nation.
That represents a savings of millions of dollars.
After 20 years of planning, the Regional Jail System – the first of its kind in the nation – is completely funded and will house the inmates of every county jail by 2001.
In fact, most of the growth in state government employment can be attributed directly to the expansion of our regional jail system, the increase in our inmate population and the addition of 500 new employees in the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety.
Of the increase, the State Police has enlisted 130 new cadet troopers during the past two years, filling vacancies created by retirements and other attrition while adding 59 new troopers as part of the plan to provide better law enforcement across the state.
Almost all other departments have maintained or reduced their staffing levels.
The proposed budget also includes funding for the Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA) to help mitigate program cuts without increasing premiums.
In the Division of Highways, our managers have implemented better management practices to control the use of overtime.
We reduced overtime pay in DOH nearly $7 million in each of the past two years from 1996 levels.
As state government employees struggle each day to meet the needs of our citizens, they are mindful of the enormous investment that our taxpayers have made.
Through the use of new technologies and better management practices, state government is more efficient.
Our experience during the past two years suggests that state government can become smaller even when faced with increased demands.
Another means is through aggressive privatization initiatives.
I pledge to use private business to do what private business can do better than government.
We shall explore the expansion of the privately operated child support collection pilot project, successful in Kanawha County, to the entire state.
We shall take the next logical step and privatize the warehousing and wholesaling of liquor.
And, finally, we shall privatize the distribution of food to schools and food pantries across the state – a function now handled by the Department of Health and Human Resources.
Mindful of these initiatives and other changes, I am submitting to the Legislature a balanced budget of $2.66 billion.
It fully funds all critical programs – including the second year of our plan to raise the pay of state employees and teachers by more than $2,200 over three years.
In addition, we shall fully fund critical pension systems, including the teachers’ retirement system.
As we plunge into this legislative session, we recognize that we deal with a range of important issues.
Our list of tasks is laden with significant and complex issues: n comprehensive tax reform; n the creation of jobs for the people of West Virginia; n the preservation of those opportunities by insisting that policymakers in Washington understand our position; n a commitment to ensure safe schools; n access to diverse training and educational opportunities to prepare our people for the 21st century; and n an ongoing commitment to make government better, not bigger.
Through cooperation, collaboration and mutual respect, we can solidify the many assets that we have developed in the recent past and build upon those assets.
The choice is ours.
The future is ours and our children’s.
During this last year of the 20th century, let us work to pave a clear path to success in the century just ahead.
Together we can manage change to continue improving the lives of West Virginians.
With the blessing of God and the commitment of the people of West Virginia, we shall build a future that is limited only by the bounds of our vision.
