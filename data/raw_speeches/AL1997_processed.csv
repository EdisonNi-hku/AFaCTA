SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Governor Siegelman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, the Senate and the High Courts, my fellow Alabamians, on behalf of the executive branch of state government, it is my privilege and duty to report to you on the State of the State."
I cannot help but note the absence of some familiar faces and the presence of new ones.
"The Legislature and the state suffered a heavy loss on September 13, 1996, when Senator Michael Figures of Mobile unexpectedly departed this life."
"I welcome Senator Vivian Davis Figures, Michael's courageous widow."
We lost a dedicated public servant and dear friend when Representative Sam Letson of Moulton died just after last year's session began.
"I look forward to serving with Sam's brother, Rep. Jody Letson, as we continue Sam's good work."
You may be proud of concrete achievements the past two years.
You sent to the people three constitutional amendments to curb judicial activism and the people of this state ratified every single one of them.
You enacted a competitive incentive plan to attract industry and it did.
And I am pleased to report Alabama's unemployment rate is the lowest ever -- four percent.
Alabama state government is more efficient.
"As a result there is absolutely no need for new or increased state taxes, as this year's General Fund has a projected surplus of some 40-million dollars."
"This surplus is the product of hard work by cabinet members and state employees who reduced the cost of many agencies, starting with the Governor's Office and the Finance Department."
"As a result of natural attrition and a hiring freeze, we have 3,138 fewer employees and a savings to the taxpayers of over 60-million dollars."
"And, with continued good stewardship, the day may be near when state taxes can be cut."
"Competitive bidding and out-sourcing are good tools, and I will continue to use them to the fullest extent."
You passed a law that protects the citizen from vote fraud by absentee ballot.
Now I urge you to pass our Voter Identification Bill that will protect the citizen from other forms of voter fraud such as someone voting more than once or voting on behalf of a deceased person.
"Always remember, honest government starts with honest elections."
"In accord with our 1995 Education Reform Act, strong action has been taken where needed to remove mismanagement and academic failure from public schools."
"And with the enactment of this year's budget, we will have increased funding for K-12 by almost one-half billion dollars without raising taxes one red cent."
"I thank our State Superintendent of Education, Dr. Ed Richardson, and Deputy Superintendents, Drs."
"Jimmy Baker and Joe Morton, along with local school officials and teachers for their good work."
"We must never forget it is the classroom teacher who carries the burden of instruction and discipline, the essence of learning."
I salute them all with appreciation and respect.
"And speaking of good work, let me recognize the Winfield City School System, its Superintendent, Dr. Dale Brasher, and principals, teachers, students, and parents."
"When tested by national standards, Winfield ranked fifth out of 127 Alabama school systems."
"Yet, Winfield ranks 121st of 127 in funding!"
"Dr. Brasher, you set an example from which we can all learn."
Dr. Brasher is with us tonight and he is due not only our gratitude but also a strong round of applause.
"HIGHER EDUCATION I would like to speak candidly with you about waste, duplication and governance in post-secondary education."
Comparisons to neighboring states make my point without room for serious contradiction.
"As a benchmark, Alabama will spend 962-million dollars this year and has a population of 4.2 million people."
"Simply to match what we now spend, the Georgia Legislature would have to increase its per capita appropriation for higher education by 25 percent; Florida, by 60 percent; and Tennessee, by 27 percent.Let's look a little closer."
"Tennessee spends 934-million dollars and has one-million or 24 percent more people, yet Alabama spends not less, as you might expect."
We spend three percent or 28-million more dollars than Tennessee.
"Louisiana spends 646-million dollars and has about the same population as we have, and so you would think we would spend about the same.Wrong!"
Alabama spends 317-million more dollars.
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is a whopping 33 percent more than a state with the same population!"
"The comparisons could go on, and we don't have to stay in the deep South to prove the point."
The great farming and industrial state of Wisconsin spends just under one-billion dollars yet has almost one-million or 20 percent more people than Alabama.
Does Wisconsin spend 20 percent more than we do?
"No, Wisconsin spends practically the same amount."
We now have 15 four-year institutions in Alabama.
"Simply to reach the point of saturation, Florida would have to open 41 brand new four-year schools in the morning; Georgia, 11; South Carolina, six; and Tennessee, nine."
It sounds like an SEC football scoreboard.
The comparisons to other states for two-year schools are comparable.
Can we conclude by all of this that the Alabama taxpayer wants to send a lot more money to Montgomery?
"I think not, as I have yet to meet the first taxpayer with a voluntary check to the Revenue Department."
"Do not misunderstand me, I have the deepest appreciation for higher education and for the role of our junior colleges and technical schools."
Please do not read my insistence on pruning as hostility.
"To the contrary, as any good gardener knows, pruning what needs to be pruned will make a much better garden."
"Hence, pruning will enhance the quality of post-secondary education in its entirety, as we build on our strengths and eliminate our weaknesses."
"Now, you the legislators hold the purse strings lock, stock, and barrel."
"So if there is going to be pruning, you have got to do it or designate someone to do it.I volunteer."
"I have two options that I offer for your consideration to achieve a 10 percent pruning and, I might add, I have never seen anything of substantial magnitude that could not be pruned by a mere 10 percent and improved at the same time."
"Option One -- Fold all four-year colleges into two systems -- Alabama and Auburn; with the president of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa campus, being in charge of the Alabama system, and the president of Auburn University being in charge of the Auburn system."
"Option Two -- Create a nine-member board of regents comprised of one member from each Congressional district appointed by the Governor, confirmed by the Senate to six-year staggered terms, and the Finance Director and the Governor as chairman."
"ACHE would be made part of the board of regents, and the director of ACHE would serve at the pleasure of the board."
ACHE would administer the business of the board of regents at no extra cost.
I would leave governance of two-year schools under the State Board of Education because grades 13 and 14 whether liberal arts or technical are a continuation of K-12.
The same principle of pruning by 10 percent would apply here with equal force.
I would streamline the Chancellor's office to one of quality and cost control.
Implementing these proposals should reduce the cost of two and four-year schools by at least 10 percent.
"From these savings, we will have a merit scholarship trust fund of 100-million dollars per year to enable 75-thousand Alabama students to attend the college of their choice."
The competition created by these scholarships would be an added incentive to excel for school and scholar alike.
"WELFARE REFORM For once, Washington has built a road that carries power and control out of, rather than into, the federal government."
I speak of the newly enacted welfare reform and the obligations of all states to implement it.
"I have a copy of it here and, as you can see, its 820 pages long."
"About 800 pages too long, which is typical of big government."
"We saw these changes coming and in December of 1995, I appointed a 38-member Commission on Welfare Reform."
"I would like to thank all the members for their hard work and recognize the legislative members of that commission -- Reps. Cams, Baker, Maull, Hooper, and Jackson and Senators Adams, Sanders and Clay."
"I would be remiss if I did not take special note of the tireless efforts of Rep. Jim Cams, the able chair of this commission who brings credit to the calling of public service."
Let me quote an American president who wisely foresaw the problems of today.
"He said: ""The lessons of history show conclusively that continued dependence on relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber."
"To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit."
So spoke Franklin Delano Roosevelt over 60 years ago.
"And so, over 60 years later, ending subsidized irresponsibility will be the guiding principle of welfare reform in Alabama."
"I wish to express my deepest appreciation to Mrs. Martha Nachman, our welfare commissioner, for her vigorous and candid effort to shed the light of truth on this issue."
"Martha, you are on the right track -- never look back as we stand behind you 100 percent."
I remain committed without apology to the two propositions that a mother needs a husband and a child needs both a father and a name.
Welfare reform must include provisions to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies and to encourage marriage.
"As called for by a federal law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, I will ask for laws that will locate absentee parents, or, since most of the offenders are men, ""deadbeat dads."
Alabama has 70-thousand parents owing about one-billion dollars who are more than six months behind in child support.
And we are spending over 50-million dollars per year just to collect this money.
"Therefore, we must require businesses to disclose new hires to the Department of Industrial Relations."
"Men who father children may try to run from their responsibilities but, with such controls in place, they won't be able to hide."
"Through this system we can also catch fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits, and reduce this form of welfare fraud."
We must be methodical as we do not want innocent children to go hungry nor should we refuse aid to someone who truly needs help.
"Welfare reform should provide assistance in locating jobs, recognizing that employment may be easier to come by in some counties than in others."
"If it is hard-hearted to be unsympathetic to the slothful, and the cheat, then I plead guilty."
"And, if it is soft-hearted to be supportive of the innocent and truly disadvantaged citizens of this state, then I plead guilty again."
"When all is said and done, the noble cause of compassion for the less fortunate should no longer be invoked in justification of a welfare system that rewards dependency and irresponsibility."
TORT REFORM Another road we must travel together is the road to tort reform.
I view tort reform as a part of civil law that runs parallel to the criminal law because the reason for an award of punitive damage is to punish and deter the wrongdoer.
"However, tort law that creates inconsistent penalties, frivolous lawsuits, and inflated insurance premiums is wrong -- dead wrong."
"On the other hand, a code of civil and criminal law that does not fully protect the injured party is equally wrong -- equally dead wrong."
In the past we have been unable to address this issue except by constitutional amendment because the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that limits on punitive damages established by the 1987 Legislature violated the Alabama Constitution.
This intrusion into the authority of the Legislature by our Supreme Court left us without any real standards.
"Then, last summer, the United States Supreme Court held in Gore vs. BMW that our standardless system violated the United States Constitution, a failure that came as a direct result of the Alabama Supreme Court's 1993 intrusion into the power of the Legislature."
The issue has thus come back to you -- where it belonged in the first place.
"In our civil code, I propose to cap punitive damages at 750-thousand dollars except for wrongful death actions."
This change will impose a cap in a dollar amount identical to that recently enacted in Texas.
Our criminal code at present time does not include criminal fraud which is a disgrace.
"I propose the toughest criminal fraud bill our able Attorney General, Bill Pryor, can design."
"A criminal fraud bill that punishes the wrongdoer with a Class C Felony, which carries a jail sentence of one-to-ten years and/or a fine of up to five-thousand dollars or up to twice the ill-gotten gain."
That means a corporation guilty of criminal fraud that made 2-million dollars could be hit with a 4-million dollar fine payable to the state of Alabama.Yours is not an easy task.
We have 50 states and there are 50 flavors of tort law.
"But, remember, justice is what we seek."
I believe this proposal moves us closer to justice for every Alabamian.
"HIGHWAYS I propose a 700-million dollar highway bond issue: (1) To speed up four-laning of major state highway projects, such as Highway 331 from State Route 94 to LeGrand, Highway 280 from the Tallapoosa River to Opelika, U. S. 80 from east of the river in Marengo County to west of the river in Sumter County and the Uniontown Bypass in Marengo and Perry Counties, and a segment of U. S. 82 from Reform to the Tuscaloosa County line."
"(2) To continue with the work on the Patton Island Bridge in Florence, the Birmingham Northern Beltline, the Huntsville Southern Bypass, the 3rd River Bridge in Tuscaloosa, and the Montgomery Outer Loop."
"(3) To accelerate construction of roads and bridges that you know deserve top priority, yet without this bond issue will be delayed another five or more years."
"Such projects include: U. S. 431 from the Barbour County line to north of Pittsview Anniston East Bypass State Route 77 in Etowah County from Green Valley to Sunset Drive, and also U. S. 411 from Gadsden to Turkeytown (4) Bond proceeds will also allow us to initiate engineering studies on: U. S. 43 from Tuscaloosa to Corridor X U. S. 98 in Mobile from the Mississippi line to Snow Road A freeway connector from Dothan to I-10 (5) And to provide a minimum of one-million dollars to each of our 67 counties with a total commitment of 83-million dollars to build and repair Alabama's rural roads and bridges."
We will pay for this bond issue with the present debt service stream as existing debt is retired and from savings generated from efficiencies in the operations of the Highway Department.
We will not touch one cent of current funding for construction.
"The people of Alabama need these roads and bridges for stronger economic growth, for greater job opportunity, for increasing tourism and for their safety and convenience."
"I submit to you this bond issue is just plain, good business."
"INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM I support, as always, a strong initiative and referendum amendment, and I hope you will give this great principle the serious attention that it deserves."
"It would be enlightening, indeed, for the people to vote on the initiatives just raised."
PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION There are moral issues from which we cannot escape.
"Therefore, I will propose legislation prohibiting partial birth abortions unless the mother's life is endangered."
"I will propose legislation requiring that 48 hours prior to an abortion the mother be notified who ill perform the procedure, what the procedure will entail, the risks associated with the procedure, and most importantly, the alternatives to this procedure."
"Should the individual be a minor, our legislation will require that the parent or guardian sign a consent form in front of the provider."
"CHILDREN I recently received a letter from Miss Jenny Lynn Watson, age 10, from Enterprise, Alabama."
"In it she wrote, ""Please set aside a day honoring children in my community and other children in Alabama."
"Yes, Jenny, with the concurrence of Speaker Clark, Governor Siegelman, and the Alabama Legislature we shall dedicate this session to all of Alabama's children."
We long for the day when responsible parenthood in our society will reach such high level that government is neither needed nor much wanted in family life.
"We must keep in mind that most parents care deeply for their children, act in accordance with a parent's natural love for their child, raise their children as best they can, and believe that the government has neither legal nor moral authority to interfere in the home."
"We must also be certain that when a child is in danger from abuse or neglect or in harm's way, the immediate protection of that child supersedes all other considerations."
Let us do our best to strike the proper balance in the laws we pass and the appropriations we make for the care of children.
We are currently spending through 13 state agencies and 57 programs 1.54-billion dollars in state and federal funds for children.
"In addition, we are spending another 17-million dollars through 15 other agencies.All told, 1."
56-billion dollars excluding city and county funding.What does all of this mean?
Are our multi-billion dollar efforts getting the desired results?
"I'm not sure, but my budget proposal will include all of the above-mentioned state appropriations and, in addition, a three-million dollar increase for community detention subsidies and 30-million new dollars from the General Fund for children's welfare and protection."
"I don't have all the answers on this issue, but I will gladly walk the last mile to help any child, and I request we walk this mile together and put our total attention to finding the true cause and the real cure for child neglect and abuse in our society."
"QUINTS Let me close this discussion of children with a phenomenon that gives dramatic meaning to the time-worn phrase, ""blessed event"" or, should I say, ""blessed events."
"Never in the history of our republic have five healthy male quintuplets been born, until a four-minute span on August 8, 1996, right here in Montgomery."
Tonight I have the privilege of introducing to you the only set of healthy male quints ever born in this country.
"In a setting where survival is often a struggle these little boys have shown strength, heart and perseverance."
On Saturday they mark six months of life in good health.
"Let's welcome Amy and Eric Guttensohn and little Hunter, Mason, Parker, Tanner, and Taylor."
I have issued an official proclamation declaring this to be Guttensohn Day in Alabama.
"Amy and Eric, you have a bountiful blessing from God, and I pledge to do all I can to make this state a place where these boys and the rest of the children of this state can reach their highest potential."
I thank all of the Guttensohns for being here tonight.
"BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT AND CONCLUSION And finally, as we approach the 21st Century, the absence of a balanced budget amendment to the U. S. Constitution is the dominant threat to the liberty of the American people."
"I think Congress will not fail its duty to pass the amendment, but then it must be ratified by three-fourths of the state Legislatures."
It is my hope and prayer you will be the first Legislature in the nation to ratify a balanced budget amendment.
One generation should not enslave the other with debt.
The unlimited ability to borrow has resulted in a federal debt totaling 5.3 trillion dollars.
That means that a child born today owes nearly 200-thousand dollars in taxes just to pay the interest on the debt.
That means the Guttensohn boys were born owing the U. S. government one-million dollars.Such injustice cannot stand.
"Thomas Jefferson said, and I quote, "" The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity is but swindling futurity on a large scale."
A balanced budget amendment is a guarantor of individual freedom.
We are Alabamians first and always.
Partisan politics has no role in serving the people.
Rest assured that my administration will work with each of you to advance the well-being of our citizens.All of them.
Thank you for your attention and I extend my best wishes for another good session.
