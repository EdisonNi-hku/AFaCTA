Good evening, President Beattie, Speaker Stephens, Chief Justice Howe, Lieutenant Governor Walker and my fellow Utahns.
For the 103rd time since statehood, a governor rises to deliver a State of the State address to the Legislature and the people.
It is my privilege to stand tonight to mark the opening session of the 53rd Legislature; a nationwide observance of human rights; and the embarkation of a progressive, young state on the journey of millennial succession.
The state of our state in 1999 is a strong economy, abundant jobs, shrinking class sizes and rising overpasses.
The portrait of our people reflects pioneering drive and confident ability.
The final year of the century has arrived in a tempest of doubt and confidence.
The stock market soars amid the trial of impeachment.
One week, Iraq dominates world headlines.
The next week, we do.
For the past month, our state has been the focus of attention we would never have invited.
It has been a period of relentless soul-searching as community standards of integrity collided with the difficult revelations about conduct in bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
Every Utahn feels the sting of a scandal that has diminished a great movement and poisoned, for now, the wellspring of excitement and pride we felt upon becoming an Olympic host.
At one of the darkest moments of this disheartening experience I found myself sitting alone in the library of the governors residence.
The words my father said to me nearly every time I left the house as a boy came to my mind.
"""Remember who you are and what you stand for."
Tonight I stand at the pulpit of the people, in this most formal state setting, to say firmly, unequivocally: We know who we are.
We know what we stand for.
We are a people familiar with success and the honest ethic of work that compels it.
We are a state of industry that cultivated a desert.
This is the place that linked an entire nation by railroad.
We do not excuse our contribution to this problem; we accept responsibility and pledge its correction.
What we hunger for the world to understand and for history to record is that the dishonorable actions of a few do not represent the collective aspirations of the many.
Let the promise of opportunity flow from this moment of adversity.
Ours is to make a contribution of lasting value.
Not just a Games that are higher, faster, stronger, but an entire movement that is truer, nobler and worthier.
In a short time Utah will have fully inventoried and disclosed the mistakes of the bid process, formed new leadership and reunified our people to the task of moving forward.
We will host a games of historic quality and do it within available Olympic revenues.
The International Olympic Committee must now do likewise: Tell all, expel the offenders, change the bid process and return to its place as a force of human ennoblement.
Tonight I call on the entire Olympic family: Let history remember this as the cleansing moment when we look inward and returned the games to its roots of athleticism and altruism rather than money and materialism.
Let the gift for which Utah is most remembered be returning the Olympics to the athletes.
DIGITAL STATE Let the world see the true face of Utah when it arrives in 2002, and let it also see the future.
In 1903, the first telephone lines came to my hometown of Cedar City.
Two years later, an extension was run into a small town to the north called Enoch.
Just outside Enoch lived a gentleman by the name of William H. Grimshaw, and it was William H. Grimshaw's desire to obtain what was then unobtainable a telephone in his own home.
The manager of the Cedar City phone company tried to dissuade him, noting that the cost of extending the wires was impractical and expensive.
But William was not a man to be denied.
He set about connecting every barbed wire connecting his property to town.
Few believed it would do anything but maybe spook the cattle a little.
But then William borrowed a phone, installed it and rang up central.
"Arabella Jones, the operator said, ""Number please."
"Who is this?"""
"The smuggest voice in Iron County replied, ""This is William H. Grimshaw on Linger Longer Lane talking on the barbed wire fence."
It took 75 years for William Grimshaw's dream of a phone in his home to become reality for nearly every Utahn.
And by then, other dreams were materializing.
In the span of 25 years, thanks to Philo Farnsworth, television revolutionized the world.
Tonight, I would like to propose an initiative of shoot-the-moon proportions; one that equals the impact of telephones and television; one that, thanks to the Internet, is becoming reality in the quick blink of a decade.
"By the time the world comes here to visit in 2002, I propose we have in place the foundation for a truly ""digital"" state, including the ability to deliver high-speed, high-capacity ""webtone"" to every home, school, and business in this state."
Webtone is not a familiar term yet, but it will be.
It is quick, immediate, high-speed access to the worldwide web, and soon it will be as commonplace and as easy as picking up a telephone and hearing dial tone.
It works at speeds one hundred times faster than we have today.
"Once this step is in place, it enables all the rest of the goals that are part of becoming a ""digital"" state: the capability to deliver education from colleges and universities directly into homes."
The capability to pay bills, conduct banking, and make purchases online.
The capability to deliver medical services to remote areas electronically.
The capability to access government services 24 hours a day.
Such high-speed access will be a boon to business bottom lines throughout the state.
For this to occur, there must be a new level of cooperation, as well as appropriate competition, among technology providers telephone companies, cable operators, wireless companies, and Internet service providers.
It will not happen unless we work together.
The state's role will be to remove unnecessary barriers to innovation, incent new investment in infrastructure, protect ratepayers, and create a level playing field for competition.
And we must make sure this buildout of digital infrastructure occurs all over the state.
Today the dream of webtone, building a 'digital Main Street', and a college class in every kitchen is achievable.
PUBLIC EDUCATION Let me move on now from the most sweeping of our visions to our most challenging of priorities.
Over the past six years, we have reduced class sizes, raised teacher pay and hooked classrooms to the Internet.
We have rewarded local control and innovation.
Our goal is the continuous improvement of public education, and number one in that continuum is reading.
While many of our test scores are improving, reading scores in our fourth and fifth grades are declining.
They are now below the national average.
So we will embark on a program to reverse downward momentum, and we will put it in place early.
Eighty percent of all children who haven't attained the appropriate reading level by the end of third grade never catch up.
That is a sobering statistic considering that reading is the key to success in every area of learning and reading failure is almost completely preventable.
By the end of the 1999 school year, I propose that every first, second and third grader be tested.
If students are not reading at grade level, this state should provide them with an additional 30 days of school in summer classes no larger than seven students.
I'd like you to meet Kaylee Ann Woodward.
"(Kaylee Ann joins governor and reads from the TelePrompTer: ""This reading initiative is the centerpiece of an aggressive education agenda."
Thank you very much.
"Kaylee Ann is just six years old, a first-grader at Maeser Elementary in Provo, and for her seventh birthday I think I'm going to get her a copy of ""War and Peace."
Kaylee Ann was taught to read by her mother before she entered kindergarten.
She is an example of the best home and school cooperation.
But for too many elementary children, reading is an unpleasant chore they do not understand and cannot master.
We will fix that.
In addition to supplementary instruction, I propose dramatic increases in the level of training we provide teachers who teach reading.
I recommend age-appropriate materials be provided to assist children who lag behind.
And I propose an aggressive campaign to give new parents information so they can help prepare their children for reading long before they start school.
Just like Kaylee Ann.
I also call upon our communities to join together in partnership.
We need volunteers to go into our schools, take a child by the hand and help him or her through this stage of critical learning.
All will be worth the investment of time and money because the cost of solving our education problems is minuscule compared to he cost of doing nothing.
Competency, competency, competency – that's the second piece of the education initiative.
Too many of our students are completing their primary grades without the capacity to perform basic skills.
Our state has a core curriculum and standards directing what should be taught.
But to that we must add assessments to see if students are actually learning it.
I propose that every tenth-grade student starting in the year 2001 be given a basic skills exam to test in the areas of reading, writing, math and technology.
Demonstration of these skills must become a prerequisite for receiving a high school diploma.
Students who fail can take the exam again in the eleventh grade and again in the twelfth.
But if their class graduates and they have not passed, they will not receive a diploma, only a certificate of completion.
The door will always be open for a certificate holder to come back at any point to master the basic skills and trade up for a diploma.
A diploma must be a meaningful guarantee of competence, not just a verification of attendance.
In the 21st Century, we need to pick up the pace and velocity of learning at every level of education, and the state can provide some incentives for more students to do that.
I propose an exciting new scholarship called the New Century Scholarship.
Under this program, any student who achieves a two-year associate degree at the same time they complete their high school requirements will be given a scholarship for two more years at a four-year state college or university.
The value of the tuition alone is $15,000.
Many students are wasting major parts of their senior year not being challenged, having taken most of their required courses already.
Some goof off.
Others do what Sandra Clark did.
When Sandra graduated from San Juan High School last year, she got an Associate of Arts degree from the College of Eastern Utah at the same time she got her high school diploma.
At age 18, she is a university junior who will have a bachelor's degree in international business before she turns 20.
There are students all over the state doing the same thing.
More of them must be challenged.
The third piece of the education package focuses on middle schools.
The crossroads of education.
That head-spinning time when a kid suddenly determines he has too many teachers and not enough nose rings.
Our middle schools are becoming a place of distraction, overcrowded classrooms and outsized behavior.
There are few options now -- detention at $140 a day or sending them home and potential trouble like crime and teen pregnancy.
Last year, you funded a reduction in middle-school class sizes.
This year, we have to continue shrinking those classes.
I also propose the creation of a series of alternative schools with a highly supervised, structured environment designed specifically for students who refuse to keep the rules of society and are not yet ready to learn with the mainstream.
Number four is quality teaching.
Our schools are full of dedicated and remarkable teachers, most of whom work long hours, giving more than expected, being paid less than they are worth.
In a vast universe of good, there are a handful who do not meet the expectations of performance.
And frankly, we've made dismissing an ineffective teacher so hard it can take years.
Many administrators are just flat unwilling to try.
No one wants this problem solved more than good teachers.
This week I put that subject by e-mail to Utah's 20,000 teachers, and in just one day, over 1,000 responded.
The overwhelming majority favor taking action to strengthen teacher review.
During this session, I will support legislation that would provide principals with additional tools, and hopefully courage, to move when necessary.
HIGHER EDUCATION Our colleges and universities will be required to assume a greater role.
The realities of the Information Age will require that they rapidly and repeatedly deliver new levels of knowledge to every Utah worker.
By necessity, expectations will expand faster than budgets.
This is a problem faced worldwide.
Nations who balance the equation will be greatly advantaged in the 21st Century race for prosperity.
Our Board of Regents is currently engaged in the development of a new master plan.
They are faced with difficult questions about the role and mission of each campus, the place and realistic benefit of technology and the balancing of research and teaching.
To the Board of Regents, I say.
you must get this job done soon.
The world is not waiting for you, and the Utah Legislature cannot wait long either.
To the rest of us, I believe we must show the discipline necessary to refrain from actions that may seem at the moment to create equity, but in the long run may only memorialize inefficiency.
QUALITY GROWTH In this new world nothing is as certain in this state as growth.
Our population is expanding from within.
It is our children and our grandchildren.
But those choices are not without consequences as green fields become subdivisions and water supplies dwindle.
This is a moment in time to shape this generation's obligation and opportunity.
How will it be used?
Will we continue to grow without plan or purpose or will our course be guided by wisdom and logic.
Three-and-a-half years ago our state undertook a historic growth summit.
The result was the Centennial Highway Fund, a $3.8 billion dollar, 10-year statement of optimism and investment in transportation and community.
I-15 reconstruction has now hit the halfway point.
It is on schedule and on budget.
Other road projects are under way in nearly every county and city of the state.
Selection of an acceptable route has delayed Legacy Parkway.
But we must continue moving forward to plan the improvements that will sustain and outlast a generation.
That means we must expand I-15 and widen it in each direction between Salt Lake and Farmington.
Tonight I reference two additional steps that now follow.
The first is a community effort known as Envision Utah, a private-public partnership created to paint alternative pictures of what we want our communities to look like in the year 2020.
Tonight, I call on Utahns to participate, to view this as an obligation of citizenship.
The future is ours to define, but we must start with a vision.
A vision that represents the collective view of each and every Utahn.
This process will not produce a consensus, nor will the debate always be harmonious, but the discussion is an essential one.
Decisions must remain in the hands of local communities, city councils, county commissions and legislators.
But the decisions will be dramatically better when driven by an informed electorate with an eye focused clearly on the future.
The second step I've spoken of is the Quality Growth Act of 1999 a clear policy statement that we will preserve open space, reject sprawl and value housing for our families as a high priority.
There is dramatic need for an effort on the part of cities and towns to assure that all kinds of housing will be found in every community.
A good economy is a hollow victory if our children cannot afford to live in the town they grew up in.
Local control, central coordination, is the guiding principle.
SAFE STATE It is a given of growth that we will expand and change.
The upside to that is progress and a buoyant economy.
The downside is crime.
Since 1993, state government has increased crime-related budgets 81 percent.
We must continually expand prison space, address trends like the increasing number of violent juvenile offenders and seek new and better ways of prevention.
And we will.
Once again this year we will add more beds to our adult and juvenile facilities.
We will put more troopers on our highways armed with the modern tools of technology.
We will continue to push prevention and intervention through programs that make a difference.
Programs like the Third Judicial District's Drug Court, which combines intensive monitoring, treatment and personal accountability to give nonviolent drug offenders one shot and one final alternative to jail.
This year, we also have to fix an injustice in our corrections system by raising the pay of our corrections officers.
Currently we train and certify them, then offer them salaries 31 percent lower than the competitive wage paid by local law enforcement agencies.
We must retain officers like Sgt.
Ron Wilson, who stands between us and the dangerous in society as a maximum security officer at Utah State Prison.
I've walked those same corridors and looked into the faces of some of society's most troubled and violent people.
And I'm thankful for Ron and his colleagues.
They protect our kids but because of the pay situation cannot afford things like Junior Jazz or little league for their own kids.
That's a compelling reason to pay him and his colleagues more fairly.
CARING STATE A duty of compassion is as much an obligation as protection.
Last year, I outlined plans for a new Utah Child Welfare Foundation, a partnership of church, community, civic and state entities that would join forces to recruit and train more foster families.
This year I am proposing a $1 million appropriation so that we can meet our Utah's Promise goal of 3,000 foster families by the end of this decade.
Our resolve must continue to move more families from the cycle of dependency to self-sufficiency.
Since 1993, welfare caseloads have dropped from 20,900 to 11,500.
Our system has been improved by time-limiting benefits.
Welfare was never intended as a lifetime entitlement but as temporary assistance.
That has motivated 9,000 people to achieve self-sufficiency.
No one wants self-sufficiency more than this state and the people struggling to achieve it.
ENVIRONMENT Our willingness to confront challenges must now turn to the panorama of the environment.
Earlier this month, we celebrated the completion of the largest land exchange in the United States since the Louisiana Purchase; a state and national swap involving thousands of acres of school trust lands.
In the long term, this transaction will bring more than a billion dollars to Utah's school children.
In immediate terms, it has resolved a problem that plagued us for decades.
After years of stalemate, the solution arrived when state and national leaders partnered with local governments and environmental groups to zero in on a common goal and then build toward it.
The result is a showcase example of a new environmental doctrine called Enlibra -- a name formed of Latin derivatives and a concept born of the Western experience.
It means balance and stewardship, and it is in that spirit that we will apply it as formal policy in my administration.
There is one other area of environmental interest where a self-defeating trend is reversible and decades of divisiveness may soon be history.
Two years ago, I stood in this same spot and urged anyone ever sustained or smitten by our wild and scenic lands to start working toward an agreement on how to preserve them incrementally.
I proposed then that we accept gradual progress in the wilderness debate instead of forever delayed perfection.
Tonight, I renew that call.
All that is needed now are willing parties.
The solution, as we now know, can be found in cooperation, the best practices of the West and a clear path to achievement through balance and good stewardship.
NUCLEAR WASTE Another issue of land use, stewardship and public safety also is moving forward.
That is our vehement opposition to the storage of nuclear waste on lands controlled by the Goshute Indians in Utah's west desert.
This is a fight we entered at a disadvantage but one we will not abandon.
It is not the state of Utah versus a small, struggling Indian nation.
"It is one state slugging it out with 11 major utility companies eager to spend billions of dollars of ratepayer money to move high-level nuclear waste out of their yards into ours, where it would remain lethally ""hot"" from now until the year 11,999."
It is not fair to our people and our future, and we will not have it.
I'd like to announce that permission will not be granted for rail crossings in the area where operation requires state approval.
I also will support legislation this session to strip away an existing shield of limited liability protection and make utility companies directly liable for nuclear waste transportation.
"In addition, Congressman Jim Hansen has agreed to introduce federal legislation that would exchange state and BLM lands to form a ""moat"" around the Goshute ""island."
The drawbridge will be raised to the waste storage utilities and permission to cross refused .
. . no matter what the price.
This is a state of redrock castles, not spent fuel casks.
NATIONAL ISSUES Tonight Utah has other opportunities that reach beyond its borders.
Those include the Western Regional Primary, which will make this state and the West a player in a presidential nominating process that currently overlooks us.
By approving the primary date now set for March 10, 2000, the Legislature will ensure that Utah's voice is heard in determining the leader of the free world.
Tonight I have outlined the collective aspirations of a state and a people.
We are the proudest of Americans, the most irrepressible of individuals.
We know who we are: The cowboy entrepreneur.
A state of breathtaking landscapes and unflagging ideals.
The new Western heartland.
We are optimism, hope and expansiveness.
And underneath them all we are believers – in the worth of humanity and our obligation to uplift it.
Let me close now with an introduction to Jill and Carl Dastrup, who applied to become foster parents, underwent months of waiting and training, and when the call came to take a child said yes – not to one, but to five young children from a home that had failed them.
Out of an enormous capacity for love and a respect for the bond of siblings came permanent adoption.
And now four little brothers and a sister are growing up together in a home with health, security and loving parents.
This case is the happiest of endings for the Department of Human Services.
The Dastrups call it a miracle.
"Outside their children's rooms hangs a hand-stitched sign that reads, ""No act of love, however small, is ever wasted."
I'd like Jill and Carl to stand so the people of this state can see the faces of kindness and compassion.
There are no limits for a place with such people.
The 45th state was born of resolve and self-determination in a nation constituted by freedom.
We look ahead to the next horizon.
We vanquish setback by towering above it.
We turn our darkest moment into our finest hour.
That is the nature of America, and that is the character of Utah.
Thank you, good night, and may God bless Utah.
