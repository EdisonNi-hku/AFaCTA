Chief Judge Kaye, honorable members of the Court of Appeals, Lieutenant Governor Mary Donohue, Attorney General Spitzer, Comptroller McCall, Majority Leader Bruno, Speaker Silver, Leader Faso, Leader Connor, respected members of the Legislature, and distinguished guests.
Every year, for the past four years, I have started this address by acknowledging two women who mean more to me than anything in the world.
My priorities haven't changed.
Libby, mom, thank you for always being there when I need you most.
I cannot tell you how much it means to me.
And as I think of the wonderful family I am blessed with, I cannot help but think of the family members of our dear friends and colleagues who are not with us today.
Let us pause for a moment in memory of Senator Norm Levy, Senator Jess Present, and Assemblyman Tony Genovese.
As we begin this session, let me take a moment to express my deepest appreciation to all of you -- the men and women of this distinguished body.
Most of my time in Albany has been spent on the other side of this podium.
For 10 years, I sat where you sit today.
I know how demanding your job can be.
And I know how dedicated you are to the people of this state.
You serve them well, and I applaud each and every one of you.
When we met here four years ago, New York was in a period of crisis.
Our economy was failing.
Our people were bleak in spirit.
New York had fallen from the mantle of national leadership that is its legacy, and its destiny.
Seeking to reclaim that destiny, you and I forged a new beginning for New York -- renewing our purpose, our confidence, and the spirit of our people.
We have accomplished that.
We accomplished it because we had the courage to believe four years ago what we know today.
That New York's future grows bright when our people have the freedom to choose their own destiny.
That our state thrives on the determination of its people -- their desire to fulfill unfulfilled ambitions -- to dream, build, create, and unfurl the curiosity that leads to innovation, discovery and prosperity.
Today, New York's future is bright with hope.
But our renewal marks a beginning, not an end.
Before us is a great challenge -- unlike any challenge we've confronted before.
In less than a year, the world will enter the 21st century, the third millennium.
We must look beyond the symbolism of this milestone, and seize the opportunity it presents -- the opportunity to set the tone, the spirit, and the direction of a new century, a new millennium and a new era in the history of humankind.
Throughout time, that has been the way of things.
We saw it at the turn of the last century, when an explosion of ingenuity and optimism laid the foundation for a hundred years of unprecedented human progress.
Now, we stand on the threshold of a new era -- and it's in our hands to guide America into the uncharted territories of promise that it holds -- leading the way, onward and upward.
It is a destiny that is manifestly New York's to fulfill, for it requires a boldness of spirit that is inherent in our people.
I spoke about that spirit six days ago in my inaugural address.
It's a spirit that is glowing with strength and optimism, as we meet here today.
And we have every right to be optimistic.
In four years, we have overcome problems and obstacles that many people thought were insurmountable.
And in doing so, we have reminded ourselves that no challenge -- in our past or in our future -- can match the character, the fire, and the energy of our people.
So let us move forward today as we did four years ago -- with purpose and with confidence -- ready to test the untested, willing to try the untried.
"And always believing, as William Lloyd Garrison taught us, to believe in people ""above all institutions."
If we have the courage to do that, you and I will write a new era in history.
With this challenge before us, we must chart a course for the future that reaffirms, strengthens and advances the fundamental principle that is at the heart of New York's historic renewal -- the principle that our state draws its strength, its character and its greatness, from its people, and not its government.
Consistent with this, the deepest article of our faith, four years ago -- when New York was leading the nation in taxes -- we launched an aggressive tax plan with two parts: Cut taxes, then cut them again.
We have held firm to that plan, and to the sacred idea upon which it rests, which is that when government controls the economy, it controls the people.
Someone once said that taxes are a necessary evil.
They were half right.
By cutting taxes as much as we have, we've shown that much of this government's taxing wasn't necessary at all.
In just four years -- we've cut taxes 36 times, saving New Yorkers over $19 billion dollars.
We've cut income taxes on New York's working families, not once but three times.
And the result has been a strong economy that continues to grow stronger, because our people have more freedom to save, spend and invest.
Last year, we reinforced those income tax cuts with massive, across-the-board cuts in school property taxes for New York's senior citizens.
And in doing so -- in passing such an enormous and unprecedented tax cut -- our STAR program -- we unwittingly elicited a sense of disbelief among many of our people.
When seniors in Binghamton received school property tax bills of 0.00, they called the local assessor fearing they might actually go to jail.
The assessor in Catskill saw several seniors break out in tears after he explained that their tax bills -- showing they owed nothing -- were correct.
This summer, I received thousands of letters from senior citizens all across this state.
"And let me read you a portion of one that I received from Leila Campbell of Malone: ""I lost my husband three years ago, and when that happens you lose half your income each month, but you still have to pay your bills."
After heat, lights, phone, insurance, food, and doctor's bills, it's awful hard to pay taxes.
I still mourn the loss of my husband.
Now at least I won't worry about losing my home.
Let those words serve as a reminder that you and I hold a sacred trust -- that our decisions have the power to extend far beyond these walls and make a real difference in the daily lives of our people, providing comfort to those who truly need it, and touching people where they really live.
We have given our seniors the tax relief they deserve.
That was phase one.
Now comes phase two.
Starting this year, school property taxes will begin dropping -- and will continue to drop every year for the next three years -- for every homeowner in every corner and every community of New York State.
Fully implemented, the STAR program will return more than $2.7 billion in school property tax relief each year.
Four years of tax cuts have created stronger families, a stronger economy and a stronger New York.
Now, we must take bold steps to ensure that this government continues to live within its means.
To protect taxpayers now and in the future, we must make lower taxes and fiscal integrity the law of the land in New York State.
I will soon propose several measures to achieve that goal.
First, the act of raising taxes is a destructive act and should therefore be a difficult act.
That is why New York must have a constitutional amendment that says: if any Legislature wants to raise taxes on the people of New York; if state government wants to take more of the people's hard-earned money; if the bureaucracy wants to get bigger, and costlier, and wants the families of New York to pay for it, it can't do it easily.
It will take a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature for each and every state tax increase.
Now let me be clear: For as long as I'm governor, we won't need this law.
But we do need to get this law on the books, so that our commitment to lower taxes extends well into the future.
I urge you to pass this amendment.
This amendment will preserve the economic freedom of New Yorkers.
But it cannot stand alone.
It must be accompanied by our continued commitment to fiscal prudence.
In four years, we have cut taxes and created a stronger economy by suppressing government's built-in tendency to grow and spend.
The budget I submit to you at the end of this month will continue our commitment to fiscal prudence by holding next year's spending growth below the rate of inflation.
I urge you to adopt a budget that does the same.
We will end this year with a surplus in excess of $1 billion.
My budget plan will leave that entire budget surplus in a reserve fund to protect the tax cuts I've already signed into law.
New York's surplus doesn't belong to government, because it wasn't earned by government.
It was earned by the men and women who work for a living and pay their taxes.
By putting the people's money in a safe place where it can't be touched, we're taking the prudent step of guaranteeing that it gets returned to the taxpayers.
Finally, to preserve the integrity of our STAR plan, I will propose a stronger cap on spending that drives up school property taxes.
And that legislation will also include a provision requiring the vote of a two-thirds majority to raise taxes beyond the proposed cap.
We've already laid the foundation for a future of lower taxes.
The tax cuts you've passed and I've signed into law reach well into the next millennium, which means New York will commence the 21st Century the way it concluded the 20th Century: Leading the nation in cutting taxes!
Our commitment to cutting taxes is, first and foremost, a commitment to freedom, because we know that to deny people their economic freedom -- through excessive taxation or over regulation -- is to deny them their right to create opportunities and to pursue their dreams.
We know, further, that New York's economy thrives on the creative spirit of its people, not the taxing and regulatory spirit of their government.
"So when I took office, we undertook the giant task of reforming a government that was forcing jobs and opportunities out of New York with a policy that went something like this: ""Raise taxes, pass regulations, then impose a tax on the regulations."
In New York, government had become that uninvited dinner guest, who arrived too early, ate too much, and stayed too long.
The role of government should be like the role of a referee in a football game -- good referees -- not like the ones who officiated the last three Buffalo Bills games.
It should observe the game to ensure it's played fairly, but it shouldn't determine the outcome.
It's on the field when the action's taking place, but it has an obligation to stay out of the way.
It sets the basic rules of the game, but it doesn't call the plays.
It has a flag, but it doesn't throw that flag just to show the players who's boss.
In four years, we have returned this government to its proper role, its limited role.
We've made it smaller, smarter, more responsive, and less intrusive.
We've made it answerable to the people.
And we have loosened its grip on the free marketplace, creating a new business climate that encourages risk-taking, innovative thinking and the age-old spirit of enterprise that leads to economic growth and prosperity.
We've cut more than 30 job-killing taxes -- $4 billion in taxes -- on New York's businesses.
We've eliminated over 1,000 regulations that stifled creativity and discouraged economic growth.
We've reformed the workers compensation system, reducing rates by 36 percent.
We've brought competition into the energy markets, reducing rates on our people and our businesses by double digit amounts.
And this year, as part of our ongoing efforts to fuel the economic engines of New York's tourism industry, we will launch an unprecedented effort to restore and promote our state's historic landmarks.
Preserving the historic places that reunite us with our rich and glorious past is an obligation we must fulfill for the children of our future.
That is why I will propose legislation and funding to create a New York Heritage Trail.
From the French and Indian Wars to the American Revolution, from Fort Ticonderoga to the Erie Canal, from Washington's Headquarters in Newburgh to Walt Whitman's Birthplace on Long Island, from John Brown's Farm in Lake Placid to the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church in Buffalo, which served as a stop along the road to freedom through the underground railroad .
these are sacred places which tie us to our past and make us proud.
We must preserve and promote them for the world to see, fueling the engines of New York's second largest industry -- the tourism industry.
I ask you to join me in accepting this challenge.
But our past and our future are linked by more than just historical sites.
Last year, we completed the historic renovation of Grand Central Terminal.
We preserved Grand Central, not only as a museum to past glories, but with high hopes for the future -- with the vision of making it a part of our commitment to mass transit -- a living, breathing part of our economy.
Now, to advance that vision, let's redevelop, rehabilitate and restore another American landmark -- Penn Station.
Americas' busiest transportation facility -- busier than the world's three largest airports combined -- should be America's best.
And when our work is done, it will be.
With these and other initiatives, we will recommit ourselves to making New York the place where people from around the world come to gaze in wonder.
And in the process we will reinvigorate our tourism industry, create new jobs, revitalize mass transit, and build on our state's unprecedented economic renewal.
And we've laid a sound foundation on which to build.
In just four years, New York's economy -- strengthened by aggressive tax cuts and sensible regulatory reform -- has created more than 400,000 new private sector jobs.
Which means that, as we meet here today, more New Yorkers are working in good private sector jobs than ever before.
The course of history has run through New York.
So too must the course of the future.
To see that it does, we're exercising common sense instead of defying it.
Smart new initiatives like Chip Fab New York and Build Now New York are creating construction-ready sites so high-tech companies and other businesses can build, expand and create jobs quickly in New York, without being swarmed by bureaucrats and smothered in paperwork.
Both programs are moving ahead better than we could have expected.
Two Chip Fab sites are ready to go, with a third expected to be approved next week.
And as we speak, inspectors today are reviewing proposed Build Now sites in Dunkirk, Dansville, Buffalo, Bath and Big Flats.
Earlier this week, they were in Oswego, Syracuse, Newark and Ontario County.
And tomorrow they're going to Nichols and Oneonta.
In a month, we'll be selecting the 30 best Build Now construction-ready sites, bringing this unique job creation tool to virtually every corner of our state.
To add to that success, I will propose targeted tax incentive packages to make these and other development sites more attractive to businesses looking to expand and create jobs.
New York must compete -- and compete aggressively -- for high tech jobs, and one of the most fertile areas of high tech job creation is in biotechnology.
That's why today, I am proposing a plan that will make the City of Buffalo a national leader in biotechnology research and business development.
We will create a new Biotechnology Research Center at SUNY Buffalo, where the city and the state will work hand in hand with the university and Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
This center draws on the area's strengths: Excellent universities, a world class research hospital, and the tremendous presence of biotech industry and expertise from Toronto through Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.
And it will complement the highly successful biotech research park at SUNY Farmingdale --which we announced last spring -- and the SUNY Albany Biotech Incubator in Rensselaer County, which we will increase our support to this year.
This incubator plan will help grow new industries and new jobs for western New York, and new hope for the future.
Over the last four years, no state has cut taxes like New York.
No state has changed its regulatory climate like New York.
And no state has reversed its image with business like New York.
Companies are noticing, and we have 400,000 new private sector jobs to show for it.
Now, we must promote our successes to the rest of the nation.
The budget I submit to you later this month will include new funding for aggressive business marketing, which is crucial to job creation.
We need to promote New York's historic comeback to every business across the world -- from South Carolina to South America to South Korea -- so we can continue to create good, private-sector jobs for our people.
And as we continue to create good jobs, we must continue to do whatever it takes to ensure that the next generation of New Yorkers is prepared to fill them.
It's been said that children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.
That message, and indeed the future of our children, rests heavily on the choices we make today.
And, yes, the time for choice has arrived -- school choice.
The creation of charter schools in New York represents perhaps the single greatest change to our educational system in this century.
By passing this historic legislation, we're giving parents a freedom long denied them -- the freedom to choose where their child can get the best possible education within the public system.
Just as important, we have laid the foundation for a century of change, a century of new ideas, and a century of new solutions to old problems.
The interest is enormous.
The promise is unlimited.
The potential is immeasurable.
Now, we must turn that interest, that promise and that potential into reality.
We have the law, now let's use that law to make charter schools work -- for our children and for our future.
We passed charter schools on the premise that the only solutions that are guaranteed to fail are those we refuse to try.
Now, we must move forward in that same spirit, knowing, as we do, that it is impossible to embrace change with one arm, while clutching on to the status quo with the other.
In keeping with the age-old wisdom that language is the light of the mind, we must give all of New York's children the opportunity to become fluent in English.
Ambition, talent, tenacity, determination -- all of the wonderful qualities that people bring to this state from foreign lands -- are vastly undermined unless they are accompanied by a firm command of the English language.
That is why -- as part of my education package -- I will again propose giving parents the right to enroll their children in an English Immersion Program during the summer months, so that children who enrich this land with their diversity, can seize the limitless opportunities of New York in the 21st Century.
We demand -- and we have every right to demand -- only the highest standards for our children.
And we also have the right to demand that those high standards extend beyond the classroom of our schools and into the Principal's office .
Just as CEOs are accountable for the success or failure of their companies, the men and women who manage our schools must be held accountable if those schools fail to make the grade.
To shield principals from accountability is to condone failure -- and that is why we must end principal tenure this year.
And we must also take bold, swift and decisive action to combat school violence.
Our new Lieutenant Governor has a unique background.
She was a teacher, a District Attorney, a judge, and she continues to be a working mother.
That is why I have asked Mary Donohue to use her experience to attack the problem of school violence.
The Lieutenant Governor will chair a Task Force on School Violence comprised of parents, teachers, students, and law enforcement officials to develop aggressive new ways to rid our schools of violence.
While those recommendations are being developed, you and I must take the first step.
If a teacher spends a half hour disciplining one bad student, 20 good students have just been denied a half hour of learning.
That is wrong, and we must not stand for it.
Let's help the students who want to learn by giving teachers the power to remove the ones who refuse to learn.
Let's pass legislation giving teachers that authority this year.
These last four years have seen unprecedented investments in our children's education.
We've given schools record resources, but we've also raised standards and expectations, so that children have the tools they need to learn.
And we've given schools record funding for construction and repairs.
We've invested more than $900 million in state dollars just this year in school construction.
In New York City alone, we're spending $1.2 billion this year and $1.3 billion next year in state and city funds for school construction.
That's four times the amount that was allocated in 1996.
Now, we must ensure the public's investment in school construction is protected.
Today, I propose the creation of a new unit within the Dormitory Authority -- the School Facilities Development Unit -- that will provide school districts with lower borrowing and construction costs, technical assistance and long overdue mandate relief -- including relief from the Wick's Law.
This new unit will strengthen our investment and provide guarantees that our record funding is being used for one purpose and one purpose only: To give our children the best possible facilities in which to learn and grow.
This legislation -- and all of the education initiatives I send to you this year -- represent positive and dramatic change that will improve our schools, stimulate the creation of new ideas, and help us to develop the talents of our children.
But there can be no progress without action.
By establishing charter schools, you have shown that you have the courage to inject bold new ideas into an education system that, too often, resists bold new ideas.
I applaud you for putting our children's interests first, and now I ask you to pass these initiatives and do it again.
And in protecting the interests of our children, what could be more important than ensuring they have access to medical care?
In four years, we've taken bold steps to ensure that no child in this state is denied health care.
New York leads the nation in providing comprehensive health care to our children.
Today, more than 260,000 children are covered by the Child Health Plus program.
That's an increase of more than 100,000 children since I addressed you last year.
And we're enrolling an additional ten thousand children into the program every month.
We've done well.
Now let's do more.
To complement the success of Child Health Plus, we must broaden our prevention efforts by attacking the diseases that threaten the health of our children.
Coping with chronic disease is difficult at any age, but it's especially difficult when you're a child.
Managing diseases like asthma and diabetes take a tremendous toll on both the child and the parent.
And, too often, diseases like asthma take a disproportionate toll on low income children in urban areas.
That is why we must intensify our fight against both diseases.
Working with community organizations, health care providers, insurers, and families, we will launch pilot projects in high incidence areas of the state like the Bronx, Manhattan and Buffalo to provide asthmatic children with the care they need.
We will also conduct a comprehensive statewide education campaign to help teachers, parents and children become more aware of asthma and the factors that trigger its dangerous attacks.
Another fight that demands the full force of our efforts is the fight against childhood diabetes.
Managing and monitoring this disease is absolutely crucial, but it's not easy.
It requires children to undergo daily shots and blood tests, while maintaining rigid diet and medication instructions.
Parents do a wonderful job, but they can't do it alone, especially when their children are at school.
So this year, we will launch initiatives in our schools aimed at giving children with diabetes the support they need, while giving parents the peace of mind they deserve.
We will develop new tools to help children with diabetes maintain their strict daily regimens and control their disease so they can live normal, healthy and happy lives.
To build on the dramatic success of Child Health Plus, I ask you to support these measures -- because keeping our children healthy is not an option; it's an obligation.
Protecting our children from violent crime is more than an obligation.
It's the highest duty entrusted to us, and the most fundamental function of government.
Four years ago, we sought to reform a criminal justice system that underscored a basic truth -- that weak laws are an incentive for crime.
At the time, New York was leading the nation in violent crime.
And not by coincidence, New York was leading the nation in the mass production of theories on the root causes of crime.
When I stood here four years ago, I made it clear that when it comes to saving lives, we cannot risk the safety of our people on the word of a flimsy excuse.
Voices were raised, telling us that putting violent criminals in prison is a simple solution to a complex problem.
That is absolutely correct.
It is a simple solution, which is precisely why we have embraced it.
The laws we've passed are based on the simple logic that a violent criminal can't be in two places at one time -- that if he's in prison, he can't be out on our streets turning innocent people into helpless victims.
Our no-nonsense approach to fighting crime is working.
In just four years, New York's rate of violent crime has dropped to its lowest level since 1970.
That's a remarkable accomplishment.
Now we must build on it.
Four years ago, when I addressed you for the first time, I asked you to end parole for repeat violent felons.
We accomplished that, and the rate of violent crime has continued to drop every year since.
Last year, I asked you to pass Jenna's Law and end parole for all violent felons.
We have accomplished that as well.
And many more lives will be saved as a result.
Now, we must take the next and last step in reforming our system of parole.
We must end it.
Forty percent of all felons return to their criminal ways and return to prison within three years of their release.
Forty percent!
And that's just the ones who get caught.
Experts predict that the real number is well over 50 percent.
And so, we must ask ourselves: Knowing that so many criminals are likely to commit another crime after they're released, where do we want them to be?
In prison, or standing on a sidewalk next to a child?
There's only one right answer to that question.
Which is why I will soon be sending you legislation that will end parole for all felons.
I will also propose expanding the jurisdiction of our state's DNA data bank so we can use the full force of today's technology against criminals.
In the years since our DNA data bank was created, technology advances have greatly expanded the ability of police and prosecutors to prove crimes and solve crimes through DNA.
But under current law, only 8 percent of convicted felons are required to submit DNA samples to our state's data bank.
Why only 8 percent?
There's no logical reason.
Felons convicted of burglary don't have to submit to DNA testing.
This makes no sense.
And criminals who've been convicted of attempting to commit violent felonies don't have to submit to DNA testing either.
This makes even less sense.
Essentially, it's a technicality that rewards criminals for being incompetent.
These legal loopholes are begging to be closed.
Let's close them.
The expansion of our state's DNA database will do for law enforcement in the 21st Century what fingerprinting did for law enforcement at the turn of the last century.
It will give police the upper hand.
Which is why I will propose legislation to expand New York State's DNA data bank by more than 10 times by including all felonies and attempted felonies.
And I sincerely hope that you and I can come together this year -- and send a clear message to the perpetrators of hate and intolerance.
Violence rooted in bigotry and racism is a cancer on our society that threatens to tear apart the bonds of unity that we work so hard to nurture.
I'm confident that, working together, you and I can pass a Bias Crime Law by the end of this year.
We must also take bold, swift and decisive steps to protect our women and children from sexual predators.
I don't need to tell you about recidivism rates.
You and I both know that sexual predators simply are not deterred.
The only way to rehabilitate them is to incarcerate them.
The Senate acted on this measure last year with an overwhelming majority.
I urge the State Assembly to do the same this year, and pass the Sexual Assault Reform Act.
I urge you, also, to change the laws that allow young criminals to commit violent acts with virtual impunity.
We must crack down on vicious criminals whose only defense from justice is their birth certificate.
Any law that grants an unconditional pardon based on age is an assault on our people and on the rule of law itself.
Many of you in this chamber have spoken eloquently and passionately on the need for Juvenile Justice Reform.
I would simply suggest to you today that well done is better than well said.
Let's get the job done this year.
Again, the Assembly should follow the Senate's lead and pass our Juvenile Justice Reform bill.
New York leads the nation in fighting crime because we had the courage to take on a criminal justice system that was failing.
And New York leads the nation in reducing the welfare rolls because we had the courage to take on a system of government dependency that strikes at the very principles upon which our country was founded.
The sweeping reforms we've made to the welfare system are rooted in a fundamental truth: However noble the intentions, we cannot help people by doing for them what they can and should be doing for themselves.
We have reformed the welfare system carefully, compassionately, and intelligently.
By emphasizing work.
By providing crucial assistance, like child and health care.
By weeding out fraud and abuse.
By forcing deadbeat parents to fulfill their financial obligations to their children.
And by remembering that the only limitations in life are those we impose upon ourselves -- or, when it comes to welfare -- those that are imposed on us by government.
The results have been remarkable.
In just four years, we have reduced our state's welfare rolls by more than 607,000 people.
That's a 36 percent reduction, bringing New York's welfare caseload to its lowest level since 1968.
This is an historic achievement.
But we must never be content with yesterday's progress, however great.
Last September, we launched an aggressive and effective welfare to work initiative called Built On Pride.
Unlike past programs that often provided outdated training for jobs that didn't exist.
Built On Pride trains people for jobs that do exist, and are waiting to be filled.
Working with the Urban League of Northeastern New York, we're providing hands-on training in a wide range of construction trades.
Plumbing.
Carpentry.
Electrical work.
Skills that are always in high demand.
Once they have completed that training, we will put them to work as skilled workers, renovating publicly owned properties in their own communities.
And from there -- armed with the skills they've learned and the confidence they've earned -- they can go wherever their dreams lead them.
Through our partnership with the Urban League, Built On Pride is working here in Albany, where former welfare recipients are using their new skills to revitalize Arbor Hill.
Now, we must forge similar partnerships with community groups across the state to make it work in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Brooklyn and in every town, village, city and borough in between.
I will ask you to pass legislation to make Built on Pride a statewide initiative.
But let me be clear: In forging solutions for the future, we must not repeat the mistakes of the past.
It is not my intention -- nor should it be yours -- to create more government programs that never die.
My intention is to develop effective programs that fulfill their purpose and then render themselves obsolete.
Built On Pride is a wonderful program, but it is a temporary program -- due to expire when the last welfare check has been redeemed, and the last New Yorker has shaken free from government dependency and walked through the door of opportunity, into a lifetime of independence.
Now if that sound like an impossible goal, I would simply remind you of two things.
Much of what you and I have accomplished over the past four years was said to be impossible when we first proposed it.
I would also remind you that, over the past four years, the number of people on welfare has only gone in one direction -- down.
The welfare rolls have never fluctuated, never drifted upward, not even slightly.
They have only gone down, and they continue to go down as we meet here today.
It will take time, and it will require our continued vigilance.
But make no mistake about what we have accomplished: In just four years, we have laid the foundation for ending welfare dependency.
We can create jobs -- and we have.
We can create safer communities -- and we have.
We can create better schools and charter schools -- and we have.
We can create opportunities -- and we have.
But we cannot create wilderness.
We cannot create nature.
We cannot create the pristine beauty of an environment lost to neglect.
But we can preserve it -- for ourselves, our children and generations to come.
No state in the nation has done more in that regard than New York.
We lead the nation in cleaning up our water and air.
We're leading the charge for safe and sensible national air pollution standards to protect public health and our natural resources.
And when it comes to preserving open space, we have set an example for the rest of the nation to follow.
Just last month, we announced the largest land conservation agreement in state history -- preserving more than 144,000 acres.
This opens some of the most spectacular wild rivers in North America to the public for the first time in more than a century, while preserving jobs vital to the North Country's economy.
But our open space protection efforts aren't limited to wilderness areas.
Last year, we reached agreement to protect Mount Loretto on Staten Island.
And we broke ground on the first phase of Hudson River Park on the west side of Manhattan.
New York has an environmental record that no state in the nation can touch.
Let's make it better.
This year, I will once again propose that we fully fund the Environmental Protection Fund.
As we acquire more lands and open them up to the public, we must preserve their beauty, protect their wildlife habitat and maintain their recreational facilities.
To fulfill these obligations, I will once again propose dedicating millions of dollars from the Environmental Protection Fund for the stewardship of new lands entrusted to our care.
We've made remarkable strides in cleaning up brownfield sites and returning them to the tax rolls.
This year, we will intensify that effort, moving swiftly and aggressively to breathe new life into contaminated properties all across New York State.
Using recommendations from our working group that brought environmentalists and business leaders together, I will propose legislation to refinance and improve our State Superfund program.
I will also propose reforms to the Superfund law that will give the state the authority to clean up hazardous substance sites that are precluded under the current law.
The fact that these sites are excluded in the first place makes no sense.
Let's add that to the list of government loopholes that need to be eliminated this year.
Also, we need more sensible and effective cleanup standards -- and we need to ensure that cleanups happen quickly.
And make no mistake: Any proposal to refinance and improve the Superfund will maintain tough standards.
Those who pollute will pay for the cleanup.
And this year, we will set aside $50 million to continue our historic progress in cleaning up the Long Island Sound.
And we will not stop until Long Island Sound is the wonderful resource that it should be for the people of Long Island and New York State.
And we must build on the initiatives we've already undertaken to preserve the beautiful Hudson River.
After decades of neglect, the Hudson is finally receiving the care that it deserves.
Two years ago, we launched the first comprehensive plan to study, restore and permanently protect the Hudson River Estuary.
This year, we must guarantee that the Hudson's fate never falls victim to future leaders who don't share our commitment to its preservation.
That is why I will propose legislation to establish a Hudson River Estuary Trust Account -- a permanent, dedicated account within the State Environmental Protection Fund that will support research, restoration, and protection programs for implementation of the Hudson River Estuary Plan.
It is impossible to compress an entire year's agenda into one speech.
So let me just briefly touch on some of the additional issues that demand our attention this year.
We need to expand our efforts to track down and recover child support from deadbeat parents.
We need to strengthen our domestic violence laws even further than we already have.
We need to empower prosecutors with tougher laws that will allow them to track down drug kingpins and put them in prison.
We need meaningful court reform, and we need to clean up the political process with campaign finance reform.
We need to keep the doors of our schools open until 7 o'clock by expanding Advantage Schools.
"And we need to clean up the air we breathe inside, as well as outside, by providing tax credits for businesses that create environmentally sound ""green buildings."
In the weeks and months to come, I will send you legislation that addresses these and other issues, and I urge you act on them.
New York is leading the nation in preserving the environment.
Leading the nation in fighting crime.
Leading the nation in reducing welfare.
Leading the nation in cutting taxes.
Leading America into a new century of hope and opportunity.
We have done well.
We have shown that we have the courage to bring about change for the good of ourselves and our children.
And for that we can be proud.
But do we have the courage to seek change for our children's children?
Do we have the courage to seek change that will reach beyond our lives, and into the far end of time?
Do we have the courage to believe that we can affect history?
If we convince ourselves that New York is the best that it can be, if we convince ourselves that we've changed all that needs changing, if we convince ourselves that the prosperous times we've created are prosperous enough, then we draw bounds around a people who are boundless, and place limits on a destiny that is limitless.
But if we have the wisdom to understand that we are only as good as what we leave behind, then one day what you and I do here will help to fulfill the dreams of a child we'll never know, in a time we'll never see.
I believe we can do that, because I believe in the spirit I spoke of six days ago -- the spirit of New York.
It is the birthright of a people who are not given to simply marking time or believing that any dream is beyond their grasp.
It is what moves us forward, and determines the measure of our greatness, and the promise of our future.
We can inspire and nurture that spirit.
But we do not guide it.
It guides us.
For a time, New York's spirit was bleak.
But throughout our history it has always endured, leading us to bigger dreams and brighter days.
And so, today I'm proud to report that the state of the state is as strong as the spirit of our people.
In this, the season of hope, it is glowing with optimism, casting light on the threshold of the door to tomorrow.
Thank you.
God bless you and God bless the people of New York.
