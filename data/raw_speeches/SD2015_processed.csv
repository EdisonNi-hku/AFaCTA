SENTENCES
course for these high school students.
A local business has agreed to offer them internships.
"In Burke, grant money was used to purchase four mobile CTE classrooms used by students from four school districts in that area for CTE classes in architecture and construction, engineering, biomedical science, and welding."
"Without collaboration among those four districts, sections would have been too small to warrant a teacher for each of thesecourses."
"The Mitchell school district is renovating and expanding their regional career center which will provide students from Hanson, Mount Vernon, Ethan, Sanborn Central,and the Mitchell district more opportunities to take CTE classes like welding, blueprint reading,or to get certified OSHA training."
Aberdeen is building a similar center.
"In Yankton, 8 students completed a Certified Nurse Assistant Camp, 22 students completed a manufacturing academy, and 14 students completed an automotive academy."
"Thirteen of those students were from Wagner, Bon Homme, Irene-Wakonda, and Menno districts."
"Even as we strengthen our offerings in high school, we know that, more than ever, it’s important to encourage our young people beyond high school."
"Last year, I proposed and you approved a new low-costdual credit program to allow high school juniors and seniors to earn university or techschoolcredit for courses that also count toward high school graduation for only $40 a credit hour."
I’m very pleased that this dual credit program has been enthusiastically accepted by our schools and students.
We talked about it at the budget address.
The enrollment has been well beyond expectations.
"In the fall semester of the 2014 school year, students from more than 100 public school districts, 1 tribal school, 8 private schools, along with a few homeschoolers enrolled in dual credit courses."
"Over 1,000 high school students, these are junior and seniors only,enrolled in classes from College Algebra, to Composition, to Diesel Engines.And they are doing well."
These high school students enrolled in college and tech school courses have a pass rate greater than 90 percent.
"As I’ve said before, dual credit is a win-win-win-win."
"High school graduates who start college or tech school with some credits already under their belts are more likely to complete on time, and at less cost."
"Universities and technical schoolsget the opportunity to make themselves known to prospective students, and to help prepare those students for success when they graduate."
High schools gain flexibility to offer more opportunities to those students at no cost to the district.
"And,the state gets more young people who are ready to succeed,and live,and work here in South Dakota."
Another key focus in workforce ishealthcare workforce.
And we are making real progressthere as well.
Over the past few years we’ve expanded rural health worker incentiveprograms and increased the capacity of our health care educational programs.
"This fall, the expanded medical school class begins."
"The expansion will be fully implemented by 2018, training 60 more medical students in our state than before."
"We’ve also funded a program that provides students in medicine, pharmacy, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner programs with four-week experiences in a rural setting to give them a taste of rural practice."
"This year, I’m proposing to expand that program to allow up to 30 students to participate inup to 15 rural sites."
"I’m also proposing we expand eligibility to include clinical psychology, masters of social work,and medical laboratory science students."
We won’t see the impact of these programs and others like them overnight.
These are long-term solutions that require ongoing commitment.
The healthcare providers in South Dakota and I are committed to addressing these issues.
"As a final workforce focus, I’m particularly proud that we are making strides in our efforts to offer employment opportunities to persons with disabilities."
"State agencies are partnering with rehabilitation services and school districts to provide worksites for Project Skills program, which provides paid work opportunities for students with disabilities."
"Students get valuable work experience, and businesses get solid workers."
We have also eliminated a financial disincentive in one of our Medicaid programs for those with disabilities who want to work.
These earlier efforts are achieving good results as more people with disabilities enter the workforce.
"For example,99percentof South Dakotans with visual impairments who sought state help in finding competitive employment, not workshop employment,but competitiveemployment,were successful."
That compares to a national rate of just 89percent.
"All of these workforce efforts are important, because, thanks to South Dakota’s business-friendly climate, we continue to enjoy a strong economy that is adding jobs:Consumers Supply announced the construction of a new, state-of-the-art facility in North Sioux City."
"The plant will produce bagged, pelleted, or texturized feeds, and vitamin premixes."
"3M announced a $57.6 million expansion in Brookings includinga 44,000 square-foot addition and 60 new jobs at the medical products facility."
"Also in Brookings, Bel Brands cut the ribbon on a $144 million, 170,000square-foot state-of-the-art facility."
Thelargest industrial capital expenditure in Bel Group’s history.
"Ag Growth International announced a new 120,000 square-footHi Roller production facility in Sioux Falls."
"The Norwegian company, Sapa Extrusions, recently announced the expansion of its operations in Yankton, and the company will be adding 50 jobsthere."
"Landsport of Sturgis, which supplies aluminum loading ramps for the trucking industry, announced they would nearly double their manufacturing footprint."
Award winning technology company Sterling Computers announced their company is relocating its corporate headquarters from Nebraska to Dakota Dunes.
The state has also continued efforts to promote development in the agriculture sector.
"Using local control as the starting point, our County Site Analysis Program helps counties use data to proactively identify sites suitable for agriculture-related development."
The program was first developed and implemented by the South Dakota Department of Agriculture in partnership with the First District Association of Local Governments and Development District III.
"The County Site Analysis Program looks at local zoning ordinances, defined by the county, locationsof roads, utilities, and other infrastructure, and combines this with local permitting requirements."
"This information is used to rate property locations on their suitability for manufacturing, or commodity processing,or livestock-related enterprises."
"County commissions, planning and zoning boards, and landowners then use this data to make well-informed decisions."
"Investments in agriculture are vital to the long-term sustainability of rural communities, but development must be done responsibly."
"Not every new project is a good fit in every location, so the program helps county commissioners and landowners determine where projects fit best."
"Sinceitslaunch a year ago, 48 counties, more than we expected, have requested a site analysis, and we have completed the analysis in 15 of them."
"In those counties, local leaders use the data in their comprehensive planning efforts; landowners have concrete information outlining options for their land; and agribusinesses learn where their investments will be welcome."
"I am proud of this program,andI am pleased that the National Association of Development Organizations recently awarded thisprogram an “Innovation Award” for its novel approach to rural economic development."
"I am also very proud that, just last month, a Colorado State University study named South Dakota the #1 agribusiness-friendly state in the nation."
"Of course, South Dakota values the outdoors for more than agriculturealone."
"We emphasize responsible conservation because we love our hunting, our fishing, and our outdoor recreation."
"Two years ago, the Legislature approved the creation of Good Earth State Park in southeast South Dakota."
"The park has already welcomed new visitors from South Dakota, Iowa, and elsewhere, and work is being doneto design and build a new visitor center."
"On the other side of the state, bids on the construction of anew Custer State Park Visitor Center will go out this month."
"Located east of the Game Lodge at the intersection of Highway 16A and the Wildlife Loop Road, this new facility will be situated perfectly to draw visitors."
"This $5 million facility would not be possible without the generosity of the Leona Helmsley Foundation and the James and Eloise Elmen Foundation, which,together provided $3 million toward the cost."
We are also taking steps to protect our pheasant hunting heritage.
"In 2013, we were confronted with a worrisome drop in pheasant numbers."
"Of course last year, the numbers bounced back with a 76percentincrease."
"Even so, the decline in grassland and CRP acres over the last decade poses a significant challenge to maintaining our strong pheasant hunting tradition."
"That’s why I hosted the Pheasant Habitat Summit in December of 2013 and appointed a work group to evaluate the hundreds of comments, suggestions,and letters that resulted from it."
"The work group produced a final report that included a series of practical recommendations, and I have already taken steps to implement some of them."
"One of the primary recommendations was the establishment of the South Dakota Conservation Fund, dedicated to providing financial resources directly to conservation efforts, including pheasant habitat."
"Tim Kessler, who was a member of the work group, donated $100,000personallyto launch the fund, and since then others have been stepping forward to contribute."
"In my budget, I proposed a one-time, $1.5 million appropriation to stimulate matching contributions from the private sector to help improve habitat in South Dakota."
"Every yearat this time, I alsoreport to you on our “Better Government” initiatives to make the government more efficient, more open, and more accessible."
I’d like to briefly do that todayas well.
"Two years ago, the rules promulgation process for state agencies was public, but if itwas onlineat all, it was difficult to find."
"So the state launched a single-portal website to help citizens find,follow, and engage with therulemakingprocess."
"Just last week, we extended that concept to another area –Executive Branch boards and commissions."
This new portal –boardsandcommissions.sd.
"gov–is a one-stop site listing board members, meeting notices, agendas, and board packets."
"Much of this was onlinebefore, but it was spread among dozens of different websites and difficult to find."
The new portal will make it easier for the public to engage with over 100 boards and commissions.
My administration has also worked on “red tape repealer” efforts.
"Over the past four years, we have proposed and you have passed the elimination of 3,700 sections of obsolete and unnecessary laws and rules, accounting for 411,000 words."
I know from my time as a legislator that much time is often spent adding words to the statute books.
I thank you for helping remove some words as well.
"This year, 11 departments and my office will be introducing 16 more bills to eliminate an additional 305 sections,over 26,000 words,from our laws and rules."
I’d also like to update you on our continued efforts to reduce infant mortality.
"When I was first elected, I was dismayed to learn how many infants were not reaching their first birthday, and that South Dakota’s infant mortality rate was higher than thesurrounding states."
"I asked my wife, Linda,who is here, to lead a task force on this important issue."
"Our first lady worked with doctors, nurses, tribal health officials, nurse midwives, social workers,and the Department of Health officials to understandthe causes of the problem."
Private donors have partnered with the Department of Health since then to provide Safe Sleep Kits to low-income families without a safe sleep option.
"The kit includes a portable crib, crib sheet, sleep sack, informational DVD,children’s book,and pacifier."
"So far, 4,630 parents and other caregivers have received these cribs.I know what they are like."
We went out and bought one for use with our grandkids when they are at our house.
"A media campaign,“For Baby’s Sake”,is focused on safe sleep, early signs of pregnancy, the importance of prenatal care, and the importance of immunizations for babies."
The Facebook page has reachednearly half a million unique visitors.
"The website receives, on average, nearly 3,000 pageviews each month,and 79percentof thosevisits are new,meaning it’s not the same handful of folks revisiting the site."
Significant progress has been made.
"We don’t have 2014 numbers yet, but Linda was just telling me today reporting now is being mademonthly, so we will soon have 2014 numbers."
"South Dakota’s 2013 infant mortality rate was 6.5 deaths per 1,000, which is a decrease from 2012’s rate."
"That’s 6.5 down from 8.6, so a pretty significant drop."
I am happy we’re seeing improvements.
Iknow there’s still more work to do.
There’s no fixing this problem overnight.
I am grateful Lindawill continue to lead our state’s efforts to reduce infant mortality in the next four years.
"Since September 11, 2001, each of South Dakota’s 22 National Guard communities has experienced a unit mobilization in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn,and Noble Eagle."
"To date, the South Dakota National Guard has deployed more than 7,200 Soldiers and Airmen in support of the Global War on Terror."
"Today, as I speak to you for the first time in more than a decade, no Soldiers or Airmen are currently deployed overseasfromSouth Dakota –no National Guard Soldiers or Airmen."
"Of course, the National Guard also serves an important role here at home, and the Guard stepped up again in 2014."
"In June, 114 guardsmen provided sandbagging and levee construction support, along the Big Sioux River in Union County."
"Just days later, 268 soldiers with vehicles and equipment were activated to support tornado recovery operations in Wessington Springs."
It’s not surprising that the South Dakota National Guard continues to be recognized for excellence.We have a great Air Guard.
"The 114th Fighter Wing earned Air Combat Command’s first overall “highly effective” grade during a Unit Effectiveness Inspection, and our 114th Fighter Wing was presented the highly-coveted Spaatz Trophy, which is presented annually to the most outstanding flying unit in the nation–our South Dakota Air National Guard."
"Twelve Army National Guard units received the National Guard Bureau’s Superior Unit Award, which is presented only to units that meet very highstandards in drill attendance, physical fitness, weapons qualifications,and maintenance."
"The Forward Support Company, the 153rd Engineer Battalion,won the army award for maintenance excellenceandfor distinction in maintenance operationsin the small maintenance category."
"And,the 153rdEngineer Battalion for achieving the highest standards for training and readiness was awarded the Major GeneralMilton A. Reckord Trophy as the most outstanding Army National Guard battalion in the nation."
It’s been apretty good year for our South Dakota National Guard.
"I described these awards, of course, because it is important we honor those who serve in uniform and recognize the sacrifices they make for our nationand for our state."
"We must alsoremember the sacrifices of those who have worn the uniform in the past, our veterans."
"Last year at this time, the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs kicked off “Operation Reaching All Veterans”."
This is the first kindof operation of this type in the nation.
"The Department set a goal to reach out to South Dakota’s veterans with a multi-pronged approach, not wait for veterans to contact us."
"We reached out and contacted them using an outreach booth here at the Capitol during the session, open houses in all 66 counties, and an aggressive phone campaign."
This campaign was a first for the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs and a first in the nation.
"The Department started with a list of over 62,000 veterans."
Not all veterans are registered withthe state.
We may not know of their existence at even the county level.
"Media messages in print and electronic formats were distributed,and 153 open houses were held throughout the state."
"Starting last April,our staff and veterans service officers around the state were each given a list of 100 veterans to contact everymonth."
"This effortallowed staffto educateveterans andtheirfamiliesaboutbenefits, programs,and services."
More importantly it allowed us to listen to concerns and provide key contacts to assist on a local level.
"Best of all, itgave us a chance to say“thankyou."
"One county veterans service officer, Tom Sparrow of Turner County, contacted over 11,000 veteranspersonally.Tom is here today.Please help me thank Tom."
"Nextyear, our veterans will have a new home."
"Thank you again for joiningwithme to provide funding for the new state veterans home, and thank you for your ongoing support of this project."
Construction is on time and under budget.
Our goal is to open the doors to thisnew home in January of next year.
"We are able to be here today because of the service of these brave men and women, and we honor their sacrifices by doing what we can to make South Dakota even stronger."
Many of you know that I have focused on our state’s bond ratings.
"Recently, Standard and Poor’s upgraded South Dakota’s outlook from “neutral” to “positive."
"In doing this, they recognized our state for “prudent fiscal management and structural budgetary balance.That’s their words."
They also noted our state’s strong economic growth and pro-business tax climate.
That rating is important because it can save our state money in interest payments.
"I also value it, though, because through outside scrutiny we can identify ways that we canimprove."
I am very proud of the many steps we have taken to be good stewards of thisstate.
"Four years ago, we joined together to eliminate our structural deficit."
"It took tough choices, but we are stronger today because we balanced thebudget."
"Likewise,we joined together two years ago to reform our criminal justice system."
"It took courage to rely on evidence and data rather than instinct, anecdotes, and conventional wisdom."
But we are already saving money because of those decisions.
We have joined together to use one-time dollars to pay off debts and strengthen our financial position.
We have joined together to become one of the few states in the nation with a fully-funded pension.
We have joined together to maintain public buildings and to preserveour outdoors.
"We have joined together to create jobs through the Building South Dakota bill, and to enact programs to train the workers who will fill those jobs."
"And, when our neighbors face disaster –when they face one of the worst days of their lives–we have stood with them –we’ve joined together to stand with them –whether a tornado in Wessington Springs, a blizzard in cattle country, or a massive river flood."
"This year, this session, we confront the challenge of transportation funding and the opportunity for reform in our juvenile justice system."
"Once again, we can join together to strengthen our state and ensure that our best days are yet to come.Let’s go to work.Thank you."
