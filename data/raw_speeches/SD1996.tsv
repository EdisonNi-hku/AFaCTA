Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Madam Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, Mr. Speaker Krautschun, you ladies and gentlemen of the Legislature, and you ladies and gentlemen of South Dakota.
I really appreciate the opportunity to be involved in the tradition of making this State-of-the-State Address to the South Dakota Legislature and to the people of South Dakota.
As I start today, I'd like to recognize, really a special lady.
Joy Krautschun, the wife of the Speaker of the House, is here with us today.
She's a lady who befell immense medical tragedy over the course of the last year.
Frankly, as I became aware, first from news reports and then from first-hand reports, of the incredible condition and tragedy that had befallen her, it was truly heartwarming to see the outpouring of friendship and support of all you ladies and gentlemen in the Legislature and, frankly, the people of South Dakota.
To watch, one, that Krautschun family stay together and really focus internally as a family, and two, to know that everybody, everybody did what they could, as Joy, you did your incredible effort of moving forward to provide yourself with the rehabilitation and the improvement in your medical condition.
And I say it because Joy Krautschun, with her determination, with her effort, and with her tenacity, and Harvey and the kids as they came together as a family, really epitomize those kinds of things that we tell the rest of the people of the world are unique things about the people of South Dakota and its overall family-all the people of this state.
So Joy, Godspeed, and we're so fortunate that you're here today, and you're on the road to recovery.
You know, as I start off today, I can't help but think we are already leaving and we just got here.
But where we're leaving for is where we're always leaving for at the time that any governor has the privilege to come before you to make a State-of-the-State Address.
We're talking about the future-and that's where we're leaving to.
Today I'd like to talk for just a little bit about our journey into the future.
I'd like to really share with you the perspectives that we put together both from my personal and professional, as well as my political judgments, as to where we're at and where we'd like to go in the State of South Dakota.
But before I start into the future, I'd really like to mention a couple things of the past, just that have taken place in this land of what we call infinite variety over the course of last year.
They're tidbits of trivia that added together really draw the picture of what makes this truly not just the place of infinite variety, but it makes South Dakota a truly unique place.
The federal government once again failed to figure out how to balance its budget within the next seven years.
We, in South Dakota, for the 106th time, last year in 1995, figured out how to have a balanced budget and to do it on time within the framework of what our people could afford.
The federal Congress passed the largest tax increase in the history of America.
The State of South Dakota's Legislature passed the largest tax decrease in the history of South Dakota.
Our temperature ranged from 107 degrees in July to minus 15 last March, and I can't help but reflect, the older I get, how I can remember when I was young it used to really get cold.
You know, a January ice storm during the time the Legislature was in session came, and it destroyed 2,156 electrical poles on a north/south basis through the central part of the state.
It left 9,000 homes without electricity.
In October, we had another blizzard that stretched from an area around Gregory and Winner all the way to Britton and Sisseton on a diagonal angle that destroyed 8,670 electrical poles and left 31,000 households without electricity.
For both of those storms, the total number of people that called the Governor's office to complain about service or help were two.
Only two individuals, of all those people affected, bothered to call to complain.
The rest of them put their hearty, pioneer, South Dakota spirit to work and made do with the tragedy that they were facing.
We had an earthquake that hit South Dakota that was 3.7 on the Richter scale with the epicenter up near Sisseton, about 15 miles away.
It finally made me, at 56 years of age, finally figure out that we at least had one thing in common with the State of California.
My former pal, Rudy Perpich, passed away.
He and I came to know each other in a border war many years ago when he said South Dakota was last in everything.
Over the course of the next several years, he and I enjoyed engaging in, really, the dialog of public debate-debating the relative merits of our two states.
But there was one thing that I remember saying to Rudy that I used to always tell him about every time I was with him.
He was right about one thing.
He said we didn't have professional sports.
And that's the one place where South Dakota and Minnesota were the same, because they didn't have professional baseball or football either.
You know, in July of the past year-in July of the last year, we recorded our one millionth visitor on South Dakota's home page on the Internet.
As of about two weeks ago, we recorded our two millionth visitor that looked up South Dakota's home page on the Internet.
The second Verendrye plate was found by a dog, and then the dog's owner threw it away.
The Corps of Engineers once again told us, as they always have, that we had to send our water downstream irrespective of what it did to our state.
Well, we finally figured out that we would do what they told us, and then they came and told us not to send our water downstream, irrespective of what it did to our state.
But, I finally now also understand that we've learned a valuable lesson from the Corps of Engineers and that is that not everything runs downhill.
For the first time since I can remember, I went a whole year without a speeding ticket, and so then the federal government goes ahead and abolishes speed limits.
According to the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, the highest concentration of hunters that we have in our state lives in the area around Britton-but the highest concentration of deer we have in our state lives in Rapid City.
We had a gentleman by the name of Corky Sandsmark from Lake City; he went hunting.
With his rifle scope, he got a deer right in his cross hairs; he squeezed the trigger; and it went through the deer and hit a second deer.
And he shot two deer with the one shot; and, believe it or not, he had two licenses, and he is 90 years old.
In January of last year, the Sioux Falls Lincoln basketball team was three and seven and going nowhere.
By state tournament time, they came home with the state championship.
Last year in December, the O'Gorman girls basketball team had a losing season up until that date.
They were seeded last in the state tournament , and they came home from the state tournament with a state championship.
My friend Ron Volesky called me a coward and my friend Rick Hauffe from the Democratic Party Executive Committee analogized me to the devil, and neither one of them got their head slammed into a locker.
At the State Fairgrounds, we commemorated the 50th Anniversary of the participation of South Dakota's men and women in the war effort.
The involvement, as I did the research preparing for that day, really made me understand the responsibility that every one of us, as elected officials have, to what it means to be involved in public service.
At one point in time, 64,000 men and women in South Dakota were in the armed forces.
Statistically, 20 percent, or one out of every five men in this state, were in uniform at the same time on the day that the second World War ended.
And agricultural production in South Dakota broke every previous record up until that point in time with the few men and all the women and others who stayed home and put their backs to the yoke and did the work.
Today, as I speak, there's a group of South Dakotans serving in Bosnia, having been called to active duty to go over and once again do this country's work in terms of foreign policy and in terms of national defense.
As a matter of fact, the commander of that unit is Lieutenant Gerlach who serves as a budget analyst in our budget office who's not with us during this session, because he and the other seven members of his unit are currently serving in Bosnia.
We had a young man named Robert Etbauer who's the World Champion Saddle Bronc Rider, who, in a competition, had a thumb torn off when a horse stepped on it.
He calmly, in the arena, picked up the thumb and went out and went and sought medical attention, and they reattached the thumb.
"And when he was asked about it, he said, ""There wasn't much else that I could do."
I guess I could have rolled around in the arena and screamed.
And there's another lady here today that I'd like to introduce you all to.
Bonnie Gaikowski, would you please stand up for just a second, Bonnie?
I want you all to just turn around and look at this lady for a second, and get a good look at her.
Thank you Bonnie, you can sit down.
Now I'm going to tell you why.
Last spring when all these floods were going on in northeast South Dakota, I went up and attended a community meeting in Webster at the National Guard Armory.
At the conclusion of that meeting, and frankly, there were an awful lot of sad, frustrated people who didn't complain, who just wondered how things could be done to help them face the future.
When that meeting was over, I went over to the lunchroom in a cafe.
I was with a friend of mine, former Senator Curt Jones from Britton, who had come down, and I was with Senator Lee Schoenbeck and Jeff Fox from my staff.
And as I sat in the caf√©, this lady came over and visited with Schoenbeck, and when she did, Lee introduced me to her.
As I sat there and visited with her, they explained to me that that morning she had shot 27 of her cows.
And I couldn't understand why she would have done that, and she explained that they had, I believe it was, hoof rot from having been in the water, and she'd had to shoot 27 of them.
And then, as we visited and I looked at this lady-and, frankly, I could tell this was a lady-you could just see it in her flesh that she'd spent her entire life working, her entire life not whining and sniveling but working.
She's a widow and her dream was to turn the farm over to her two sons, and that's what she was in the process of doing, and then the water came.
And it continued to rise, and it continued to rise, and they finally had to evacuate all the machinery from the place.
And they had to evacuate all the livestock.
A lot of it was in the water , and that's where they had this trouble where they had to be shot.
It virtually wiped her out.
I said to her how sorry I felt, and, really, just how sick I was to my stomach just listening to a tale like that from somebody who'd never asked for much and had spent their whole life just fulfilling the dreams that they wanted to pursue in their family.
"And she said to me, ""Oh, Governor, it isn't that bad."
Just think, I'm lucky that we weren't in Oklahoma City.
And I honestly couldn't help but be taken by that comment.
With all the troubles this lady had, she just wanted to let me know that there were people that had a lot more troubles than she did.
And I came back to the office and I sent her a letter telling her how thankful I was I'd had a chance to meet her, and, frankly, what the meeting of her had done for me.
She wrote me back and told me in a facetious way that maybe she could turn the farm into a resort.
Maybe we could stock some fish in it and it could become a fishing haven.
"And in her humor for the PS she said, ""Governor, what weekend can I book for you at the Gaikowski Resort?"""
But you know, Bonnie, what you did for me was you made me understand why I love being the Governor of this state and why every one of these 105 Legislators loves being involved as Legislators and in public service and in the public process.
Because it's really people like Bonnie that we represent.
The people that don't snivel and don't whine and don't complain and don't always have their hand out and aren't always looking for something and always trying to find the political advantage and always trying to back someone into a corner, but who want the right to pursue their own destiny, their own way, and they want us to provide some assistance and some interference for them so they can develop themselves as human beings and not live off the taxpayers but be a taxpayer.
Bonnie, I can tell you that you epitomize the real people that all 105 of these Legislators and Bill Janklow have a responsibility to look out for as we pursue the next several weeks in the course of this legislative session.
You know, South Dakota's in a state of constant change, and, historically, in this state we have values that our people have had that've really defied the assault of time.
It's one of the things that we really like to think makes us a little bit different, and in some instances, a lot different from a lot of the rest of the people in America.
But in the years ahead, these values are going to have to be our guide; because we're going to go someplace together, or we're all going to go no place together; and the choice is truly ours.
You know, when a Governor gives a State-of-the-State Address, it's usually got some nice little phrases in it and then some partisan comments.
Today there'll be no partisan comments-one, because I don't have the stomach for it, and two, the people of South Dakota are fed up with it.
They're tired of game playing.
They're tired of finger pointing.
What they really want are solutions and answers and help to problems, most of which they've had no hand in creating.
Most of the problems that we have have been as a result, one way or another, of governments having taken the wrong direction or governments having taken no direction or governments having not moved at all.
Today I'm going to discuss a few of the bills that I'm going to have introduced on our behalf-that I'm going to ask the Legislature to pass.
But, what I'd really like to focus on as I visit with you today is to talk about the state of the state.
Where are we at?
Why?
Where are we going?
I'm going to give you a glimpse of a few things that we will be working on even without legislative intervention, because we have the authority under the existing framework of the Constitution and the laws.
Just a couple months ago, I submitted to you a budget that was called a taxpayers' budget.
That's what we named it.
And I'd like to recap, if I can for just a couple of minutes, some of the things that we had in that budget, if I can find my laser pointer.
Well, I'll do it without my laser pointer.
The reduced FTEs in our budget-we reduced the FTEs by 755 people in our recommendation, and that was a 5.4 percent reduction.
We decreased spending in our recommendation by $10 million.
We fulfilled the 20 percent, $83 million property tax reduction for calendar year 1996, and I'm going to go into that in some detail today, because every explanation I publicly see by people in the elective process, as well as those who are recipients of the money, have a different explanation as to what we did and what its impact is.
So if we're going to agree or disagree, it's incredibly important that we agree or disagree on the basis of the correct facts, and then we can go from there.
Ninety-five percent of all the general fund increases that we're recommending will go into the property tax relief program through state aid to education.
What did the 1995 Legislature and our office accomplish?
As you can see for calendar year (CY) '96, the calendar year that we're currently in, we froze property taxes payable to the taxing entity at calendar year 1995 levels.
We provided a 20 percent credit on property taxes payable in 1996, to owners of property that were classified as agricultural land or owner-occupied single-family dwellings.
As you can see on the blue for calendar year 1997 and thereafter, we set a new maximum property tax levy for the general support of education.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is an incredible accomplishment.
It truly was revolutionary in terms of what we did.
We limited the ability of counties and cities and townships to increase their total property taxes payable to 3 percent or the rate of inflation-whichever was less.
And, ladies and gentlemen, that was truly revolutionary.
You see, all of us, when we're out talking to the real people of South Dakota-the taxpayers-we mouth the fact that we're for holding down the growth of government, we're for restraining the growth of government, but then we have the tendency, occasionally, when we get before some special interest groups, to mouth to them how we're really going to increase their expenditures.
And the third thing we did was we created a new state aid and special education set of formulas.
Again, folks, that was truly, truly revolutionary.
For the first time in the history of South Dakota, in the general fund sense, we are putting the same amount of economic wealth behind every single kid in this state, no matter what their color or what geographical area they come from or their circumstance in terms of general fund spending.
The property tax impact for calendar year 1996, and this is the taxing entity being the counties, the cities, the townships and the schools.
For 1996, as I said, the property taxes payable were limited to the 1995 level with the following exceptions.
And that's all.
One, special education in those school districts that had not been being applied at the maximum mill levy under law was allowed to be raised to the maximum mill levy.
That's one of only five ways that any property taxes could go up.
Two, new construction which would not affect existing home owners unless they added new construction to their property.
Other than that, new construction in a community where a new home was built or a new business was put up or whatever, could be involved in going on the tax roles.
But, for homeowners, they would have had to have had new construction to increase their tax bill.
The third way that it could be increased over calendar year '95 was if there were new bonds or new capital outlays.
In terms of a bond, it would have taken a vote of the people.
As you all know, school bond issues require a vote of the people.
The capital outlay certificates within the framework of what's authorized for school boards does not involve a vote of the people.
But only if you live in a school district where they increased capital outlay payments would you be affected by it.
And the scheduled increases in bond or capital outlay payments could be added-and by that I mean, let's say you have a bond issue in your school district, and you pay $100,000 principal and interest the first year, and under your schedule it will escalate on an annual basis.
The escalation portion-and there are very, very few districts that do business this way-but the escalating portion could be added into the base.
And in those counties-and it's approximately half of them-that had not previously, during the video lottery freeze, that had not previously rolled the personal property tax program into their levies because they felt that the money wouldn't be coming-half the counties did it and half of them didn't.
Those counties that had not done it, the Legislature and I authorized those counties to add that into their base.
That's the only way it could be increased.
A lot of questions have come up about it, but if you look at people's 1996 bill that they're paying now, there should be a 20 percent reduction on that bill from what the total is.
If that is not the case, then there is an error being made in the way it's being calculated, because the increase from '95 to '96, under these special circumstances, we agreed in our legislation, we would pick up 20 percent of the cost of that increase only for those limited circumstances where it could be increased.
The owners of agricultural property and single-family, owner-occupied dwellings, as I said, receive a 20 percent credit on their taxes payable for CY96.
This may not be a 20 percent reduction from '95 for any individual taxpayer, and the reason is because of these five factors up here which may operate in some of the districts or one other factor, and that is, the properties are continuously being assessed and reassessed and some may be going up in value but, correspondingly, any that go up in value, there has to be an offset for some going down in value, because we limited taxes payable for calendar year 1996.
Then we get into the whole Average Daily Membership (ADM) discussion.
And again, I think there's a lot of confusion as to what the facts are.
What was the Fiscal Year 1994 total spending per ADM by the fund?
I've read a lot of articles where some school people are saying, We can't educate kids on $3,350.
Well, first of all, the $3,350 doesn't even get to them until next year under the proposed budget.
But over and above that, no school district, even when we passed this law, was trying to educate any kid on $3,350.
What we were talking about were the general fund expenditures.
And using 1993 ADM of 132,000 kids-and the reason we used '93 when we passed the law is that '94-'95 was not available.
It wasn't there yet and so we used 1993 ADM of 132,000 kids.
If the general fund, at that time, was about $3,029-and I'll get to that in a few minutes on another chart, but the average expenditure statewide at the time we passed the law was $3,731 in general fund expenditures behind the average child.
There was $501, in addition, going behind the average child for all kids of $501 broken out of the average per kid, and there was $462 in other funds, leaving a total spending statewide average for all children for their education during the course of last year, $4,694.
This $3,731 breakdown breaks out to $3,039-and you're going to see that figure again in another chart in just a minute-plus $692 in non-state--aid-formula general fund resources which nobody in the state has been talking about in terms of the availability of their resources for their education.
What are the revenue sources for the schools?
Here they are.
That's every revenue source that we can figure out is available to schools.
What you see up there in yellow is money that comes locally starting with ad valorem taxes, which are property taxes, and the yellow parts of the chart and the first column is what can go into the general fund.
The second column with Xs is what can go into the special education fund, and the third column shows what can be spent for other areas other than general fund or special education.
What you see in blue are what counties contribute to the educational system.
What you see in green is what the State of South Dakota contributes to the educational system, and what you see in blue is what the federal government contributes to the educational system.
Now, what makes this chart important is that, when we talk about general fund expenditures in state aid to education, we are talking about the first line ad valorem taxes in yellow, and we are talking about the first line in green, which is state aid, and we're not talking about another single thing with respect to all the areas where you see Xs that can go into the general fund of schools; and it's very important that we keep that in mind, that when we say general fund, that's not the amount of money we anticipate it takes, or should take, or will take to educate a child.
It's a portion of the funding to which we apply state aid.
Now where did the figure $3,350 come from that everybody's talking about, that, beginning in July 1st of this year, will be the state aid guaranteed portion of general fund support behind every child?
We took the '93-'94 school year, which was the numbers that were available, because '94-'95 was happening when the Legislature was here, so we had to take '93-'94.
The total expenditures were $491 million.
To that we gave a bonus.
We added in the depreciation on buses, which is just a cash flow item that we added in, so we added $2 million to the base.
We then added in the depreciation on advanced technology-again a bonus on a cash-flow basis, and then we added in non-allowable special ed expenditures which totaled just $63 thousand.
We then subtracted out from the total of $491 million, $697,000, which was the total amount that was being spent by all the school districts under general funds for adult education, considering that that wasn't part of K-12 for the kids.
We subtracted out the lease.
There was one of those leases in the state.
There was an attempt to circumvent and get around the state law under the old state-aid formula.
And we subtracted out summer school expenditures feeling that that was not an ordinary expenditure for general fund obligation for the school year.
That left us with $493 million.
What you see here in blue, the $91 million we subtracted.
What is blue?
It's everything on that chart over there that's now sitting in front of the Attorney General, Mr. Butler, and Mrs. Schoenfelder.
It's everything on that chart that is not state aid or property taxes, and that totaled $91 million.
We took that out.
We didn't tag anybody with it.
That left $402 million that we called local need.
We then took our '92-'93 ADM of 132,408 kids, we divided the bottom number, 132,000 into $402 million, and that gave us $3,039 a child, and now we all knew what it cost us in general fund expenditures per child average statewide in South Dakota.
Now, the bottom part of this chart-I wish these numbers were bigger but let me try and stab at them here.
Take the $3,039, and we arbitrarily said we're going to assume, through this transition period, that we're going to have 3.3 percent rate of inflation.
Well, frankly, we haven't had 3.3 percent rate of inflation, and as you'll see in a few minutes, it's meant a multimillion dollar bonus to the school systems, which is fine.
But we said we're going to, because we had to assume something over a transition period, so we gave the benefit of the doubt and said it'll grow by 3.3 percent a year in inflation.
If you compound 3.3 percent for the three years to $3,700, that got us to our $3,350 for calendar year 1997, so that's where the number comes from.
It's taking reality of last year and turning it into, through the transition period, to the year 1997.
The next chart that we have shows you what it would have been like, what was reality, what we did, and what we would have been at.
Now these are three scenarios based upon red being what the schools were doing, blue being what the Legislature passed, and green being what you would have done if we would have put it to true inflation, as it turns out, looking behind us to what's gone on in the last year in inflation.
Starting with the base of $3,039-and nobody can argue about that, that's an absolute number just based off of simple mathematics-applying the 3.3 percent growth factor, that took us to $3,127 for the year that we were in.
It took us to $3,200-again expanding $3,127-it took us to $3,243, and it takes us to $3,350 on the green one.
I'm sorry, if we had done actual inflation, we would have given $3,127 which would have grown to $3,215 which, in reality, we would have paid out $3,305.
Now that seems like only $45 per kid.
The difference between $3,305 and $3,350 is $45 per kid.
Multiply that times 133,000 kids, and you come up with $6 million that, in reality, our state aid should be less if we were sticking it with inflation, but we're not proposing to do that.
We're going to stay the course on what it is that the Legislature passed.
Under actual spending, what you can see is the schools were continuing to grow in excess at the rate of inflation per ADM and, frankly, the legislation reigned that in.
Schools can still now grow at excess of the rate of inflation and all they have to do is get permission of the people that will pay the extra bill.
The property tax owners of the levels of agriculture and homeowners and commercial within the framework of the school district where they live.
Nothing unreasonable about that.
So, is there more than just $3,350?
I previously have shown you the FY94 chart-I showed you that one before.
For FY97-and notice there's a star after each of those numbers-for FY97, the total statewide average at a minimum will be $5,065 behind the average school kid in South Dakota, which consists of $462 other which we previously had, $561 in special education-as opposed to $501, a $60 increase which I'll get to in a minute-and $4,042 in general fund expenditures instead of $3,700.
And why do I have the three stars under FY97?
Because this chart, total spending of $5,065 assumes that that chart that's still up over there, not a single item in blue, it assumes, and not a single item in green, it assumes, except state aid, and not a single item in purple, and not a single item in the yellow with the exception of property taxes, will increase during the entire transition period that we're going through this.
So, if any single item over there on that chart that's still up about revenue sources, if any item increases for a school district over and above state aid and property taxes, this number, the $5,065 number, will have to be a higher number on average behind every kid.
Have we achieved statewide equalization?
That's really the bottom line question.
And the answer is, in spades.
If we take the first chart that I'm showing you here, or the first column, we're assuming a high value district, and we're using the same base ADM for both school districts, because we have to compare apples to apples.
In the high value school district, you can see that we'll get to our $3,350 in state aid using a significant portion of property taxes and a lesser amount of state aid.
And for a school district that has low value, we will give a significantly greater dollar amount in state aid to make sure that it's $3,350 in general fund expenditures behind every kid by 1997.
Then I hear a lot of rhetoric, and, frankly, that's what it is, about picking on small schools.
So let's lay the facts out and then we can argue about them, but we have to agree on the facts.
The circle on the left represents the school districts in South Dakota.
We have 600 students or more-and if you remember in the formula that you passed, the break line was at 600 students; school districts that have 600 students or more represent 44 school districts in South Dakota.
Of the 177 districts, 44 of them have more than 600 kids.
They will get no bonus under the state aid formula.
Every one child will equal one child.
For the school districts that have more than 200 students but less than 600 students-that's all the blue-those are 89 of our 176 school districts.
Those 89 districts that have more than 200 and less than 600 will all get a premium subsidy over and above the $3,350 per student from 1 percent, a bonus, up to 19 percent, depending on the size of the school district.
The closer to 600 total students they get, the smaller the subsidy, and the chart represented in red is exactly, as it turns out, the same number in green.
Forty-four school districts have fewer than 200 students.
Those school districts will receive a bonus of 20 percent, and what that means mathematically is for every five kids in their school district, we're going to pay them for six.
There going to have a ghost student for every five that we will subsidize them and pretend it's six in the state aid formula.
The linear regression chart, which you all became familiar with during the session last year, reflects what I've just explained.
The bottom of the chart represents students and the top of the chart represents dollars, and what that really tells us is in school districts below 200, all 44 of those districts will receive-they can forget the number $3,350, should never use it again, because they're starting out at over $4,000 per kid is where they're starting out in the state aid formula.
The only schools in the whole state that should be talking $3,350 are those that have in excess of 600 students in the school system, because every other school system in the state gets a proportional subsidy that breaks off at under 200 students.
I said I'd come to special ed in a second.
Let's understand what we did in special education.
If you take the 1994 actual-and when I use the year, I mean the Fiscal Year-actual spending, it was $66 million.
We took out the non-formula revenues.
What are the non-formula revenues?
Everything over on this chart that I'm leaving up except state aid and property taxes.
We excluded, from special education so that they wouldn't have it counted against them even though they get the money, the $12 million of non-formula revenues.
We then subtracted out the $1.5 million plus kitty, which really was based off of a percentage, 5.75 percent, that we had put aside for extraordinary expenses that impact extraordinary things in school districts.
The example that was used, if we take a smaller school district, which by reason of statistics or tragedy ends up with an overabundance of severe problem or difficult-to-educate special education kids, for extraordinary expenses that impact extraordinary things in school districts.
The example that was used, if we take a smaller school district which, by reason of statistics or tragedy ends up with an overabundance of severe difficult-to-educate special education kids, it could overtax them as a burden.
So we agreed to create a statewide pool, and we set 5.75 percent aside.
Subtract those two out, we got $52 million for special education.
Now, lets go to the green part of the box.
We had, actually, 15,621 kids in FY94 in special education in South Dakota.
For what we classify as mild disabilities, we had 13,600, which is 10 1/4 percent of all the kids in school; 10 1/4 percent of about 132,000 - 133,000 kids.
We decided to call them equal to one child.
If they were mildly disabled we called them one.
So that gave us 13,600 of them.
For those that were severe, we have 1981, and that represents 1 1/2 percent of all the kids in the educational system in South Dakota.
We arbitrarily gave them a 12 and we said the cost of them equals 12 times the cost of the average student without these disabilities-a huge ratio.
So, if you take the 12 times the number of students, we fictitiously created 22,000-plus more students, or we made a total of 23,000 even though there was only 1900 of them.
So instead of 1562, we pretend we have 37,000 more students in the K-12 education system.
If we take that 37,400 number and we divide it into the $52 million, we come up with $1400 per child.
Now, if you take the number of kids and it is a factor of one, and multiply it times 1400, you come up with the weighted factor number.
We took the ones that were severe and we multiplied them by 12, and that tells us that we had to add $16,800 for every single one of those students.
We totaled those together, and that's where we come up with our special ed number.
Now, how do we get to the number for '97?
The $1400 figure and the $16,000 figure, these two figures, for mild and severe, we created arbitrary inflation of 4.85 percent.
Now, it hasn't even been three since you were here last time, but we pretended it would grow at 4.85 percent; and if you grow by 4.85 the base number, then the $1400 figure becomes $1600 and the $16,800 becomes $19,364 for CY97.
So now, if I can go back to that chart 9 I think it is Tyler, for one second.
Now, we gave you the general fund explanation; I kept the other the same; but, as you can see, there is $501 behind every kid for special ed.
Not just the special ed kids; that's $1400 or $16,000, but average statewide for every kid, $501 is being spent; and, because of this new formula, if you divide that total number as I just gave you into the total number of all students in South Dakota, it adds sixty additional dollars per student or more than a 10 percent increase over the three-year period of time, because we compounded it at 4.8 percent.
We are going to ask the Legislature to do some fine tuning with the legislation that we passed.
Frankly, when you do anything this massive, you have problems.
Some of them were designed, not by us, but by others for political purposes, and some of them, I think, were just things that slipped us all.
There currently is a, what people claim to be a, reorganization disincentive.
Let me give you an example.
Because we give this huge bonus to the tiniest school systems, we count them as six for every five, if you take one school system with 190 students and another school system with 190 students, between them they have 380.
If they merge together, they will go past the 200 limit and fall into the declining bonus or declining subsidy field.
They get a greater subsidy by staying separate.
So they claim there is a disincentive to get together and work.
Now that is interesting because only in government, my friends, will you ever find people who claim-only people who live off taxpayers will ever claim-there is a disincentive to consolidate or merge or work together or cooperate or get more productive.
You all do it everyday in your operations.
You farmers that expand your operation and buy more farm ground, you figure out how to do it without phasing it in over three years.
Anybody that's ever bought two businesses and merged them together, they can figure out how to do it.
But, I recognize it's a fundamental law of government; you can't do it when you're spending taxpayers' money.
So we are going to ask the Legislature to pass a law that gives a phased-in period of time over a couple of years for those school districts who feel there's a disincentive for those of them that want to talk together about working together to consolidate their services or portions of their operations.
There was a special cap factor that was passed this year that affected a couple of school districts for special education.
We are asking the Legislature to revisit that issue and make a policy decision as to what is truly the wish of the people in that regard.
Frankly, we had a oversight last year that never came up in the discussions that I was aware of.
It is probably as much my fault as anybody's.
The discretionary levies and TIFs that take place within your local units of government, the way we structured our new law, everybody will pay for what local governments decide to do.
By that I mean, let's say that a new business is going to come-and I'll just mention Pierre because we are here.
Let's say that Pierre wants to attract a new business, and they're willing to give them discretionary levies.
Under the law, as you know, it can go zero taxes the first year and then twenty and then forty and then sixty and eighty, over a five-to-six year period of time, it can phase in.
If the Pierre Community decides they want to give a property tax break as an incentive to a new business, you folks who live in Britton and you folks who live in Vermillion and you folks in Rapid City and Sisseton, should not pay for Pierre's policy.
So, we are asking that when the decision is made on a discretionary levy for economic development purposes that that count against the community or be added in as a portion of their local effort.
The same thing is true for tax increment financing districts.
The identical thing is true.
Instead of having public development for water and sewer and curbs and gutters and street and municipal utilities and things of that nature, they'll let the private sector go do it.
And then they'll let the private sector take a credit against their taxes every year until they've been repaid for that development.
The way the law is currently written, people who do TIFs will have everybody in South Dakota paying for them for their community.
So, we have to fine tune it, and we are asking the Legislature to fix that.
We are asking you to pass a uniform election process for referrals of the elections if commissioners or city council officials or school officials by a two-thirds vote raise their mill levies as is authorized under the law.
Because of the time that it takes to get an election under the law and then certify it and all that stuff, vis-√†-vis when governments apply their new budgets, we are asking that the Legislature set the date of August 10th as the cutoff date within which if there's going to be two-thirds votes by any governing body to expand the levies beyond what's statutorily created, it be done by August 11th so that there can be the opportunity for the taxpayers in the area, if they choose, to have the matter remanded.
We are asking for a paperwork reduction in how the property tax reduction is applied.
For ag property it is easy, because we know what the classification is.
The homeowner's situation is where the difficulty arises.
And now, presumably, everybody has filed.
So we are asking that the law be changed to say that for those people that have filed, and honestly filed, that they do not have to file again unless and until there's a change in the use of their property, i. e. we move out of our house and we start to rent it, or there's a change of ownership in the property.
If any one of those two circumstances occurs, then people should be required to recertify at the courthouse, but absent that, people should not have to go through the paperwork process any longer.
I can tell you, notwithstanding the few stories and criticisms there were about it, it was a Herculean effort by the local county assessors offices and the local officials to get done what they got done in the past year.
Frankly, they did an incredible job, really a commendable job in everybody working together to get it done, notwithstanding the fact that we had some hookers in the way we were operating it, but everybody came together and it got straightened out.
We are asking that we now pass legislation to reduce all the paperwork and the hassle.
For sales tax exemptions, we've got some problems.
One of them was the truckers' tax.
The Legislature has made the policy decision with respect to the truckers' tax by having used the SIC Codes-and I am fully aware of the political games that can be played with this.
But the reality is, if we are going to pass legislation, whether you like it or don't, if we're going to have it, we have to have it in such a manner and in such a way that it is clearly understandable by the public; it's clearly able to be delineated, and people can comply with it and operate under it.
So, on that basis, we are submitting legislation to straighten out those particular types of problems.
We've historically had a set of programs that deal with tax rebates to the elderly and the handicapped.
I am asking the Legislature to change that law this year.
We will be submitting legislation over the next several days that asks the Legislature to eliminate that particular program, and that we pass a new program in its place.
Spending all the money that has heretofore been allocated to a select few group of people, albeit many of them in need, but to use it to leverage other state programs and funding, other local programs and funding, and other federal programs and funding.
So we are going to ask the Legislature to reallocate it into transportation programs for the handicapped and the elderly, 24-hour-intervention care programs, homemaker program expansion, adult day care, medication reduction, volunteer service bank expansion, respite care, assistive devices and home modifications, RSVP programs, and home services for the developmentally disabled.
What we are asking the Legislature to do is, take that program that benefits a couple thousand people and let's turn it into a program that benefits many thousands of people, integrating it into the system of programs that we currently have operating, not just by the state government, but by county government, municipal government, and federal government programs.
For lowering the levies, this is a unique problem.
I'm just going to take a second with it to explain to you where the problem is, because we are going to get it fixed.
What 's important on this chart is the 47-53 percent.
The law we passed said that for estimated state aid for the second half of '97, 47 percent of it would come from state aid-this is in general fund expenditures for schools, and 53 percent would come from property taxes.
That's the ratio we ended up with.
Under the way the law is written now-and, frankly, it was not the intent of this Legislature, there was an amendment offered by, I believe it was Representative Cutler, it was passed by the Legislature, and the bill as it was finally passed and signed into the law does not reflect what your wishes were.
The desire was to maintain that ratio.
Because property tax valuations have risen faster since you've gone home than what was anticipated, and because the number of students in the school system has not risen as rapidly as we thought it would, by applying the real numbers, state aid would go down to 44 percent from 47 percent, and property taxes would now assume 56 percent as opposed to 53 percent.
It seems like a small percentage but it's a multimillion dollar impact.
So, we are asking that you pass legislation that takes care of the problem for this year and then puts into place for the foreseeable years an automatic trigger that will maintain the balance of 47 percent of coming from state aid for the general fund receipts, and 53 percent from property taxes into the general fund receipts for schools.
The next chart, you've seen before.
This is the strongest pitch I can make to you on behalf of the taxpayers of this state.
And I am going to make it every day that I'm in a discussion about this until the day I'm out of public life.
If we go back to 1987, these are total property tax increases from the previous year.
Statewide in South Dakota in 1987, property taxes only rose $15 million.
In 1988, they rose $19 million.
In 1989, they rose $15 million.
Then came the two years of what I'll call the Mickelson tax freeze.
As you know, there was an exception built into it, people could opt out, plus they had the growth factors from new growth coming with new construction, additions to property, new property, etc.
The net result was property tax collections went up $4 million during the freeze, and they went up $8 million the second year in 1991 of the freeze.
Now, we all heard, all of us, about how everybody was being strangled.
Interestingly enough, our citizens have been able to figure out over the years how to get by year to year without increases when they aren't there.
Government never has figured it out.
We all campaign on that platform, but then we forget it when the election is over, all of us.
But if you take the average of 15, 19, and 15, you come up with somewhere where, over a three-year blended average, property taxes were raising about $16.5 or $17 million a year.
Then we played the game, everybody said catch up.
We have to catch up, and catch up we did.
We went up $48 million in one year.
Now you can blend that over a three-of-four-or-five-year moving average, or clearly a three-year moving average; 48 plus 8 is 56, plus 4 is $60 million, divided by three is $20 million.
But one year of catch up gave you a three-year moving average higher than the previous three years.
But lo and behold, the next year everybody still wanted to play catch up.
So our taxes went up $50 million locally.
And I guess they were still in catch up the third year, because they went up $46 million.
Well, cumulatively speaking, 15 and 15 is 30 and 19 is 49 million, let's say 50 million, they went up for three years.
Then they went up 50 million and 48 million, that's 98 million plus another 46, so it's about 140-145 million, about $140 million worth of increases in three years, versus 50 million.
Somehow 100 million extra million dollars got sloughed off the taxpayers' pockets and into the government's.
As I said in my budget message, there's the roots of your property tax revolt.
There it is.
Last year they went down to 20 million again sensibly, and the green is the property tax reduction program, meaning the net result drop is $83 million in collections.
The point that I'm trying to make is that the decision has been made, and let's stay the course.
We're in a transition period, and albeit there can be some difficulty, but we got into problems with the old state aid formula when we tinkered with it every year.
People, what I've learned in the government when people come for their budget discussions, they all start off now, I know you don't like the word unique so we're not unique, but we're special.
So nobody's unique, but everybody's special.
It's like I keep getting these economic reports.
One group writes me and says our industry's a $1.7 billion industry; another one writes me and gives me an analysis saying we are a $2.5 billion industry in South Dakota; another one says they're a 60 million-the Norwegian students write a letter to the editor in Rapid City, they're a $10 million-dollar-a-year industry.
I started totaling up all the industries and what they claim their impact is, and our economy is larger than Florida's and we don't even know it.
I'm going to give you a pop quiz.
You all have a pencil and paper in front of you.
I'm going to give you a quiz, the first one you don't have to write.
I want you to think five seconds about it because I'll give this quiz quickly.

My friends, it is the March 26-27, 1914, examination put out by the State Department of Education of South Dakota administered to every seventh grader in the State to see if they could go to the eighth grade.
Can we do it today?
If the answer's no, we've got a problem, if the answer was yes for them.
I don't know the answer to that, but that's the seventh grade exam from 1914 in South Dakota on whether or not you could go to the eighth grade.
I'm not taking the time to test us all, because none of us over the next forty days has time to repeat the seventh grade.
The Board of Regents, the Board of Regents.
We've gone through a tremendous exercise this year in terms of trying to decide, What should state government be doing?
To what extent should it be doing it, and those are policy decisions that involve the Legislature.
The third step, How should we be doing it; how should we be doing it?
And that's one that's really is an administrative responsibility, but I've asked the Regents to participate in that exercise.
With the hundreds of millions of dollars that they also spend including the tens and tens of millions from the general fund, all of us need to go through this exercise all the time.
I made a deal with the Regents privately after I came into office that I've never publicly talked about until today.
I told the Board of Regents that if they would go through the exercise of trying to make themselves more efficient, more productive, more effective, sorting out their priorities, that unlike the Executive Branch that's responsible to me, every dollar that they ever saved I would never recommend that the Legislature take from them.
I would fight with them and strongly recommend to the Legislature that they be allowed to reallocate that within their system to finding the most efficient, most effective, most proper mix on how to provide public higher education in South Dakota, and they needn't fear if they were to save five million that we'd try and take their five million away, which is generally a fear within government.
I made that deal with them last spring, and what I'm proposing is that with a major portion of the savings that they come up with-and I do believe over the next few weeks they will be making some announcements with respect to their involvement in this exercise-that they reallocate it, some of it, into creating some national and international sections of excellence.
No, we can't be all things to all people; and no, we can't be world-renowned at everything that we do, and we shouldn't be or shouldn't try and be.
But what we should strive for is good, basic, quality educational opportunity and experience for everybody who pays tuition or whose attendance we subsidize as taxpayers, or both, and, at the same time, they reallocate a portion of it within each of their six institutions-to centers of excellence.
So I'm calling on the Regents to come up with a 3 percent budget reallocation within the framework of their cost efficiencies, productivity examinations and analysis.
The state of our economic development-I think that this is a very important chart Of the 33 new companies that located in South Dakota last year, 18 of them or 55 percent went to towns of less than 5,000 people; more than half of the new companies located in small communities of less than 5,000 people.
Of the 382 manufacturers that expanded their operations, 38 percent of them, the blue, were located in towns that had less than 5,000 people.
Some interesting statistics for South Dakota- South Dakota had the second highest percentage increase in the nation in the percentage of people who are employed in manufacturing employment.
Our nonfarm wage and salary job growth was 2.7.
It's not very great, but it's almost twice as much as the national rate of nonfarm wage growth and salaries over the course of the last year.
Our increase in per capita income was the second highest in the nation in terms of percentage.
MasterCard International declared South Dakota to be the best place in the nation to establish a credit card processing operation.
Pierre was named as one of the ten best small towns in America.
South Dakota was selected in the national ranking to be the seventh most livable state in the nation.
Blue Chip Job Growth Index reported that our growth in the finance, insurance and real estate sector, was number one in the nation.
And Sioux Falls recently was named as one of the ten best places in American for entrepreneurial development.
We hear about how many workers do we have available, and the only reason I'm going to take a moment with this is it puts it into perspective.
A new manufacturer was looking at Mobridge.
In conjunction with the Mobridge Chamber of Commerce, a blind ad was put in the newspaper.
Nobody had any idea who the company was, and it basically laid out the parameters of the employment, if you would be interested, send it to box so and so.
Two hundred people responded.
In Gettysburg we did the same thing; 245 people responded.
Rapid City, which has 2 percent unemployment or less according to official statistics, when Green Tree Financial announced it was going to Rapid City, in the first ten days with an announced 450 new jobs, there were 2300 applicants that went through Job Service.
When Universal Packaging went to Mitchell-that has less by official statistics, less than 2 percent unemployment-they announced 130 jobs, and in two weeks they had 1750 people apply for work.
Yellow Freight in Sioux Falls, for 115 jobs had 800 applicants.
Rainbow Play Systems in Brookings announced 42 jobs and had 300 applicants.
And, up in Milbank Job Service took 1100 applications on a new prospect up there.
The point that I'm trying to make is we have a tremendous number of people in South Dakota underemployed.
We have no labor shortage.
We have no labor problem in terms of availability of bodies.
Workman's Comp.
No State of the State would be effective without it.
It's a perennial problem.
We've gone from best in the nation to just something that's truly hurting us in economic development.
I realize you can get on all sides of this philosophically, but I can flat tell you this-our Workman's Comp costs-every prospective person that's looking at coming to South Dakota adds it in as a cost of doing business in this state and puts that in their formula to see whether or not we are a cost competitive place.
That's all I'm going to say about it.
But for permanent total disability, per 1000 people under incurred losses, 6.3 percent of our people end up permanently total disabled.
Minnesota, which is the mother of all government programs, only has 4.3.
Nebraska has 1.4, Iowa has 2.
We did not have statistics for North Dakota and Wyoming, and Montana was 5.4.
The next chart deals with temporary total disability.
Again for the region, we're at 8.2, and actually, Iowa's higher than us at 9.7.
But, Nebraska 7.8, Minnesota's now down to 4.4, Montana's 4.2, and we didn't have statistics for the other two states.
"The work force that we have to develop; that's the new phrase the Governors have ""work force development,"" that's the new one sweeping around America."
It's like the word unilateral in the sixties and grass roots in the seventies and eighties.
But, we in South Dakota, must, and I emphasis the word must, give our people $15-an-hour skills if we want them to have $15- and $20-an-hour jobs.
We cannot give people skills, let them have skills worth $5 or $6 and then expect higher.
By the same token, we can't give them or expect them to have higher skills and expect them to take less.
They go in tandem with each other.
So we are going to create training programs that are focused on high quality, high demand occupations.
We're going to analyze and look at the whole post-secondary, especially in the technical field area, and the K-12 system and how we can make this a seamless system-which is the new phrase, seamless.
But we're going to create training programs that focus on the high quality, high demand occupations.
We're going to design and plan to attract high quality businesses that are offering good wages and benefits consistent with high quality, high demand occupations.
We're going to develop a system for disseminating the data and training.
It is very relevant when a student takes their own money, their parents' money or borrowed money-which is going to be their money-and pays tuition to go to school, takes time out of their life to go to school and get training.
What are they starting their job at?
How much money when they graduate?
And three years and five years down the road, what are they looking forward to in terms of job advancement and economic advancement.
Collecting and understanding that data in an honest, serious way is incredibly important to where we have to allocate our limited resources.
We have to build a seamless pathway from the classroom to the workplace, and, my friends, that starts in junior high.
Academically, it starts pre-school, but in the technical labor force of the future, it starts in junior high.
There's not a single occupation in South Dakota that is beneath anyone's dignity.
This old concept that everybody has to do this in education or has to do that is nonsense.
What we must do is prepare people for what it is they want to pursue in life.
Weathering the state of agriculture is my next chart.
Tyler's got the marking pencil.
I wanted to draw this in because I think it really puts it into perspective in a very pointed way.
This is Janklow's weather report of the last year, and I'm going to be accurate, unlike the others, because I'm giving you history.
We had a January blizzard that came through the central part of the state.
It's epicenter was about the Pierre area, and that's the one that took out thousands of electric lines, 2153.
At the same time, it extended this way, and we lost thousands of calves, and we have low birth weights and diseases and problems with a lot of the calves that weren't killed.
In addition to that, we got the rain storms that just pounded the daylights out of the Black Hills where we had to call out the National Guard to put bridges over some of the places so people could come and go.
Whole roads washed away.
State highways washed away.
We had flooding along the Missouri River that really concentrated in this area this year.
It was a huge problem.
As a matter of fact, inmates loaded 14,000 sand bags in 60 hours and had to carry them-because you couldn't get the trucks up to where they were at-a couple of hundred yards.
They did an incredible job, an absolutely incredible job of saving the facilities where they were stockpiling sand.
We had an October blizzard that went from the Britton-Sisseton area down through the Winner area.
A huge area through here.
That's the one that took out 8,700 electrical poles and all of the other damage that it did.
Last spring, it rained and it rained and it rained and it rained.
And this whole area of northeast South Dakota has 2.5 million acres under water now that it didn't have two years ago in addition to all the other flooding they've had.
They've still got 2.5 million acres under water.
The whole James River Valley area was a mess.
Now that's our weather for the last year.
Let me put up one other chart.
A lot of you have seen this.
I've had it in my office, but I'd like you all to take a chance to look at it and I'll leave it up for you to see.
This is an EROS satellite taken from the French satellite in May of '93, May 25, 1993.
Where you see black on this map, it is water in South Dakota.
This little water area down here is Big Bend Dam.
Ipswich, South Dakota, is right here on the map.
Huron happens to be right here on the map, and this is Lake Thompson, to put it in perspective as to what the map shows.
As you come forth afterwards or over the next couple of days and look at it, every place you see a black dot is water in 1993.
Now clouds destroyed it two years later when I asked them to take the picture, a part of it, but just hold that up next to it, Curt, if you would.
That's the same area of ground.
This past spring, May 15, 1995, here's the Big Bend Dam.
Here's Lake Thompson; here's Huron; there's Ipswich.
Try and figure out where the James River is, looking at that map.
Every place you see black, there's water in South Dakota, every place you see black.
And a tremendous quantity of the water we have now is ground water.
It's not surface water that's running off, it's ground water percolating up from the ground.
Lake Thompson, where I'll be having a meeting tomorrow, any of you are welcome to come to that, where Miner County and Lake County and the folks up around Kingsbury County and Lake Thompson are all ready to shoot each other over who gets to keep the water and whom should we dump it to.
And any of you that are in a conciliatory mood, stop in tomorrow.
You can sit in and help solve this problem.
Lake Thompson has gone from 25,000 acres, its now a 32,000 acre lake with no place to go, because the elevation of the ground goes up and the northeast lakes area, which unfortunately was covered in '95, portions of it, there's literally no place for that water to go.
Where else are we with agriculture?
Our ag prices are like a roller coaster.
What I'm giving you is the average value for the years in this chart: 1993, 1994, 1995.
This is the price of corn, yearly average; it doesn't show changes during a period of time.
It's the yearly average to date.
Here's wheat-one of the reasons corn is so high is there's a shortage of it in the world, but at the same time there's a big shortage of it in South Dakota, because we got a tremendous number of people that didn't get planted; and then with the late spring, with all the difficulty in getting planted, some of those that did got hit with the early frost that we had this year.
Here's our wheat.
There's cattle, and believe it or not, this is almost accurate.
Although it's year '93, '94 and '95, that's literally the way the line looks, terrible, terrible if you're in the feed business.
Here's what hogs have done.
The top of the chart represents $46.50; the bottom of the chart represents $40.
That tells you we have a tremendous problem with respect to the livestock industry and their economic impact in South Dakota.
And none of them are looking forward to increased profits or increased funding from what it is that they sell.
They're going to have to learn to live with what they've got or worse, they're going to have to dig into their reserves.
In terms of agriculture production in South Dakota, this tells us, really, how important this agriculture industry still is to our overall state economy.
We're second in the nation in sunflowers, we're second in flaxseed, we're second in rye, we're second in honey, we're second in oats, down to ninth in soybeans and ninth in hogs and pigs.
The point that I'm making here is that we still have a huge impact and always will on what agriculture means to South Dakota.
In value-added ag processing, one of the things that I think is very important is that all of us-everybody's always asking a politician about their vision-I think we really need to always strive to see the future where agriculture is profitable, it's productive, and it's sustainable.
The only way to continue that is move towards economically sound value-added ag processing.
During the past year, there was a groundbreaking in Volga for the first farmer-owned soybean processing plant in the history of America.
It'll have seventy people employed when it's done; it will have a two million dollar payroll.
And those are nice, but they're added attractions.
The real attraction of this facility is that it will process 50,000 bushels of soybeans a day.
I can tell you that I have ordered the Department of Agriculture and GOED to jointly fund a study to look at the construction of a plant for oil seed processing in South Dakota.
We're the second largest sunflower producer in the nation, but the sunflowers that we do grow here lead the nation in both their oil content and their quality.
There are two new state-of-the-art dairies going up near Elkton.
One will have 1,450 cows; the other will have approximately 700 cows.
Between them they are going to have about $7.5 million worth of construction.
The decision will be made in Moody County in just the next couple of days as to whether or not they are going to authorize a livestock feed facility that will start out with approximately 10,000 and can grow to 25,000 head of cattle that are being finished in that feed lot if it takes place.
I realize people are pro and con on all of these things- frankly, it would be easier if I was involved in agriculture for a living; I would be more credible, and it would be easier to publicly take a position.
But, let me tell you this.
How we can be against any of these kinds of things if they are environmentally sound, I do not understand.
Yes, we can talk about the way it used to be; and if the way it used to be was the way the world worked, the Incas would still be ruling their area and so would the Aztecs and the Spaniards and the Brits.
The world, whether we like it or not, is going to change; and it's going to change with us or without us, but it's going to change.
And one of the greatest restricting liabilities we've ever had in the history of South Dakota is that we sometimes refuse to want to change with the times.
And the history of the world is written with all of the empires and all of the economies and all of the cultures and all of the things that have disappeared, including the dinosaur, when they couldn't adapt and they wouldn't change and that's all I'm going say about it, because we all have a responsibility to look within as a people to make a decision as to whether or not we want to be part of the future or cling to the past until it's history.
In Roberts County there's a new operation up there that's got 2,400 high-tech genetic swine.
This facility will provide hogs with the new genetics that are necessary to basically make them leaner and meaner in the market place.
If all of agriculture could only do what the hog people have done in the last decade.
How they've been able to keep the flavor and squeeze the fat out of hogs the way they have and increase their usability in the market place is absolutely phenomenal, and we in South Dakota have a responsibility to be partners at their side in that venture.
That new facility in Roberts County will consume 2.6 million bushels of corn a year for their hog operation.
And we assisted in funding a new embryo transfer operation and semen collection operation in Chamberlain.
Are they big steps?
No, but are they important steps?
Yes.
The Big Sioux Tree Nursery this decision-frankly, unless the Legislature by law changes it, Janklow's going to make-but I can tell you, this is not an easy decision, but we can't continue to do business as usual notwithstanding the rhetoric of everybody who wants to seek political advantage.
In 1991 we started going in the hole.
I didn't know this when I got into office, I found out after I got here.
We started going in the hole in 1991.
By 1995, we were over three quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt.
Our trees cost us 45 cents to grow, and we're selling them for 30, because that's the marketplace.
And the issue isn't whether or not you like trees.
I can remember when I lived in Pierre as Attorney General, the State Highway Department went down to the old house where I lived, and they were going to put in a sidewalk.
They wanted to take my land along the curb to put in a sidewalk.
I told them no, because I had a tree on the corner.
They wanted to know how much I wanted, and I said, I will give you the land if you go around the tree.
I will give you my land all the way along the curb which is about fifty yards.
Well they didn't know that anybody could give them land.
Finally, we worked that out, and I could give them land.
So, I gave them the land, and I had a deal that the tree would stay and they built around it.
Well, the subsequent owner decided he didn't want the tree and cut it down anyhow-which is fine-but my point is, I've got a love affair with trees.
South Dakota's had a love affair with trees, and with all this water that we've had, we got a tremendous number of shelter belts that have drowned.
A lot of other ones that were built years ago have reached the end of their effective useful life.
We have to replant.
And when agriculture and the world really depend, ultimately, on just a couple inches of topsoil, trees are an incredible part of the effort to maintain and build topsoil.
But we can't do it losing that kind of money.
Let's really look at what the statistics are for just a minute, and I'm going to be very brief with this.
In 1994, Fiscal Year 1994, twelve conservation districts bought more than 90 percent of their trees from this tree nursery.
There you see them in blue on the top left.
Sixteen districts bought more than 90 percent of their trees in 1995, the ones that you see there in Fiscal Year 1995.
The ones you see in red in the upper right, what I call weak support, those twenty-seven districts bought less than 35 percent of their trees from our nursery.
Now I'm hearing from most of them how valuable the nursery is.
They gave us everything but the order.
And these twenty-seven districts, in FY '95, the bottom right, lower right, bought less than 35 percent of their trees from the nursery.
I've heard from the City of Watertown's government, Codington County's government, conservation districts; they all like trees.
I like trees.
I like conservation districts, and frankly I like Watertown.
But I'll tell you this.
My responsibility is to the taxpayers first, and I'm going to fulfill that responsibility over the next few weeks.
I can tell you that I did receive a letter with a proposal in it from, I believe it was Mr. Williams, from the conservation districts and he did a great thing to get involved in this discussion.
I received a lovely certificate from him a week ago that said, in my honor a hundred trees are being planted in Jackson County this spring.
Having looked at the election results out there last year, I think they'll probably get mowed down quickly but I can tell you that at least he says they're going to be planted out there.
The important thing is $700,000 worth of total orders for trees is all we're asking them to do statewide.
That isn't a $700,000 increase.
It's $700,000 worth of orders will save the tree nursery.
But, he has given me a proposal I think I've got a responsibility to look at very seriously, and I will over the course of the next couple weeks and, then I'm going to make a decision.
The state of our environment.
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources' operating efficiencies have prevented an increase in air quality emission fees for 1995.
That keeps us the third lowest in the nation.
They developed sampling water provisions for waivers, one of the first states in the nation to do this, for community and municipal drinking water systems that show a low or no potential for chemical contamination.
We've approved 1641 waivers that'll save $589,000 in monitoring costs that people now won't have to pay.
In terms of reporting time, on the average, DENR has cut in half the reporting time required for 1500 facilities to submit records for chemicals stored on their site.
And we simplified the permitting process for petroleum contamination, something with the old abandoned gas stations that's covered the length and breadth of South Dakota.
We've simplified the permit process for new construction requirements, and we're going to save $450,000 a year for these agricultural land farms that'll be used to burn off the contaminant spills.
We're the third lowest in the nation in the amount of toxins that are emitted into our environment by domestic industry.
And we've established a new set of rules where we're the first in the nation-under the law we all passed last year, HB 1085-we've got a new set of rules that use risk to human beings as the basis for establishing cleanup levels in petroleum contaminated soils.
We're the first in the nation in that regard.
Health care.
The 52 hospitals that are left in South Dakota are truly becoming more than hospitals.
They've become health care centers.
They're involved or getting involved in home health, they are involved or getting involved in hospice care, they're involved or getting involved in wellness care and in health education.
We in South Dakota had certified in the past year the first hospital in the nation under the EACH (Essential Access Community Hospital) Program, the Primary Rural Care Hospital Program under an Essential Access Community Hospital.
We were the first in the nation to receive that designation with one of our hospitals.
As I told you during the budget address, we're recommending the state get out of home health care.
When I was Governor before, I put the state in the business, because there wasn't anybody else doing it, and it was something that was necessary.
Today, we have over 50 private providers in the health care business, a truly developing, competitive environment.
There's no longer any reason for the state to stay in that business.
The Aberdeen Area Medical Foundation and the State Community Health Nurses Association are working together up in that whole area for a breast cancer screening control program to deal with getting low-income women the mammograms that they need.
The South Dakota Dental Association in the last year had 45 dentists who volunteered all their time to do the early childhood screening that's required under the federal Title V guidelines for kids, saving the state half the cost of that program, because these South Dakota dentists stepped up and did this for nothing as volunteers.
We have the first Telemedicine system in the nation that's outside of the academic setting, that's really being operated in the real world.
And, as I'll get to in a few minutes, between Sioux Valley Hospital, McKennan Hospital, Rapid City Regional-our three largest hospitals-they're really the pioneers in this area in South Dakota; and it's one of the few times they've been able to cooperate in moving forward without trying to eliminate each other on something that's beneficial to the state.
ReliaStar has recognized South Dakota in the past year as being the nation's most improved health system by moving from thirty-third in 1994 to twentieth in 1995.
Now I'm going to tell you an area where we're just got problems.
They seem simple; it's childhood immunizations.
We are not one of the leaders in the nation in immunization for kids.
The Indian Health programs that operate on the Indian reservations in South Dakota have a success rate of from 20 to 40 percent better than the rest of our counties in the state when it comes to administering immunizations to children.
Our success rate for children's immunization runs from 90 percent down to 40 percent in the various counties.
When we're talking about diphtheria, meningitis, rubella, mumps, measles, polio, tetanus, pertussis, these are serious diseases.
The reason we don't hear about them much anymore is vaccines have knocked the heck out of them, but they've not eliminated them like they have smallpox.
You can still get polio, and actually, in some places in America in the last year, we've had polio outbreaks.
This is inexcusable.
Absolutely inexcusable.
A child by the time they're two years old should have approximately 15 and very quickly 17 immunizations, but there are constantly changing schedules.
And health care providers in this state are prohibited by law-which we're going to ask you to change-they're prohibited by law from sharing immunization records in order for us to be able to track down.
So, over the course of the next couple months, I'm going to try and get a program going-I'm sure it'll be successful-we are going to go out to every service club in this state, every school in this state, every church in this state that has a Sunday school, every place there's a group that meets, and ask them on, a one-time basis for one year, let's go find every child in South Dakota that needs shots.
Let's get them their shots.
There will be no argument on those that claim they can't afford it.
We will pay for it with taxpayers' public funds.
The important thing is we get every child in this state immunized at the time they're supposed to be immunized, and at the same point, over the course of the next year, we will be developing a program, a computer program, with the passage of legislation we're asking you for, that will allow us to track kids from birth so we can use technology to our greatest advantage in terms of the new children that will be born in the future.
But for those where we have a problem now, we need the help of everybody and every group in South Dakota.
We're going to put together a program; we're going to ask everybody to get involved; we're going to find the kids; let's get them their shots; if they can't afford it, we'll pay for it.
How are we in Social Services?
The upper-left-hand chart, in red, are Title XIX eligibles.
We currently have 66,000 in South Dakota.
Why is this a program that's growing still at tremendous rates-and the impact on our state budget is huge, because, under federal law, every person that's determined by federal law to be SSI eligible automatically we must cover on our Medicaid programs.
A huge fiscal burden.
We have 66,000 people in South Dakota on Title XIX.
In food stamp households, we've gone from a little over 20,000 down to little better than 18,000.
We're seeing a continuous drop in food stamp households.
And, by the way, we're the number one state in the nation in terms of the accuracy with which we process the applications and handle it, and, in addition to that, last year we received a $600,000 bonus from the federal government.
Only in America will the federal government give you a bonus for administering a federal program with a low error rate.
So, we got $600,000, because our rate is so good in terms of how our state employees operate in administering this program in terms of the error rate.
We're in the process of finalizing an experimental program in conjunction with the State of North Dakota, an electronics benefits transfer program where this will go to EBT.
The requests for proposal are out, the contractor was selected here many months ago, and they are in the final stages of putting together a cooperative demonstration program that involves South Dakota, North Dakota, and electronic benefit transfers for food stamps.
The lower left-hand chart is ADC, the green.
And it's the drop, as you can see, the continuous drop that's taking place in our ADC households.
Of the approximate 6000 people that we have on ADC in South Dakota, about 2000 of those are people that aren't with their parents.
They're living with a grandparent, an aunt and uncle, an older brother or some other person that has been not selected by the state, but was selected by the extended family.
So really what we're talking about in terms of cases are about 4000 cases that involve what I'll call the traditional ADC mother or ADC father.
Our success rate last year, we were able to place over 1200 ADC recipients into jobs, by Job Service and Social Services working together.
We started a new pilot program in Rapid City where we brought the State Labor Department and Social Services together in the same offices administering the same programs, when it's done, so that when somebody comes in to apply for welfare, the first thing we talk to them about is, How can we get them a job?
At the same time, if they meet the criteria, we'll get them on welfare.
But how do we get them a job?
What it is that we have to do to give them the skills or the assistance to get them a job?
Child Support Enforcement.
We're in the top ten in the nation in terms of our success in reaching parents who have the fiscal wherewithal to support their children rather than having the taxpayers do it.
We collected over $30 million this past year, and we've targeted our budget.
We're going to try to reach $35 million over the course of next year.
The next program is one that's been in the news lately.
We decided to put our bark where our bite was when it comes to the war on drugs.
And I realize some of you don't like this, and to that I honestly say, tough.
Because if there's one place where we're drawing the line in the sand, it's that we're sick of drugs and excuses to be made whether somebody's part of the '60s generation or the '70s generation-and just because they grew up with it and it was OK and they dabbled in a little, now it's OK for their kids to dabble in it a little-wrong answer in South Dakota.
The last place you would ever expect to find drugs in your life are in the churches and the schools.
We now know that we have them in some of our schools.
We don't have to argue about it anymore outside of the educational community; they've known it for a long time and been frustrated with it.
We now know it because of the stories in the news and what the dogs have been able to find; we've got them in our schools.
We're going to get them out of the schools.
I know it sounds harsh, and I know there's a lot of people that object to it, but I've ordered the South Dakota Highway Patrol to put in handcuffs and drag out of the school anybody they find with illegal drugs in the school, period.
That's how they're going to be removed from the school.
I'm sick and tired, frankly, of making excuses for felonious criminal activity.
What we're doing, we didn't do at first.
We're telling them all first.
A word to the wise ought to be sufficient.
We're telling them all in advance, these young people, if you bring drugs to school and we catch you, we know how you're going to be removed from the school.
What the court system does with them and the prosecutorial officials do with them will be up to the prosecutorial officials and the court officials.
But I can flat tell you I know how they are going to be removed from the schools when we find drugs on them.
The bottom line is, if you don't want the hassle, don't bring drugs into the schools.
Those schools have got to be a place where kids can learn.
They don't need to be hassled by their classmates who are doing drugs.
They don't need to be hassled by classmates who are dealing drugs.
And, they don't need to be held back by students whose involvement with and who have been affected by drugs in such a way that it destroys or inhibits the learning environment for the other children.
We started out with four dogs; we then went to seven; we've got five more on order; we're going to have twelve dogs in the next couple months.
And next we're going after the truckers that bring drugs into South Dakota, and we're going to use them on every stop that we make on our highways.
We're going to ask for permission, we're going to follow the law in terms of search and seizure, but I hope people in South Dakota understand that under our law, the State Constitution, and the US Constitution, a sniffing dog in the right circumstances can give you probable cause to pursue criminal activity or get a search warrant.
The point that I'm trying to make is, I'm not looking forward to this fight, but we're going to get drugs away from our young people, and, frankly, I will do it with your help or without your help, but the taxpayers of South Dakota and the parents are supportive.
Juvenile Corrections.
It's a statistics game, but it's a serious one.
What you see in blue are 1990 numbers; what you see in red are 1994 numbers.
The first column you see are sex offenses committed by juveniles.
The second column that you see are aggravated assaults.
These are arrests.
These aren't accusations; these are arrests.
The third column that you see are robberies.
The fourth column that you see is weapons possession by juveniles.
Currently within our system today as I speak to you, we have 71 young people that have been sentenced by a member of the judicial system, by the Circuit Court, to Plankinton, or to Redfield, or to Custer-one of those facilities-where there is no room for them.
So, they are either still at home, or they are in a private group home of some sort, waiting for a bed to open up so they can have implemented what a Judge of the Circuit Court of this state has ordered to happen to them with respect to trying to straighten them out, with respect to the problems that they have.
We have 71 today that we don't have beds for within the system.
In terms of our juvenile beds and our capacities, and I'll be getting into this more in just a couple minutes, our current capacity is somewhere around a 190 beds.
Under the legislation that you folks passed for us last year and that you assisted us with -frankly in both political parties-HB 1339, we will increase our bed capacity when these facilities are built-and this is just for juveniles-to about 280.
Under the proposed legislation that we will be asking you to pass and accommodate in terms of appropriations during the course of this legislative session, it will take us up to the ability to have about 350-and I'll get to the exact number of beds for juveniles.
We have not increased the number of juvenile beds available in South Dakota since-1983 was the last time that we were able to increase the number of juvenile beds.
In terms of budget, because these things cost money, under the budget that we have submitted to you for your consideration and passage, we're recommending that in general funds our adult corrections go down $1.4 million.
We're also recommending that our juvenile corrections will increase by $4.5 million.
What we're going to try to do is move the programs to where the earlier problems are to, hopefully, start to eliminate-if it works, and we don't know if it's going to work, but if it works-eliminate an adult correction problem for people who are going to do life on the installment plan, starting out when they're juveniles.
Unfortunately, and sometimes fortunately, we trail the nation in trends.
The juvenile violence, the juvenile criminal trend is something where we've trailed the nation.
You can just look at the nation's statistics five, seven, eight years ahead of us to see where we're headed in terms of this whole problem in juvenile corrections, and it's a serious one.
We're asking the Legislature-let me tell you first of all where we're at in terms of facilities.
Currently under the juvenile justice system, we have a Youth Forestry Camp in Custer with 52 boys, we have a Lamont Center in Redfield for 24 girls, and we have 105 kids at the State Training School in Plankinton.
That includes 11 girls and 94 boys that are currently located-and this map is the current system as it stands today.
Under the legislation that was passed last year and the legislation we'll be asking you to pass and/or the action we'll be asking you to take this year, all of our juvenile facilities in the state will be located in two counties in two areas.
In terms of administration, in terms of schooling, in terms of how we handle it, we honestly believe this makes the greatest amount of sense.
I can tell you up front, I'm not insensitive nor do I not understand how communities feel whenever you talk about moving a facility from their community or making a dramatic change.
I've been through this before and I understand it.
It's an easy issue to demagogue, but there come times in life when you just have to make the right decisions.
We can't all mouth we're for the taxpayers and for the kids and then always maintain the status quo.
I'm not saying this is the only way to do it, but this is the way we believe will work the best for the kids and for the taxpayers of the state.
A Youth Forestry Camp with 52 boys, a Boot Camp of 48 boys, changing the Custer Developmental Center-which currently as you know is now used for developmental disabilities-into a home for 78 boys, and a Lamont Center for girls which will involve 60 girls.
That would give us in Custer County 238 beds for juveniles within the framework of that county.
At the same time, we now would have the 94 boys-which is the same number we currently have-and coming on stream, when it's built, will be the new prison that the Legislature authorized on our recommendation last year for 40 boys in Plankinton.
That will give us facilities for 134 boys in Plankinton.
Our facilities available now would go up to 372 that we would have available for housing juveniles who are involved in criminal activity.
Let me just, if I can for a second, talk about the Custer Developmental Facility.
I realize how emotional it is with some people.
When the Task Force was done with their work, there were 82 residents out there.
A couple weeks later, there were 81, because one gentleman passed away.
Of those 81 residents, 48 percent-let's just call it half, I'll stretch it 2 percent-one-half of those residents had one visitor from September of 1994 to September of 1995, and that's all.
And half of that half, 24 percent, never had a visitor in twelve months.
The other half of the patients out there had varying degrees of something over one.
Some of them had many.
Some families stayed very close.
It isn't just a matter of economics, and I honestly do not want the debate to turn into one of just economics-and we're talking about serious economics.
It costs us over $100,000 a year per patient in Custer, $250-some a day.
It'll be $80 a day, minimum, less in a community-based facility.
But when those institutions were built, we didn't have community based facilities in South Dakota.
We didn't have community services for the disabled, or Black Hills Co-op, or Advance in Brookings.
We didn't have those when those facilities were built.
When I was Governor before, there were over a thousand people in Custer and Redfield when I came to office.
When I left, there were about 450, because it was during-Dick Kneip started it and I really accelerated it, in terms of deinstitutionalizing people that were developmentally disabled.
And there were fights about it then, frankly, but not anything like it is now.
The community-based model is a good one with good loving care, quality care in South Dakota.
As I said when I talked to the parents that night when I explained this to them what I was going to recommend to the public and the Legislature, the 600 people who are no longer in state institutions, can you imagine what the hue and cry would be if I came to this Legislature today and proposed that we round all 600 of them back up from the community centers and we go put them back into Redfield and Custer.
That's where you would see a true war.
The point I'm trying to make is, we all recognize we can fight and argue over at what point should some people start taking care of themselves, and at what point do people fully become responsible for themselves, but we will never fight between us over the people who cannot take care of themselves.
We all have a moral, ethical and legal responsibility to care for these people the best, most cost-effective, most loving, caring way that we possibly can.
Having said that, we're going to recommend that, through legislative action, they concur that we close the CDC and that we turn it into a group home for boys, which is something that is sorely needed within the state.
We're going to ask for major changes in how prisoners are sentenced.
"We title this one ""Good-bye to 'Good Time. """
Changes have taken place over the course of the last year.
The Springfield Correctional Facility is no longer called a correctional facility.
It's called and it operates as a prison.
We no longer call our inmates clients; they're prisoners.
As I told you during the budget address, we don't have inmate shopping days and fun days anymore.
And we no longer pay inmates to play games.
And we put a second fence around Springfield.
We put the inmates to work in a serious way.
It's just the beginning of the program that we started this year.
We got 158,000 hours of work outside the grounds of the prison by the inmates over the course of this last calendar year.
But there's something really wrong with the system, because when an inmate gets sentenced to a prison sentence, and let's just say it's fifteen years, they know the day they walk into prison that all they've got to do is sit around and do nothing and behave themselves, and they automatically walk out of prison in nine years.
We can't keep them a minute longer than nine years on a fifteen-year sentence.
And of that nine years, they can be paroled in two years and three months on a nine-year sentence.
I'm not saying there's necessarily anything inherently wrong with that, but when a judge says fifteen years, nobody should walk out of a courtroom knowing that if they just don't make trouble they'll be walking out of there in nine years and six months without any supervision, not on parole, not on anything.
That isn't the way the system ought to work.
We've come up with a significant change that we're recommending to the Legislature.
It will not involve good time.
In the future, we're recommending that if a person were to be sentenced to fifteen years-and very candidly in this example, this person which we assume is an aggravated assault-and the way we're going to recommend to the Legislature, the more serious or potentially serious crime to human beings, the longer you'll have to serve under the matrix for a given number of years.
The less severe it is as a threat to human beings, the more accommodating it is in terms of time you serve.
This compares the existing system and the proposed system.
Under the existing system-a fifteen year sentence, you can flat walk out in nine years, and your eligible for parole-and, candidly, not many are paroled then-but if the parole board were to vote it, they'd walk out in two years and three months.
Under the new system, a fifteen year sentence-you'd have to serve seven years and six months before you'd be eligible to be released on parole, and I'll get to that in a minute.
But once released on parole, you would stay on parole until your fifteenth year.
Whatever the judge says for your sentence will be, under the new system, the amount of time you will spend with your life in the criminal justice system-in jail, in the prison, out of the prison, or in a combination.
What we're recommending is that every inmate, when they walk through the door after a short period of time of assessment, will be given an individualized plan.
That plan will involve what they have to do for work in the prison system, what they have to do for education in the prison system, what they have to do for counseling or receiving counseling in the system, and what is expected of them for good behavior.
There will be a predetermined program that will be laid out for them.
When they complete the program, their choice, they can then be released from prison on parole.
If they never complete their personal self-improvement program, they will never be released from prison until the last day of their sentence.
It's real simple what we're going to ask the Legislature to do.
An inmate, by the way they act and by the way they work on improving themselves, will make the decision how long they totally serve behind bars.
Inherent in that will be quality educational opportunity, quality counseling, serious work responsibilities, and serious educational and personal self-improvement.
Let's just look at a couple numbers.
Tulsa, Oklahoma; Syracuse, New York; Fresno, California; Austin, Texas; Richmond; and Honolulu, Hawaii.
What do they all have in common with South Dakota?
Everyone one of those cities has more people than the whole state.
We've got 58 cities in America that have more people than the whole State of South Dakota.
We have only 9.4 people per square mile.
Now, when I first saw that statistic and the staff gave it to me several weeks ago, I said so what, but then very quickly they explained to me what the impact is on how we deliver services to people who need it, as opposed to a New Jersey, which has a very concentrated environment of people.
Where we do Meals on Wheels, you really need the wheels.
And where some communities could do it in two or three programs, we may need a hundred programs, because we're so dispersed and we're so spread out.
And so it makes a huge, huge difference in terms of the statistics that we're dealing with.
It's in the 12s for the rest of America but almost 15 percent, 14.7 percent of the people in South Dakota are over sixty-five years of age.
That is an awesome statistic, my friends, in terms of potential expenses to taxpayers as people become, by reason of age, less and less able to take care of themselves.
But, fortunately, at sixty-five years of age, people today are a lot more able to do things than some were two, three generations ago at sixty-five years of age.
Our 230 public and private high schools, 53 percent of them or 122 have less than a hundred kids in the school system.
In 1964, we had 53,000 farms that averaged 800-plus acres.
Today, we're 20,000 farms less, and we're up about 500 acres to 1300 acres.
In 1980, South Dakota's census had the worst out-migration of people moving out of South Dakota in the region.
In 1990, we were better than four out of six; we had the third best in the region.
Of our 308 incorporated municipalities, 192, 62 percent of those, have less than 500 people.
Now these statistics are incredibly important.
As a matter of fact, one statistic that isn't out there that's really important is that we are increasing eighty year olds in our population at the rate of approximately 1200 a year in the State of South Dakota.
That's a very, very significant statistic when it comes to what the potential is for problems economically.
Changing times, changing values.
The Kids Count rankings for 1995 for South Dakota said we were thirteenth best in the nation for overall life for kids, but that South Dakota was losing ground with teen births, with juvenile crime arrests, and with teen violent deaths.
In those three areas, we've really been losing ground to the competitors.
From 1985 to 1992, South Dakota's teenage pregnancies increased 39 percent.
Juvenile violent crime increased 45 percent.
Teen violent death increased 34 percent.
Eighty-four percent of the working mothers in Sioux Falls have children under the age of sixteen, and 80 percent of those mothers have children under the age of six.
Half of our sixth graders in South Dakota and almost 60 percent of the junior and senior high school students spend two to more hours a day without adult supervision.
You know, as Marshall Damgaard said to me when he was talking one day, in the 1950s to the 1990s, the daily operating values of Americans has shifted dramatically.
A lot of us went from making sacrifices to instant gratification.
As Keith Paisley said to me last spring, Now instant gratification takes us too long.
We've gone from the pursuit of happiness to the pursuit of fun, from neighborhoods to individual lifestyles, from real heroes to disposable celebrities, from doing what's right to doing whatever we want to do, from striving for achievement to pandering for fame, from public service to personal comfort, and from personal responsibility to irresponsibility.
"To varying degrees, we are all guilty of some of that, but let's really put ourselves in the forefront in this state of saying, ""It will happen less here,"" and that we can still do something about those factors here better than they can anyplace else."
Teenage pregnancies, kids without adult supervision, juvenile crime rates, teen violent deaths, we can do something about that.
I say that fully recognizing that when you talk about kids and their parents, I know how difficult it is and what a challenge it is for a lot of single parents and a lot of two-parent families, because they're in the marketplace and working, of not being able to spend that time with their children, but we can do something about it without costly government programs, if we accept it as our responsibility to ourselves and the communities that we live in.
We're going to really move forward over the next year-and, frankly, this doesn't take any legislative action-I just want to tell you, they've had names from the Gold Program, to Putting Communities First Program, we'll call it the Strong Communities Program.
I don't even care if it has a name.
One of the things that we really need to do is to see that local people identify and meet their local needs are in the best position to do it.
"As Doneen Hollingsworth said to me, ""Bill, George said one day, You know, people are sitting out there and here comes Modernization this way, and another program going this way, and another one flying this way, and another one, and all these things are flying around like stars in the sky or airplanes on a radar traffic controller's screen, and the bottom line is, none of them fit together."
We're going to make them fit together with or without the federal block grants, but it starts with communities deciding for themselves what do they need besides money.
I can't always just sit down and write checks.
What do you need besides money?
Once they've identified, What is it that they want in their community for the elderly?
What is it that they want for school kids?
What is it they want for caring for kids whose parents are in the job market?
What is it that they want for economic development, because every community is different in terms of what they collectively want.
Then it's our job to step up to the plate and help them.
At the same time, State government has to target resources and provide support.
Our communities have to grow stronger in both the economic sense and the human sense.
Our relationships with nine Indian tribes.
Frankly, I've given a lot of thought about this given the relationship that I've had over the years, but I can tell you, in the history of this state, there's never been a governor who probably has a greater responsibility in this regard than I do.
I spent seven years of my life, after I got out of law school, living on the Rosebud Indian Reservation.
I went there for six months, until I could start graduate school the following January, and I left seven years later with some of the most rewarding, satisfying experiences of my life.
But it also put me in a position, because of the nature of what I did, to have a much greater appreciation and understanding than a lot of other people as to the unique cultural , the unique economic, the unique structural differences between the environment that takes place within the framework of a reservation and off the reservation.
For the portion of my life that I spent in South Dakota when I wasn't in school or working, I lived in Flandreau, where one of the nine tribes is located, again picking up different perspectives as how it pertains to the relationship of people and the relationship of governments.
And saying that, that I have a unique responsibility, I feel it's my job to try and implement and get things done that others may not have been able to get done.
When I commented about Indian Day, I meant exactly what I said.
It's not right that we ever pander to anyone because of their race.
It's more important that we deal with substance.
So what I've also talked about-and, frankly, I should have done it in a more articulate way, I didn't do a very good job of it and the net result was obvious-but it costs us over a million dollars for every day that we give the State employees a holiday.
Because the Highway Patrol, and the State Prisons in Sioux Falls and Springfield, and the Trustee Unit in Custer, and the Redfield Hospital, and Custer Hospital, all of the state institutions, the State Cement Plant, a lot of the programs on the colleges and universities, they go right on operating.
And, because of the nature of the laws that deal with overtime, and the nature of the laws that deal with make-up time, it costs us over a million dollars to give people a day off.
We would be better off to change that holiday to a day after Thanksgiving.
And if, as we learned when we were students in school-and I don't know.
They're re-writing history, so maybe it isn't true.
I still assume it is, but assuming there's no revisionist history on the subject matter, the Thanksgiving that brought about the first Thanksgiving, or a portion of it, can be aptly suited for the Friday after Thanksgiving in terms of that weekend.
But, in terms of substance, over the course of the next year, for those tribes that are interested-and all of them or none of them may or may not be interested-it's important that I sit down and we start working with them in areas other than how many slot machines are we going to allocate under a compact?
That's part of it, but it's a small part of it.
We've got to really sit down and recognize that when we fight with tribes or they fight with us, think about it.
It's always in only three areas, and that's all.
Criminal law.
Who gets to arrest; who gets to prosecute; who gets to incarcerate?
That's a fight.
And if you think about it, what could there be more senseless to fight about?
It's in all of our interests to make sure, every place off the reservation and on the reservations in South Dakota, people and their property are safe and that malefactors are investigated and apprehended and, where necessary, prosecuted and, where necessary, properly punished.
If there's ever been an area that's ripe for cooperation instead of strife, it's criminal law.
But the opposite works most of the time.
The second area is in taxation.
We argue and fight and sue each other over who has the right to extract money from people to run government.
That's what taxation is all about is running government, carrying on government programs.
And we get into disputes over taxation.
The third area where we get into dispute is in natural resources: game, fish, hunting, water.
Now, absent those three areas, I defy people to come up with a very long list of where the difficulties are.
We never fight over whose right it is to provide welfare benefits.
We never fight over whose right it is to make a decision that deals with environmental controls.
We never fight over any of those human resource things.
But over the course of the next year, I think it is incredibly important that any tribes that are interested in Bill Janklow and our administration to sit down and start talking about the substantive things-like making sure that every parent in South Dakota-if they live in or out of this state, on or off an Indian reservation-will be responsible to the extent they can for supporting their children.
The same thing is true with respect to how we care for the elderly.
I am well aware of the acute shortage of nursing home beds on the reservations.
As the tribal chairman and his council group that I met with told me, on Pine Ridge if you've got an elderly person that needs to go to a nursing home, they have to go to Martin or they have to go to Hot Springs or some other community, because they have no facility on the reservation.
It makes it terribly difficult separating elderly people from their community and making it difficult for loved ones to go visit them which is very important for people that live in nursing homes.
And working with the tribes to get the federal government to assume its rightful responsibility in this, between our congressional delegation and our offices and the tribal offices, maybe we can get things done.
Dealing with drunk drivers.
Who cares whether they are driving on the state highway on the reservation or off?
We want all drunk drivers off the road.
It's areas where we can work together.
Where you talk to abused and neglected and dependent children, it knows no colors, it knows no economic status.
This is clearly an area we can put forward serious non-rhetorical substantive programs to address the questions of how we deal with abused and neglected and dependent children every place within the State of South Dakota.
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-a 100 percent preventable problem, absolutely can't happen to a mother who doesn't drink during conception or during the course of her pregnancy.
No child should ever be doomed to a life that consists of living with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, if, between the tribes and the state, we can have comprehensive efforts every place amongst all our people to deal with this.
Dealing with economic development.
There's more to economic development than wanting jobs and wanting investments.
All of us have to put our communities into place, off and on the reservation-both, to such a way that a prospective company wants to make their investment there, wants to bank some of their future there.
It's an area where we can work all over South Dakota.
Tourism development.
Move it from rhetoric to substance.
But, again, all of us off the reservation and on, statewide, have to put it conducive to being a place where people want to come to visit, not just where we tell them to go visit.
Everything that I am saying applies as much to those of us that operate under a state government, county government, city government, municipal government, as it does a reservation government.
The whole area of Medicaid, I've been working very closely with our congressional delegation, Senator Daschle, Senator Pressler, and, frankly, Senator Dole have been very helpful.
I've dealt with all three of them at length on this subject.
If there is a federal block grant, we must make sure that in the Medicaid area they carve out special exceptions for ways they're going to deal with the reservation community, because to dump that onto the state would bankrupt the State of South Dakota in a very short period of time.
Because, now for everybody who carries a Title XIX card, including all the AFDC population, where they choose to go-those that happen to be Native Americans or Indians, where they choose to go to an Indian health facility-we at state government still get the bill.
We pay it, but the federal government reimburses us under the program at 100 cents on the dollar.
We needn't put up the match rate.
If, under the new program, we got a block grant that included that without 100 percent reimbursement, it would break us; and our congressional delegation, both of our senators, frankly, have been very, very helpful in moving this problem up to the forefront once they became aware of it on our behalf and are trying to deal with it.
The bottom line is, there is a lot of rhetoric that goes on with respect to the state's involvement with tribal relations.
The rhetoric from the state's standpoint will tone down.
There's been very little.
I fully expect it will be the same as it's continued to be from the tribal sphere.
But, the important thing is, what does Bill Janklow come back to you next year and report we have been able to accomplish by working together-and not talking about who was wrong fifty years ago, a hundred years ago, or yesterday, and not talking about whose responsibility it isn't, but how we decide between us how we're both going to share responsibilities to accomplish solutions to problems.
I'll emphasize again, when it comes to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, I could care less whether the mother is white, red, yellow, black, or some mixture.
We've all got a responsibility to do whatever we can to get programs in place and to work with people that have those kinds of problems or could before a child is born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and all that it entails.
The state of our future.
If you think back very briefly to history, How did South Dakota really start being formed?
Where was really the basis of our population centers of commerce?
It was the rivers, because it was the utilization of the rivers that brought about our transportation and our ability to come and go in the most successful manner.
Then it became the railroads once they were laid, and the clusters of our communities grew up around the railroads.
And then it became the highways and the four-lane highways and the good two-lane highways, and really the growth in communities grew up irrespective in the latter decades of railroads or rivers.
It was around the other transportation systems.
But, where is the real growth going to come in the future?
It's going to come using technology in the information age.
That's where the new jobs are going to come.
And we in South Dakota are in as unusual, lucky, whatever you want to call it circumstance as anybody in America could be.
Everyone of you on your desk when you came in here saw a little piece of wire, a little black piece of wire.
Do you see that piece of wire?
It's a fiber optic cable.
That wire will carry, under current technology, 18,000 separate telephone conversations.
This other wire, which came from under the street in front of the Capitol, is called a 3636 from the phone company.
That will carry 3,636 telephone conversations.
The wire you are holding on your table will carry six times as many conversations as this bundle of wires.
What does that mean for South Dakota?
let's just go to the next map for a second-because most of us don't even realize the gold mine we're sitting on.
This is the State's telecommunication network.
At the present time the State of South Dakota has this system under lease.
It includes the Regents' Information System, the RDT Network, the State Telecommunications Network and the I/S Data Network, the Information Services for state government's network.
That's what we currently have all in fiber optics, what I call backbone, for state government to operate.
But now let's go to the next chart.
The next chart is the buried cable like the ones on your desk in South Dakota.
Every place you see red lines we have buried fiber optic cable.
Between the private telephone companies, the co-op telephone companies, U. S. West, this is all the nongovernmental buried fiber optic in the state.
To put it in perspective for you, it's more than any state in the Union.
Neither California nor New York nor Texas nor Pennsylvania nor any of the others have more miles of buried cable than we do.
Their bundles may be bigger, their pipes may be bigger, but nobody has more miles going to more places than we do.
Phenomenal opportunity that that portrays, if you can move over those wires on your desks 18,000 telephone conversations.
Now we understand why last summer 30,000 telephone calls a day were being handled by up to 300 operators in the community of Winner handling the reservation systems for the Ramada Inns, the Super 8s and the Days Inns of America out of Winner as one of the two national centers.
What you see up here now are the microwave networks owned by the State of South Dakota.
In yellow, it's owned by Public Broadcasting.
Dark blue, it's South Dakota State Police Radio as of December of '94.
The green is the proposed State Radio Communications for this Fiscal Year that we're in that they're working on, and what you see in the bright reddish color is the future expansion anticipated by State Radio-that's microwave.
The next chart tells you what the State has, what the private sector has, and what the Attorney General has in terms of microwave.
That's our information highway, my friends.
No state in the Union can match that.
And where we've only got 9.4 people per square mile, and where its always been a hindrance for us to be hicks from the sticks, we are in fact going to be the modem cowboys.
Our cowboys can ride their horses and go in and get on their modems and be part of the front leading edge of technology that takes place in the world.
More importantly, let's understand what this means in revolutionizing access of educational knowledge to K-12 education in the state.
We should never again hear a discussion, Is a school too small, if it uses technology.
Look what we can do by opening up the resources of the State Library so kids can access any book.
And if it isn't the State Library, we'll hook them into national library bases.
A kid can do their research for their papers in any source where this technology is available.
Look at the impact that will have on the education of kids.
Look what it means when you tie governments and the private sector and hospitals and nursing homes and health care providers and educational institutions, all with the ability for instant communication and data access.
What does it mean in terms of the potential for the development of jobs?
We've got activity going on in South Dakota.
All we ever hear about is what's wrong and where we're last.
Let's talk about, for a minute, some of the good things.
These are some of the activities taking place.
I'll break them down here in just a second.
As a matter a fact I can do it off of that chart.
What you show here is the TIE Operation out in the Black Hills.
TIE, they've got an NTIA Grant and they've got 16 schools that are linked together around the state from Dupree to McIntosh to Watertown to Webster to Milbank to Dell Rapids to Platte, think of the diversity of those places.
All of them are tied in together on a high-tech bulletin board on which it can post everything from events to homework assignments.
And that's coming up into play.
And obviously, as it works, everybody can get at it very quickly.
At the same time, the City of Aberdeen is running that Dakota Interconnect that connects government and business and schools and individuals to the existing networks.
The Internet, the State's RDT network, Aberdeen's CityNet, the North Central Area Interconnect, all is taking place.
NCAI is a K-12 learning center.
Listen to these schools - Aberdeen, Bristol, Frederick, Groton, Hecla, Leola, Warner and Webster are all tying themselves together.
Where is the hub of this network?
Bath, that's where its located.
And the Dakota Interconnect allows Presentation College to be hooked in with the Cheyenne River Reservation where it has a center and on the Standing Rock Reservation where it has a center.
The Sanborn County operation, where they've got a interactive video network that's had its backbone funding provided by the REAs.
It's Mitchell and five small school districts - Alpena, Artesian-Letcher, Ethan, Mount Vernon, and Woonsocket.
Tied in also is the Queen of Peace Hospital, Dakota Wesleyan University, and the Mitchell Technical Institute.
I mean these are really exciting things that are starting to take place, but we need to accelerate them at a phenomenal basis.
Here's what taking place in rural Telemedicine.
South Dakota was acknowledged in the last couple months as the only state in the Union where Telemedicine has moved from the academic setting into the real world setting.
And for the first time in history, I think in modern history, you've got Sioux Valley Hospital and McKennan Hospital working together with Rapid City Regional Hospital.
All of them together came together with this demonstration program and grant, and where you see all of the other dots that's where their other hospitals are being tied together.
The same thing is taking place up in Aberdeen through the Presentation System through the hospital up there, St. Luke's.
What this all comes down to is there are exciting things that are taking place, most of which don't involve legislative solutions.
They involve all of us moving forward, changing all of the time.
Here's the state's RDTN setup, an incredible setup.
Where you see the big blue is where the uplink is.
That happens to be located at Mitchell, and I signed the executive order a couple of months ago transferring it to Mitchell Technical Institute.
I got us out of the business of it.
They're in the business, and now we do it for a fee.
They have the only course in America in a technical school that taught the kinds of skills to deal with this, and I figured it ought to be a real live laboratory for them, so they're running it.
And where you see all of the little mushroom looking things-they're suppose to be satellite antennas under our clip art here to show you-that's what's taking place with RDTN.
Every one of the orange ones is where we have video one-way and audio two-way.
Here's the terrestrial network.
This is video and audio two way.
You can hear both ways and you can see both ways.
Again, exciting things that are taking place in the state.
The last one is our telecommunications projects all tied together.
Now that tells you there's a powerful lot happening in South Dakota, but how much is left out?
Nobody should be left out.
Nobody.
Let me say this if I can for a moment.
We have really stopped the growth of government and the growth of taxes in a major way.
Now I can't tell you, and I won't, that there aren't times when you need more tax dollars; and South Dakotans have always supported-I did it myself when I was governor before, I did it last session when it came to broadening-they've also supported revenues that they felt were necessary for government functions that they felt would be responsibly and competently and properly run.
They always have.
At the state level and at the local level, that hasn't changed.
But the insatiable appetite where people who receive taxpayer money just constantly say give me more, give me more, and give you a thousand excuses why it won't work-Bonnie Gaikowski didn't give me any reasons why she couldn't look to the future.
unable to farm, unable to do what she'd always been able to do for decades.
Why?
Because she refused to take herself out of the equation on being an answer to the problems.
We've got to get to performance driven education instead of expenditure driven education.
There's a powerful lot of kids in this state that got a great education in an old school building.
And there's a powerful lot of them that get a great education in a new school building.
But it isn't any different than a family.
We've got an awful lot of good families in South Dakota that came from poor economic means, just as good as those that came from good economic means.
How much money you always have or how much you always spend is not dispositive in and of itself as to how something turns out.
We've got to quit giving rhetoric to and substantively get onto intergovernmental cooperation.
And, I submit, my friends this is never going to happen until governments no longer have money to expand on their own.
We can have all of the task forces and all the studies and all the discussions we ever want.
The truth of the matter is until people look down in the coffers and can't find any more money, they will not make the changes that have to be made.
They just won't.
Work force development cannot be a conversation; its got to be substance.
We have got to accelerate our ability to do economic development.
But it's like a man said to me, whose business is located in South Dakota-I met with a group of manufacturers from one of our communities after the election, a private off the record discussion.
The man said, Look, Janklow, you're complaining to me about wages.
Don't give me somebody worth $5 an hour, which is honorable, but don't give me someone worth $5 an hour and tell me to pay him $15.
You give me someone worth $15 an hour, and I'll gladly pay him that because I make a lot more money off a $15-an-hour employee than I do a $5-an-hour employee.
A value-added employee gives tremendous value added to my business.
So let's just figure out how we can take the existing programs and the existing dollars and turn them into what we really need once we've identified it.
Childhood immunization is a no brainer.
Let's just get it done.
Let's just go out and get it done as a people.
Juvenile justice will have some debate and controversy, but when you're done, ladies and gentlemen, please give us the tools we need to deal with the juveniles that have been ordered to be incarcerated.
Please give us those tools, and I'm sure you will.
Reforming good time is a sensible thing to do.
When a judge says ten years, it ought to be ten years, or let's take away the power of the judges to say ten years, if ten years doesn't mean ten years.
Let's quit doing a fraud on the public.
You know, we understand it; we're in the loop, you folks and us.
But the public never understands when you say ten years why somebody is out in two years.
They don't understand.
Let's just lay it all out on the table for them, so they understand.
South Dakota Community Strength Program, I don't care what we call it, let's just turn it into reality.
Telecommunications infrastructure, everyone of us has a -responsibility-the private sector, the school sector, the municipal sector, the county sector, and look where you're seeing successes take place like in Aberdeen-it is the schools, it is the hospitals, it is the municipal government, and its the surrounding governments.
Let's accelerate that in a sensible way with the right standards, the right protocols, and the right operations quickly.
State - tribal relationships, I've just set that as my personal responsibility to work together to get things done.
I'd love to come back and report substantive changes in how we deal with this.
Whether we like it or not, none of us broke a treaty.
Nobody lives on a reservation or off, it was all done a hundred years ago for better or worse.
We have to take the world as we find it.
We have to learn from history.
We don't want to repeat history, but let's take the world as we find it and make it a better place to live for everybody.
Value-added ag processing.
That's a no-brainer.
We've all got to continue to strive and accelerate our efforts in that direction.
Workers Compensation, I put it up, without recommendations for the Legislature, just because, if we want economic development, we have to have an environment where we have quality workers, a quality regulatory environment, a quality tax environment, and a quality cost of doing business, whatever it is.
Any worker, any worker, that's ever injured working on the job ought to be compensated and ought to be taken care of with their medical needs.
No argument.
But, we've got to find a system, maybe we never will, we have to strive for a system that will put us into a position where we can be competitive and provide better wages and better opportunity for our people.
Like I said when I started, when I started today, I don't have a million programs to present to you.
We're more interested in making do with what we have, with making it work.
We've worked very hard the last year.
I asked you all, don't make dramatic changes from last year.
Give us the chance to work for a year with the existing system.
Let us come back to you with a budget and a report.
Grade us on it.
And I'm not looking for a grade, I mean I did say that last year.
What we're looking at is to continue the partnership with you in taking South Dakota from here to there.
I'm not interested in predicting the future.
You and I have a responsibility to make the future for South Dakota, and there is a difference.
We cannot spend our time arguing about history, and we cannot spend our time predicting shortcomings in the future.
Yours and my responsibility for the next forty days is to make sure that we build a future for all of South Dakota.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
