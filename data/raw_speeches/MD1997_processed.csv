SENTENCES
"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Lt. Governor, Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Comptroller, Mr. Treasurer, Mr. Chief Judge, Mr. Secretary of State, Distinguished Members of the General Assembly, my Cabinet Secretaries, Local Officials, my wife, Frances Anne and my son, Raymond."
"and all Marylanders: Last Monday, like most Monday mornings for the past 12 years, I was at University Park Elementary School."
That is where Raymond attended school.
And that is where I volunteer in the library several times a month.
"stacking books, reading with children, and working with small groups of students."
"Besides having the pleasure of watching the professionals at University Park do a hard job well, I get to see the eager, earnest faces of Maryland's future and each time I am reminded of the real purpose of why you and I are here.for our children."
That is why we have been sent to Annapolis.
"Our job is to make Maryland the best place in the nation to work, to raise a child and to build a family."
That means making sure Maryland is a safe and healthy place; an economically secure and rewarding place; a State that conserves its natural resources and preserves its neighborhoods; and a State that educates and creates opportunities.
That means ensuring our State has stable sources of revenue and responsible financial management.
It means not being blinded by the bright lights of casinos or seduced by the quick fix of slot machines.
It means teaching our children -- just as my Dad taught me -- that education and hard work move you ahead in this world.
Only an irresponsible government would risk Maryland's future -- and our children's future -- on the spin of a roulette wheel.
"In other words -- and let me make this very clear: No casinos, no slots, no exceptions."
"Making Maryland the best place to work, to raise a child and to build a family means promoting the education and health of every Marylander."
It means serving as stewards of our State's growth.
"And it means providing families with the tools they need to raise healthy, safe children.We start at a good place."
"The ""state of our State"" is sound.It is good!"
Our efforts together have paid off.
We improved the business climate.
We streamlined the regulatory process and the State personnel system.And we reformed welfare.
We are far better off today than when I spoke to this Assembly just a year ago.
"As a State, we are clearly on the right track."
Our workforce is well educated.
Our average family income ranks 4th in the nation.Our economy is growing.
"There are 2.7 million jobs in this State, more jobs than ever before in the history of Maryland."
"And, unemployment is at a six year low."
"As we announced on Monday, since January 1995 when we started this term, almost 51,000 Marylanders moved off the welfare rolls -- a more than 22% decline."
"Thanks in part to the solid work of Comptroller Louis Goldstein and Treasurer Richard Dixon, we remain at the forefront of leadership in the nation with our Triple A bond rating."
"I am committed to keeping us there, and I know you are as well."
"As elected officials, we share the desire to do our part to make Maryland a stronger, better, more prosperous place to live and work."
"That is why I ask you to join me in our mission to make Maryland the best place to work, to raise a child and to build a family."
There are several ways we can work together to make this shared goal a reality.
A good job is key to building a family.
"That means we must pull together to make a prudent and responsible cut in our personal income tax rate so that we can attract more good paying, family supporting jobs to this State."
"Dan Roche, President of B. S. G. in Columbia, employs 300 people."
"He, and many other business owners throughout the State, have told me that a tax cut will help them further expand their companies."
Children must be healthy in order to learn and prosper.
"That is why I am asking for your help to implement our ""Thriving By Three"" program."
"This health care program will affect approximately 5,200 Maryland children and pregnant women of working families who cannot afford health insurance."
"When I announced this program, there was a woman there with two wonderful and beautiful children: Eddie and Harley."
"She told me that although her husband has a job, they have no health insurance."
Both of the children became sick on Thanksgiving day.
"Because they did not have health insurance, the parents had to take their children to the emergency room at a hospital."
They had to pay more than $150 for prescriptions.
And she relayed to me of her literally having to make the desperate choice of whether to put food on the table or buy medicine for a sick child.
That is what I want to prevent.
This $5.6 million program will save us money.
It provides basic medical care for children who otherwise will not have it -- for children who fall through the cracks.
"And, it will make a significant difference in peoples' lives."
I am telling you from the bottom of my heart that it would be wrong not to support it.
I also am asking you to double the tax on cigarettes as a means of discouraging young people from smoking.
Study after study shows the direct link between higher cigarette prices and lower tobacco use.
I want to prevent the teenagers of Maryland -- our children -- from ever taking up the deadly habit of smoking.
The tobacco industry will ask you to reduce the size of this increase or deny it altogether.
I urge you -- for the sake of our children -- to resist the pressure of the tobacco lobby.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend -- our outstanding Lieutenant Governor and my partner in governing this State -- has focused much of her energy on making Maryland a safer place for families to live and work.
"In the first nine months of last year, crime decreased by 2% overall in Maryland."
"We want to do better, and today we seek your support for budgetary initiatives to put 225 additional State Troopers on our streets."
I am proposing three additional Police Academy classes.
This will increase the Department's strength.
"Further, this will allow Superintendent Dave Mitchell to join local law enforcement officers to attack the problem of violent crime in ""hot spots"" around the State."
We also seek your support to raise the salaries of our Maryland State Troopers by 10%.
Their wages fall far below two-thirds of similar police agencies in States within our region.
These valiant men and women put their lives on the line for us every day.
They deserve to be adequately compensated for their dangerous work.
"After investing in their training and counting on their protection, we simply are being foolish if we lose them to jurisdictions that are willing to pay them more."
I urge you to support our efforts in this direction.
"Committing ourselves to making Maryland the best place in the nation to work, to raise a child and to build a family means we must focus on two key issues: First is improving the educational and job opportunities we offer our children, and second, protecting the environment they will one day inherit."
"President John F. Kennedy said: ""Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education."
"Think about what our schools will be if all children show up that first day -- and every day -- healthy, strong, ready to learn and excited about life."
"Think what our State will be if all children attend schools that challenge and inspire them, and instill high standards."
Think what our economy will be if every student graduates.
"and is ready to compete in the high-tech, information age of the 21st century."
and then keeps on learning for the rest of his or her life.
A quality education is the most important survival tool we can give our children as they journey into the coming century.
Education is the ticket to a good life and it is our responsibility to give our young people the best sendoff we can provide.
This means giving our teachers the technology they need to prepare our children for the jobs of the future.
This means wisely using the $138 million in school construction funds I included in my budget.
This means making certain our older schools are just as good as our newer schools.
This means ensuring all students have the same opportunities to learn regardless of where they live.
This means making sure that high school students who earn top grades can go to college.
And this means all students will get the training they need for a good job that will make it possible for them to support a family.
"We have teachers like Cathy Cerveny, who is with us today."
Cathy is Maryland's Teacher of the Year.
She teaches at Ring Factory Elementary in Bel Air.
And we have teachers like David Williams of Dunbarton Middle School.
David was recently selected as America's Top Foreign Language Teacher.
"We have thousands of teachers working long and hard every day for our children, their students."
"We must give our dedicated professionals like Cathy and David, and students like Josh and Hannah -- two students at Logan Elementary School who are with us today -- we must give them the training, the tools and the technology they need to be successful."
"But, unfortunately, schools across Maryland are not on an equal footing today."
"We have schools that, quite frankly, are failing."
"There are schools where 14 out of every 100 students (three times more than the State average) are headed for a life of low-paying jobs, welfare, no health care and, for some, a life of crime and a future in prison."
You and I cannot stand by and let this continue to happen.
It is our moral obligation to stop it from happening.
"It is our job to make sure that every child, from our most challenged to our most gifted, gets a good education in this State."
That is why you and I have worked so closely with School Superintendent Nancy Grasmick on education reform measures.
And that is why we have tried to improve the education of Baltimore City students without having your hands and mine tied by a court mandate.
Maryland's program of holding schools accountable for their performance has become a national model.
And I thank all the teachers of Maryland for their help in implementing this reform.
But improving education does not mean focusing solely on what is taught in kindergarten through the 12th grade.
"Nancy Grasmick and Higher Education Secretary, Pat Florestano, are looking at our entire system of education, from kindergarten through college."
"For too many families, college has simply become too expensive."
We have several great scholarship programs in Maryland.
"But nothing exists for the children of middle class families -- for children who work hard, who consistently make good grades, but, through no fault of their own, cannot meet the steep and increasing cost of tuition.We must help them."
Consider B. J. Davisson who is in the gallery today.
"In the 1970s, he received scholarships to Frostburg State University."
Today he is Associate Vice President at Hood College.
"B. J. has said that without those scholarships, he most likely would never have attended college."
Think about the kind of State Maryland would be if all the young men and women were given hope that they too could have a college education.
"And think about the kind of State Maryland would be if, when they graduate, these young people --with their creativity, new ideas, and fresh energy -- chose to live, work and raise their own families right here in Maryland."
It is up to us to open the doors of higher education to these deserving children.
"That is why we propose to establish a scholarship program clearly designed to help hard working, middle class parents who cannot otherwise afford to send their sons and daughters to college."
We must offer these young people hope.
That is why I call this the Maryland Hope Scholarship Program.
"Likewise, I will propose legislation that will establish a Pre-Paid Tuition Program."
This will encourage families of young children to begin saving now for their child's college education.
"This program, on which we have worked with Senator Ed Kasemeyer and many others in this room, will be of little direct cost to the State, but will be of great advantage to Maryland parents and their children."
Parents participating in the Pre-Paid Tuition Program will know their children will be guaranteed a college education.
Let us work together and commit ourselves over the next 12 weeks to make a quality education more affordable and accessible to every child in Maryland.
"Next, let us work together to meet one of the most pressing challenges of our time -- suburban sprawl."
"It is up to you and me to preserve for our children what is best about Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay, our agricultural heritage, our green fields and open spaces."
Our good intentions alone are not enough.
Good intentions will not save our existing neighborhoods.
Good intentions will not stop suburban sprawl that sacrifices our environment.
Good intentions will not keep farming a vital enterprise; and good intentions will not pay the tab for the infrastructure improvements needed to support sprawl.We must take action!
We must take action today to protect our cities and our rural areas for tomorrow.
That is what our Smart Growth / Neighborhood Conservation policy is all about.
"Consider this: For at least half a century, government policies have supported sprawl."
They have encouraged our citizens to leave already established neighborhoods and build in the countryside.
"And they have made it seem as though ""moving out is, somehow or other, moving up."
"But this trend, this inefficient and costly pattern of development, has hurt us in three ways."
"It has turned thousands of acres of fields where corn, soybeans and other crops once grew into housing developments."
"We not only have lost the productivity of the farms, but their rolling beauty as well."
"Likewise, far flung development has consumed thousands of acres of woodlands and wetlands."
These are our natural buffers against Man's many assaults on the air we breathe and the water we drink.
"If we continue at the current rate, over the next 25 years we will lose over 500,000 acres of forests and farmland.Think about it."
That is the size of Baltimore County and Baltimore City combined.
"Meanwhile, we are leaving and losing our downtowns -- not just downtown Baltimore -- but downtown Cumberland, downtown Cambridge and downtown Silver Spring."
"As residents and employers flee to the suburbs, they leave behind boarded up storefronts, the jobless poor, higher welfare caseloads, and increased crime."
"Together, these trends cost Marylanders hundreds of millions of dollars."
"As our constituents move farther and farther from city centers, we are forced to use the money in our budgets to build more roads, new sewer and water systems, to clean up failed septic systems, to construct new fire and police stations, and to provide the other infrastructure demanded by development."
"We do this even as we abandon the roads, sewer systems, and schools in our established neighborhoods.But we are changing."
"For example, we changed the way we spend money for school construction."
"Today we focus our funding on existing schools, renovating and expanding their capacity, or building at new sites only in areas designated by local governments for growth and development."
The new focus is cost effective.
It conserves human and natural resources.
It preserves and uses the existing infrastructure and tax base.
And it results in families wanting to stay in established neighborhoods and enjoy the modern amenities.
"Yes, we have started to reverse the trend of abandoning our established neighborhoods."
But it has taken us half a century to get to this point and we are not going to turn it around overnight -- or even in a year or two.But we have started.
"Ron Young, former Mayor of Frederick, is spearheading this effort."
He has worked tirelessly with Cabinet members like Jane Nishida and John Griffin to find solutions to this problem.
"Our proposal is not a ""no growth"" or even a ""slow growth"" proposal."
"It is a ""Smart Growth"" proposal."
It builds on the Growth Act passed by this Assembly in 1992.
Local jurisdictions have the authority for planning and zoning decisions -- as they should.
Our proposal builds on that tradition.
Counties still may direct growth where it makes the most sense for them.
"The State, however, will only fund projects in Smart Growth areas."
Our Smart Growth proposal allows our residential and commercial development to grow where it makes the most sense.
It is a system of incentives and disincentives to make established communities attractive and to discourage sprawl.It protects farmers.
"After all, farming is a business."
"Like any business, farmers must make money -- enough money for a family to eat, to pay their mortgage, to buy a car, and to send their children to school."
"Just ask Steele and Doris Phillips, and their son Jeff."
"This family raises more than 600 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat in Dorchester County."
"We must make sure that the Phillips family, and all the farmers in Maryland, can make a decent living off their crops and their land."
The Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation initiative also includes our working together to pass a Brownfields law.
"There are 3,200 acres of vacant and underutilized property surrounding the Port of Baltimore alone that are not being developed because of real or perceived environmental problems."
Brownfields legislation will put much of this land to good use without compromising environmental protection.
Our initiative also includes our Rural Legacy Program which will establish greenbelt areas throughout our State.
"This five-year, $163 million program alone will preserve about 90,000 acres of farms, forests and open spaces that might otherwise have been lost to bulldozers or chain saws."
"Over the next 15 years, this program would preserve more than 250,000 acres of Maryland's finest countryside for future generations."
"Additionally, I ask you to expand the Job Creation Tax Credit Program you passed last year."
That original law grants a tax credit to companies that create 60 or more new jobs.
We are asking you to lower this threshold so that mid-sized and smaller businesses -- the very heart and soul of our local communities -- will locate in existing neighborhoods.
"Our Job Creation Tax Credit will also extend to individuals with disabilities, where unemployment is over 60%."
That is simply unacceptable and we must change it.
"Over the past several months, we crafted a budget.line by line."
with one overall goal in mind: to fund programs that will help Maryland's families.
"And, like families sitting at their kitchen tables, looking at their budget, we have asked ourselves ""can we pay for this?""The answer is: we can."
This $15.5 billion budget is balanced.
"I make it clear here today, once and for all: Despite what you hear from the critics and cynics, if you look at the numbers in this budget, you will see a BALANCED budget.We did it last year.We will do it this year."
"The Constitution requires that we do it every year, and we will."
We worked with every agency and department in this State to cut costs and identify programs that are out of date or unproductive.
"The Early Retirement Incentive program, on which the legislature took such leadership, will save the State more than $30 million this year alone."
"Greater use of technology and administrative reorganizations enabled us to reduce the size of government, to make it more efficient and still meet the needs of our citizens."
"Medicaid and welfare reform, which again the Senate and the House took such leadership, provide substantial cost savings that enable us to allocate additional resources for health care, education, job development and child care."
"By doing all this and more, we could afford to earmark nearly $2.4 billion for public schools, more money for schools than ever before in the history of this State."
"This budget opens the doors of higher education for thousands of Maryland's students who, like me at their age, otherwise could not have gone to college."
"It provides pre-natal care for expectant women of working families so they will have healthy children, and health care for their children during their earliest, formative years."
"By raising the price of a pack of cigarettes, this budget goes a long way toward discouraging smoking among our young people and preventing the terrible diseases associated with tobacco use."
It offers incentives and an income tax cut so businesses will come and stay in this State so that we will have jobs for the children who graduate from our schools and colleges; so that there will be work for former welfare recipients.
"Likewise, it will rejuvenate our older urban areas where growth makes the most sense."
It puts 225 more State Troopers in our communities.
"It does more to fight crime, especially crimes committed by teenagers."
It protects our environment and the natural beauty of Maryland.
"And it does all this in a fiscally sound, responsible way."
"Working together, at the end of the next fiscal year, we will have $630 million in our reserve funds."
Think about this: $630 million in our reserve funds.
This is not counting any new revenues from our cigarette tax.
"This is a good, responsible budget based on good, responsible fiscal management."
All these initiatives represent only .36% -- or one-third of 1% -- of our overall $15.5 billion budget.Think about that for a moment.
one-third of 1% for the health of our children and pregnant women.
One-third of 1% to improve education and make it accessible to all of our children.
One-third of 1% to make our communities safer.Surely that is affordable.
"We must make Maryland the best place in this nation to work, to raise a child and to build a family.Together we can do that."
"by spending the taxpayers' money more wisely; by improving our economy and bringing jobs to the State; by making our schools second to none; by making a college education accessible and affordable to Maryland's deserving students; by making sure our youngest children are healthy; and by protecting our environment, especially the Chesapeake Bay.We can achieve these goals!"
"Today would have been the 68th birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was a man who dedicated himself to improving the lives of all children."
He was a man who gave the hope of a brighter future to all people throughout our nation.
"On this, the anniversary of his birth, let us dedicate this Session to doing the same for the families and children of Maryland."
Let us be the voice for those too small to have a voice.
Let us be the people who make their dreams reality.
Let us be the leaders who provide them a path to a bright future.
"Like many of you, I am proud to be a parent."
"And, like you, I am very, very proud to be a Marylander."
"When we adjourn 82 days from now, let's walk out of this historic State House proud that as Marylanders and as parents, we worked together for the families of this State."
Let us be proud that we took the high road.that we did the right thing.
"that we rose above partisanship and petty jealousies, and that we overcame our differences to make a common cause of our children's future."
"Let us leave here on April 7th proud that we did all that we could to make this State the best place to work, to raise a child and to build a family for every Marylander."
