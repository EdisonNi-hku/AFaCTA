SENTENCES
"Today, we gather to mark an event of historic proportions."
"No, it is not the presentation of the budget."
It's the birthday of Senator Clarence Bell.Happy Birthday Clarence!
Today marks another milestone -- your 40th budget address.
"Don't worry, I won't ask you later how this one ranks!"
"Two years ago, I stood before Pennsylvania and took an oath -- not just an oath of public office, but an oath to re-instill and reinvigorate all the pride and promise of Pennsylvania.It's been a busy two years."
"We said that the quality of our lives, our jobs and our communities depended on making Pennsylvania a leader among states and a competitor among nations."
"We knew there were challenges, but I am proud to report, we met them head-on."
"In 1995, we inherited a state losing jobs, losing businesses and losing its way in an increasingly competitive world."
The cost to create and preserve a job in this state was one of the highest in the country.
It was absolutely imperative to reverse that trend to make it easier to keep our jobs and easier to create new ones.
"By year's end, the cost of doing business in Pennsylvania will be nearly $3 billion less."
That's $3 billion back into the pockets of Pennsylvanians.
That includes nearly $2 billion in tax cuts.
"As a result, the makers of Crayola Crayons in Easton and Scranton's aerospace company, Northrop Grumman, have decided to stay and expand in Pennsylvania."
Now the future of their workforce is more certain.New jobs are on the way.Workers' comp?A cruel irony was at play.
"A system designed to help injured workers, was costing healthy workers their jobs."
"We dramatically overhauled the old system, with both groups of workers in mind."
"And now, our employers and our workers benefit from nearly $500 million in savings."
"Last year, I had to tell you about companies leaving Pennsylvania because of workers' comp."
"This year, I can tell you about companies that have decided to stay.There are many examples."
"The McLanahan Corporation near Altoona is not only staying in Pennsylvania, they're investing their workers' comp savings in higher pay and better benefits for their workers."
"Two years ago, we found a Department of Environmental Resources that treated citizens like the enemy.It no longer exists."
"Now, we have a Department of Environmental Protection that brings a common-sense approach to our stewardship of the environment."
We have eliminated thousands of pages of needless regulation.
We guarantee timely return on permits or your money back.
And we have established a novel industrial site reuse policy that is a model for the nation.
"In 18 months, 64 old, abandoned sites ­­ sites that once served as a reminder of jobs lost ­­ have been cleaned up and are ready now for new jobs."
Thonet in York; Johnson Bronze in New Castle; the former Hays Army Ammunition Plant in Pittsburgh.
There are 129 more sites being cleaned up -- as the list of opportunities grows everyday.
We gathered two years ago as a state with electricity costs that ran 15 percent higher than the national average.
"Today, we're the 4th state in the nation to introduce competition and allow consumers to choose their own electric company.Rates are already headed down."
"As a result, Keystone Powdered Metals in Bradford will expand in Pennsylvania and create new jobs."
"We have changed the way we take care of the people's money, too."
"In the decade before we came here, the budget grew -- on average -- 5.4 percent a year."
"In our budgets, we have restrained growth to an average of less than 2 percent."
One result: our Rainy Day Fund -- the state's savings account -- will reach a record quarter-billion dollars.
"Consider as well, that 2 years ago, our welfare system discouraged family, education and work.Now, it embraces those values."
"If you are able to work, you must."
"But, we protect the most vulnerable ­­ women with children, the elderly and the disabled."
"And we are making record investments in child care, job-training and drug and alcohol programs."
"Yet, PACE, the program that helps our neediest older citizens pay for prescription drugs, was leaving people behind."
We owe a great debt to Pennsylvania's older citizens.
So we enacted a significant expansion of PACE.
"Now, more older Pennsylvanians qualify for these critical benefits."
"Protecting the elderly, our children, and our communities -- is a duty I take very seriously."
"Two short years ago, violent juveniles were treated with kid gloves; victims' rights often were ignored; our children were not adequately protected; and death-penalty cases were gathering dust."
"Now we have laws on the books to ensure that young predators are held accountable; a rape law where ""no means no;"" a Megan's Law to protect our families from sexual predators; and a death sentence means a death warrant."
"Two years ago, the tools of state government were paper and pens."
"Today, we have a homepage --- www.state.pa. us."
We've brought our agencies on line with E-mail.
"And with our landmark Link to Learn initiative, our schools will be linked to our communities and our communities will be linked to the rest of the world."
Every one of these reforms has been about people.
"People who work, people who raise families and people who call Pennsylvania home.This budget is no different."
"Today, we take the next step to help our families and communities move forward."
One of Pennsylvania's greatest assets is our low personal income tax.
"At 2.8 percent, it is one of the lowest in the nation."
"But for some working families, even that low tax is a burden."
"These families are doing the right thing ­­ working hard, raising children ­­ but there just isn't enough money to make ends meet."
"Did you know there are nearly 80,000 families of four in Pennsylvania, making $18,000 a year or less?"
If you think OUR budget decisions are difficult -- imagine theirs.
This budget will give them help.
I propose a tax cut for working poor families.
It's the largest tax cut in this budget.
It's a $25 million reduction in the personal income tax for working families.
"A family of four making $18,000, will pay zero state income tax.They will save $500 a year."
Money I'm sure they can put to good use ­­ much better use than government can.Let's give it back.
I ask my Democratic friends to join us in passing this plan to help working families.
I know what it's like in a working family.
My dad worked two jobs his entire life.
And there were some days when I am sure even he felt two jobs weren't enough.
Many nights he would sit at the kitchen table figuring out ways to pay bills and save a few dollars.Not easily done for him.
Not easily done for a lot of Pennsylvanians.
"In fact, for many families, saving money is both an unfamiliar and out of reach goal."
"Without finding a way to save, they can only dream of going to school, starting a business or even buying a home."
This budget begins to teach them -- and provides the incentive if they're willing to try.
Family Savings Accounts give some of our poorest families an incentive to save with matching funds from the state -- up to $300 per year.
"Just as importantly, this will help to connect people with the best places to provide that, and other assistance, such places as churches and community development agencies."
Places that will not only hold their money but help them realize their dreams.
We'll also offer self-employment assistance to give the unemployed a chance to become self-employed.
These approaches are working in Pennsylvania.Ask Nancy Santana.
Nancy's dream was to own a cleaning business.
But a lot of people told her she couldn't do it.She was on welfare.
And some said it was better to stay on welfare than to try and climb her way out.
"But then, she heard about the Womens' Opportunity Resource Center in Philadelphia.I'll be there tomorrow."
This is a place where they see things differently.
"They help struggling women set up savings accounts, develop a business plan, budget for their families and obtain loan assistance."
"Now, Nancy is not only fully-employed, she is an employer."
And she believes that work is the key to self-sufficiency.
This budget further helps those committed to help themselves.
We add to our record investments in child care and job training.
Men and women on welfare will start their first day on the job knowing their children are cared for and their skills are sharp.
But government and welfare recipients can't do it alone.
"Today, I call on Pennsylvania's employers to meet the challenge of welfare reform and hire welfare recipients.Government will help."
There is a state tax credit for employers who hire welfare recipients.
We have streamlined the form -- now it's just one page.
And we are implementing a more realistic deadline to file it.
Many voices outside of government called for welfare reform.
These same voices must now work with us to make it happen.
"At the end of the day, welfare reform will not work without the cooperation of competitive and compassionate businesses and business leaders."
"If we are to move people to self-sufficiency, we all have to help."
I have always believed that Pennsylvanians want to help each other.
It's a spirit of community that is embodied in our very name -- a commonwealth.
It's found in our families and neighborhoods; churches and synagogues; our boys and girls clubs; our volunteers and civic groups.
"So today, we begin an important new conversation in Pennsylvania about people coming together."
It's about bringing our communities back together.
It's about government acknowledging that citizens and civic groups are much closer to the problems our communities face and are more likely to have the best solutions.
"And so, this budget invests in community-based, community-driven solutions to our most vexing challenges."
It's a budget that builds communities.
There isn't any community -- urban or rural -- that doesn't have a struggling neighborhood.
People live there -- but daily living isn't easy.
"There are no grocery stores, no laundromats, no pharmacies -- there are no jobs."
Store fronts like that can be the building blocks of community renewal.
Just think what a little capital can do.
"A day care center, a diner -- maybe even a barber shop or florist."
"Soon, an entire block is filled with small businesses that fill community needs."
They are owned and run by people who live there.
"And those people hire people who live there, too."
"And that builds a community -- house by house, block by block."
But it's difficult to get a loan in struggling neighborhoods.
Credit is scarce and resources are few.We'll change that.
I propose $15 million for a new community development banking system -- to pool public and private dollars and provide the most basic financial services in urban and rural neighborhoods.
"As communities grow, they also must be safe."
Many of the ideas and much of the energy to make them safe can be found in these neighborhoods.
Programs such as the First Lady's Community Partnership for Safe Children and Lt. Governor Schweiker's work with Weed and Seed -- confirm the high level of that energy and the success of such ideas.
"This budget offers support for those locally-driven solutions, with Community Crime Prevention Grants and with mentoring programs that provide our young people with positive role models to influence their lives.Mentors are role models."
Their gift is the gift of time.We all must give more time!
That's how children learn the difference between right and wrong.
The importance of education and the need to make the right choices.
The simple gift of time -- from a parent or mentor -- can make that difference.
"And so I say again, to all, we must give more time!"
There is no better reason than to prevent the tragedy of a child bearing a child.
This budget dedicates $2.4 million to teach teenagers that the best way to prevent pregnancy is not to have sex.
The rates of teenage pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births in Pennsylvania are too high.
"So too, are the human costs -- child poverty, educational failure, youth violence and gangs."
"Let's face it, a 15 year-old girl should be focused on how to succeed in math class -- not on her future life as a single mom."
No -- I don't like that term: single mother.It ignores absent fathers.
"But, we can try to prevent both by teaching abstinence."
What is exciting about these initiatives is that innovation and accountability are found in communities and in citizens.
"In many cases, the ideas and the energy are already there -- they just haven't had a government willing to work with them."
"We'll tap that energy again, in our pursuit of excellence in public education."
Let's put communities in charge.
Charter schools are public schools.
"Charter schools put parents, teachers and communities in charge.Charter schools empower them."
"If they want a longer school year, it's up to them.Uniforms?It's up to them.More math, less sports?It's up to them."
"Last year, we funded planning grants for charter schools and communities gobbled them up."
This budget continues to fund charter school planning grants to provide communities with the opportunity to create new public education choices.
"But, parents and community leaders can't start charter schools until we let them."
"This year, let's pass meaningful charter school legislation."
This budget also increases the dollars available to public schools by nearly $200 million.
"We have increased funding for special education, transportation, and vocational training."
We've added $100 million to the basic education subsidy.That's a 3% increase.
And the poorest districts will be guaranteed an increase of at least 4%.
But the proposal isn't just to spend more money.
We are going to spend it better.
Ten percent of the increase will be set aside for schools that demonstrate the most improvement.
It's a proposal to create a little healthy competition -- not school district against school district -- or school against school -- but a school and its students trying to improve upon their own past performance.
We will measure performance with improved statewide testing.
"And in the coming weeks, my administration will announce new academic standards."
"We will start in the primary grades, and we will start with reading and math."
We will insist upon standards that parents can tape to the refrigerator and talk about with their children.
"We expect the highest standards of our teachers, too."
Our commonwealth is blessed with thousands of teachers dedicated to our children.
I believe in the power and the importance of the job our teachers do.
"Because of that strong belief, I have called upon the Secretary of Education to raise the standards to become a teacher in Pennsylvania."
"Recently, a professional education journal noted that Pennsylvania has, on average, the fourth highest salaries in the nation -- yet our teaching report card read -- C+."
"Ironically, only a C+ is required to gain admission to our state's teaching programs.C+ is average.Nothing wrong with average."
But average isn't what we want from our teachers.
"At a time when we're raising the standards for our students and schools, we must raise them for our teachers too."
"In higher education, we've increased funding by nearly $20 million for our state-owned and state-related universities."
"And while we send money directly to higher education, we ought to make money for higher education available to our students too."
I couldn't have afforded college without a scholarship.
That's one reason why I am such a believer in Pennsylvania's Higher Education Assistance program.
"Just a few weeks ago, I was proud to award Temple student Jill Angelos her grant."
It included the three billionth dollar awarded by PHEAA.
"Like thousands of other students, she works hard for her grades and is proud of her education."
"In the first year of my administration, we granted PHEAA its largest increase ever."
"And last year, in a tight budget, we sustained that funding so that 146,000 students could continue to benefit from the program."
"Today, we propose to increase that funding again."
"This time, by 7%, so we can help nearly 2,000 more students like Jill have access to higher education."
"Our schools, colleges and universities provide our children and our future with a foundation in learning."
"But, as our economy becomes more and more dependent upon knowledge and innovation -- people will be employed not because of what they know, but because they know how to learn."
That's why this budget supports public libraries with an additional million dollars in funding.
Libraries are at the core of our communities' ability to pursue lifelong learning.
That's why we also make the next $40 million installment on our nationally recognized Link to Learn program.
"It's a three year, $120 million project to extend the information superhighway from school district to school district; town to town; and to link our children and our communities with the rest of the world."
Link to Learn starts in the schools because a child excited by computers today -- becomes an adult who will apply knowledge and skill in a job tomorrow.
"But, Link to Learn is more than just computers in classrooms."
It forges community partnerships.
"It links our schools with museums, libraries, hospitals and businesses."
It creates new alliances that identify the needs of our communities -- matches them with technology -- and helps them afford it.
Let me give you an example that you probably never even thought of.
"Agriculture, we know, is Pennsylvania's number one industry."
"And we know the future of agribusiness will be tied to technology, like precision farming."
"The Link to Learn connections will give farm families access to satellites that help determine the levels of nutrients, pesticides and fertilizers needed in their fields."
"Everyone wins -- the farmer, the environment and the community."
And Link to Learn technology made the connection.
It is a different world from the one our parents grew up in.
"At the turn of the century, Pennsylvania was an industrial titan -- a world leader-- that embraced technologies in steel, coal and rail."
"Today, innovation and technology are making it happen again."
Pennsylvania is home to one of the largest concentrations of biotech firms in the world.
"Internationally, we are recognized as a center for environmental technologies."
"And we are among the world's leaders in advanced materials, from powdered metals to electronics."
"Today, we embrace innovation -- just like our parents did."
"And in this new Pennsylvania, innovative people and ideas will be supported and encouraged by their state government."
"We are hard at work with hundreds of senior executives from our high­tech companies in a project called ""Technology 21."
It is designed to develop a technology policy for our state.We asked questions.We got answers.
"And with this budget, state government responds."
"First, a Research and Development Tax Credit."
"As whole new sectors of our economy emerge, this annual $10 million tax credit recognizes that if products are to be made here -- they need to be discovered here first."
"Again, I call for the elimination of the 1991 sales tax on computer services for several sectors of our economy."
This sales tax severely restricts our information technology sector and it discourages our advanced manufacturing firms from improving their operations.
Pennsylvania was one of the first states to place this onerous tax on innovation and improvement -- let's be one of the first states to eliminate it.
"Third -- because many high tech firms are small businesses -- this budget cuts the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax for all small businesses, including high tech start-ups."
The tax man shouldn't be so interested in taking his share before they have a chance to grow.
Government should let them get on their feet.
As the commonwealth finishes this blueprint to adopt a new approach to technology ­­ we also provide full funding for the new direction of our world­renowned Ben Franklin/IRC Partnership.
"Today, Pennsylvania competes head to head with Ohio, New Jersey and the Carolinas -- and with the rest of the country for that matter."
"This budget makes us even more competitive, improves upon the job-creating programs we have and spreads the good news about this new Pennsylvania."
"Through aggressive marketing, more out of state employers will know that the commonwealth is the best choice for their businesses and their workers."
"We've made another strong commitment to promote tourism, our second largest industry, like never before."
We're proud of Pennsylvania and we're going to tell it to the world.Part of that is exports.Exports create jobs.Exports keep people working.
"Through this budget, our commonwealth will have an active presence in more countries than ever before."
Our future success as a state is linked to our ability to sell products and create relationships abroad.
This budget highlights that priority.
"This budget reflects not just an interest in what government does, but an interest in how government does it."
"As one stands in this magnificent chamber, it's easy to reflect on Pennsylvania's wonderful history, her people and her public servants of her great past."
Just look at this mural behind me.
"There is William Penn, Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris."
"Our predecessors, commemorated on these walls, were the builders of this great state and nation."
And they served with honor and integrity.
"Through our personal conduct, our laws and practices, we too, must do our best to ensure that the people of Pennsylvania can look proudly upon us."
One of the best ways to do that is enhanced public disclosure.
"To that end, I propose $370,000 to computerize immediately the state Elections Bureau, so that the public can know who contributes to our campaigns."
"You may recall, I was the first statewide candidate to make campaign finance records available on computer disk."
"You may also recall I proposed to start this process last year, but it wasn't included in the final budget.Let's keep it in this year."
"The activities and expenditures of those who seek to influence public policy in this government, must also be disclosed."
There is nothing wrong with trying to persuade elected representatives.
There is something wrong with not disclosing those efforts.
I call upon the General Assembly to reform the Lobbying Registration Act.Send me a solid bill.I will sign it.
"Finally, the people have told us that they want their government to serve them -- but not to serve them alcohol."
Next month I will detail my proposal to privatize the state store system.
"In the meantime, let me say this: We will sell the state's liquor stores -- but we won't allow liquor to be sold on every corner."
The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board will be even stronger.
"It will dedicate its energies to better oversight, compliance, and education."
We will strengthen law enforcement's ability to crack down on drunk driving and underage drinking.
"And, will work with the Legislature to determine how we can best use the proceeds."
"To the members of the General Assembly, to all Pennsylvanians, if we are to achieve our goal, ""we cannot avoid meeting great issues."
"If we are to be a great people, we must strive, in good faith, to play a great part in the world."
That was the message Theodore Roosevelt gave us at the turn of his century -- and the same will be true for ours.
Pennsylvania is home to a great people.That will never change.
"With this budget, government nurtures their endeavors."
"And we assert with confidence and faith, Pennsylvania's great part in the world -- a leader, a competitor, a people -- proud of our communities, our families and ourselves.Thank you."
