SENTENCES
"President Kramer, Speaker Corbett, Lt. Governor Corning, Chief Justice McGiverin, Justices and Judges, State Officials, Senators and Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen."
Nineteen ninety-six was a year to remember in Iowa.
"Iowans young and old, in city and town, on farm and in factory, joined to salute our state's 150th birthday."
"As Chuck Offenburger might say -- ""What; a year!"""
Never before have so many Iowans in so many ways commemorated their heritage.
"In statewide festivals, community celebrations, and neighborhood get-togethers we gained a renewed appreciation of who we are and where we came from."
And always -- always -- we are left with the two essentials of Iowa: the land and the people.The land.
The richest and most productive on earth.
"The early Iowa immigrants, coming as they did from clay or rock filled soils of the East or Europe, stood in awe of the endless acres of lush loam."
They sank their roots into that good earth and it brought both good crops and good people.The people.
What is Iowa without its people?
"We are a state of immigrants, hardy pioneers who braved nature's cruelest elements to build homes and farms, and raise families."
"Those of us who have had to do chores on a bitter cold Iowa January day can only marvel at the toughness and resilience of our parents and grandparents who faced the sting of those northwest winter winds, and never turned back."
"These hardiest of souls, unfettered by excessive government restrictions, built communities, schools, and churches."
Education was always first with them so that their children could have a better life.
Anyone willing to work hard had a chance to do well.
Justice was based on personal responsibility and common sense.
"And life revolved around work, family, and faith."
"Hard work, education, personal responsibility, common sense, family, faith in God -- those are the gifts we have been given by our Iowa forebears."
Nineteen ninety-seven is a new beginning for Iowa.
"Filled with all the good granted to us by our ancestors and our creator, we face new challenges, new barriers to progress."
But we do so with our cupboards full and our state stronger than ever.
"Consider, for a moment: More people are working in Iowa today than ever before."
The incomes of our families are rising faster than those of other American families.
We remain a good place to live and raise a family.
"In 1996, we were rated as the ""Most; Livable State,"" the ""Healthiest; State,"" and the ""Best; State for Families and Marriage."
Landmark legislation last year makes Iowa the nation's leader in school technology.
Iowa land values are continuing to climb -- up 16% in just the last year.
We have the soundest state budget in the country -- with the biggest surplus of any state in the nation.
We have already turned the corner in Iowa.
From recovery to growth; from scraping by to building reserves; this state is poised for great things to come.Iowa is a work in progress.We can -- and must -- do more.
We must make this a better state.
Our growth rates are still too small; too many areas are not sharing in our economic gains; too many Iowans don't make enough to adequately support a family; too many of our students are not prepared to compete in a global economy; too many Iowans fear crime in their communities and neighborhoods; and Iowans pay too much to government in taxes.
I know there are those of you who think that I've probably been around too long -- that my first name is Governor.
But I'll tell you what; I'm not tired; I'm not complacent and I will pour every ounce of my energy into making this state a haven for growth and opportunity if you will help me.
We have a plan to do just that.
And the first step is to make Iowa the most competitive state in America.
"In the past couple of years, we have taken targeted actions designed to improve our overall competitiveness."
"The elimination of the property tax on machinery and equipment, improvement of our farmer-owned cooperative law, and expansion of the New Jobs and Income Program were all designed to attract capital-intensive industries and create quality jobs, increase incomes, and bring population growth to all parts of the state."
I am pleased to report to you that those actions have paid off -- in a big way.
"In the last year alone, over one billion dollars of capital investment has been made in Iowa because of these changes."
What we have learned is that taking bold steps to improve our competitiveness works.
"Being competitive means having a reputation around the world as a good place to start a business, locate a plant, raise your children, and retire."
"It means not penalizing growth, but rewarding it."
But being competitive requires more than bold words -- it demands bold deeds.
"The Governor's Task Force on Economic Competitiveness, which completed its work in December, found that our personal income tax is the most significant barrier to bringing new business and good paying jobs to Iowa."
"If we are to grow, we must attract high paying jobs."
"Yet the Task Force found that Iowa's high personal income tax has ""a; negative impact on employee recruitment and retention ."
particularly for technical and middle and upper management positions.Those are the jobs we want!We've got to change.
There is no question our personal income tax rates are too high.
They stymie economic growth and impair the unbounding determination of Iowans to build a better life for ourselves and our descendants.
Just look how we compare to other states.
"Unfortunately, we are among the top ten states in personal income tax rates."
And many of the states which share that unenviable position with us have lowered rates in the last two years.
"New York, Oregon, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut, and even so-called Taxachusetts have lowered income tax rates."
"A Cato Institute study found that between 1990 and 1995, those states that cut taxes the most experienced employment growth of over 10 percent; population growth of more than 7 percent; and income growth of almost 33 percent."
States that cut taxes performed much better than those that did not.
"Although Iowa's economy is growing, I know -- and you know -- that we can do even better.The time is right."
We can cut taxes because we are in a position of financial strength.
We need to cut taxes to make the state more competitive.
We must cut taxes to unleash the ingenuity of Iowans to carry this state to a future of unparalleled growth and progress.
"And so today, I recommend we reduce personal income tax rates across-the-board by 15 percent over the next two years."
This will keep millions of hard-earned dollars in the pockets of hard-working Iowans.
The plan I am putting forth will unquestionably improve our competitiveness.
It is fair and will benefit all Iowans by reducing their taxes while maintaining the current progressivity of our tax system.
"And most of all, it is realistic and sustainable for the long term."
We have taken into account commitments already made to education and infrastructure.
Another commitment we have made is to property tax relief.
"This year alone, the state will be adding another $17 million of property tax relief for mental health -- increasing our annual commitment to $95 million."
The Competitiveness Task Force also identified residential property taxes as an impediment to growth.
Iowa homeowners pay too much in property taxes.
I am recommending an additional $20 million in property tax relief directly delivered to homeowners by increasing the homestead tax credit.
Property taxes have long been a burden on our family farmers.
"To preserve and strengthen our family farms, we need to eliminate property taxes on agricultural buildings which are located on the family farm homestead."
"This is a bold move designed to give a competitive advantage to the family farmer, who embodies the true character and strength of our state."
"In addition to property taxes, there is another tax which is unfair to farmers as well as small business owners, homeowners, and retirees."
Our state inheritance tax punishes a family when they lose a loved one.
Too many Iowa families have been forced to go into debt or sell their possessions to pay death taxes.
"Not only is that unfair, but it is contrary to our Iowa values."
We should eliminate the inheritance tax for family members without delay.
"To protect the safety of Iowa workers and improve our competitiveness, we must strengthen our workplace drug-testing law."
We have the weakest law in the Midwest.
"From factory floor to construction site, Iowa workers are needlessly placed at risk."
"Employees and passengers in the trucking, railroad, and airline industries have had this protection for many years, and Iowa workers deserve the same."
Cutting income and property taxes; eliminating the inheritance tax for family members; strengthening our workplace drug-testing law.
"These are critical elements of our plan to make Iowa a global competitor for safe, quality jobs."
They require bold action this year.
The quality of our schools has always been one of our best qualities.
"From the one-room schoolhouse of the 1800's to the unlimited learning possibilities of the Internet, Iowans have always put education first."
"Just last year, we made a $150 million commitment to school improvement and technology."
"Several years ago, we had the foresight to envision what the Information Age could do for education, so we created the Iowa Communications Network."
"With all that we have done, some may think we've done it all."
"In today's rapidly changing world, I, for one, am not satisfied."
Iowa must never stop improving education.
Our challenge is to design schools that will keep Iowa at the forefront of educational excellence for the 21st century.
We need to benchmark how our schools measure up to the highest levels of academic achievement in the world.
"To accomplish that, I will appoint a Commission on Educational Excellence for the 21st Century."
This bipartisan group of citizens will assist us in developing a vision for strengthening Iowa's leadership in education.
"From the very beginning, Iowa's enlightened leaders had a vision to lead America in literacy by giving every Iowan access to quality education."
They also recognized the importance of local control and parental involvement.
"Building on that tradition, I am directing the Department of Education to undertake the IowA+ Community High Schools program to encourage innovation and creativity and to expand community involvement in efforts to improve local schools."
Our schools are strong because of the outstanding people who have chosen to make educating our children their life's pursuit.
"A decade ago, we began our efforts to increase teachers' salaries in order to attract the best and brightest."
"In 1997, we should increase the minimum starting salaries for Iowa teachers by 10 percent."
"Along with our quality public schools, our state is blessed with outstanding nonpublic schools."
Thousands of Iowa parents make a financial sacrifice to send their children to the school of their choice.
"This year, I am recommending we double the tuition tax credit to make nonpublic schools a more affordable option for Iowa families."
Iowa has three world-renowned state universities and 15 outstanding area community colleges.
The budget I am presenting includes $5 million a year for technology investments at our Regents institutions and community colleges.
I am also recommending an 8 percent increase in the Iowa Tuition Grant for needy Iowa students attending our premier independent colleges and universities.
We should also fund the National Guard Tuition Assistance Program to put higher education within reach of more Iowans and to help in recruitment for our outstanding Iowa National Guard.
Iowa is a leader in distance learning.
No state in America has the resource that we have with the Iowa Communications Network.
We are adding well over a hundred classrooms each year and every school district will be connected by 1999.
"Advanced mathematics, the latest scientific research, foreign languages, and a seemingly endless flow of information will be available to Iowa students in every school district."
Distance education must now be extended to all Iowa citizens.
"For our workers and professionals to be competitive in the ever-changing world economy, we must make all of the opportunities of our state's higher education institutions available to all of our people, no matter where they live."
The ACCESS Education Through Distance Learning initiative will help us chart a course for broadening the horizons of all Iowans.
"Our independent colleges and universities, state universities, and community colleges all have an important role to play."
Just imagine what an asset it will be when every Iowan has access to the courses and training that are today only available on college campuses.
ACCESS Education will be a passport to knowledge and pathway to the future for Iowans rural and urban alike.
"Just as technology is widening educational possibilities for Iowans, it is transforming the face of business, government, and homes all across America."
"When I became governor, state government was run with typewriters, carbon paper, and stacks and stacks of file folders."
"Today, we use video-conferencing, e-mail, and a homepage on the Internet."
"This year, I believe we must embark on a mission to ensure that every Iowa community has access to high-speed, low-cost Internet service."
"Currently, about 30 percent of our communities lack adequate access to the Internet and quite frankly, universal access is a necessity if Iowa is to be a global competitor in years to come."
State government must become more technology driven.
"The author of our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, said, ""Information; is the currency of democracy."
"In the 21st Century, Iowans need and deserve a government that is easily accessible from their home or business."
The goal that I have set forth is for state government to have the capability by the year 2000 to complete any electronic transaction from remote locations throughout the state.
That means Iowans will not have to travel to conduct business with the state.
Transactions will be easier and quicker for citizens and state employees alike.
Using technology more effectively will make government more efficient and save millions of tax dollars.
"To achieve our technology goals, I am recommending the creation of a Department of Technology and adequate technology infrastructure funding to re-engineer state government to make information and services more accessible to all Iowans."
The marvels and wonders of technology are undeniably changing the world.
At no time in our history has it been so critical for us to be on the cutting edge.
"Let us bring the State of Iowa fully into the Information Age and enable future generations of our people to better themselves, their communities, and our system of government by harnessing information -- Jefferson's currency of democracy."
"As we look at how we deliver services, we must ensure taxpayers that state government is just as efficient as private business."
"Where appropriate, areas of state government should be competitively bid."
State employees will be provided assistance in bidding for the work along with private sector contractors.
"State employees will be empowered to rethink the way we do things, working to improve efficiencies."
"In our first experiment -- the Department of Transportation's highway paint striping -- the state employees won the bid and will save the state over $300,000 a year."
That is a tribute to state employees' ingenuity as well as the power of the free market.
"In Iowa, we are constitutionally required to balance our budget every year."
"If we are to return our nation to a position of fiscal integrity, a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution should be passed this year."
This Legislature should adopt a resolution calling on Congress to pass the balanced budget amendment.
"And when it passes, we should be one of the first states to ratify."
One of the foremost responsibilities of government is to protect the safety of its citizens.
We are fortunate to live in a place where the crime rate is well below the national average.
"But make no mistake, crime is a problem here in Iowa."
"Every time we read or hear about violent crime, we should be outraged."
"When an innocent Iowan is struck down, stolen from, or has their life disrupted by crime, we are all victims."
Seated in the gallery today are many Iowans affected by crime.
Two families among them played a key role in the program I am submitting this year.
The Hallengrens of Adel lost their daughter and a good friend to a drunk driver last April and approached me with many of the components of the bold anti-drunk driving program I am offering.
The Sturdys of Fontanelle had a daughter murdered in a domestic violence situation many years ago and fought for over a decade to get restitution from the murderer.
My automatic restitution proposal is a result of their efforts.
These families and others have had the courage to stand up and speak out about a system which puts the rights of criminals ahead of the rights of victims.
"Today, I salute all victims who have the strength to stand up, speak out, and work for change."
"We Iowans, known for our compassion and common sense, and being driven by disdain for violence, must act boldly."
We must stand up for the rights of victims of crime.
We must stand up to the criminals.
Those who break our laws will pay for their actions.
The victims of crime will no longer be the forgotten ones in our criminal justice system.
A thirty year era of permissiveness must end.
I am recommending we adopt a Crime Victims' Bill of Rights to our state constitution.
Twenty-nine other states already provide this kind of constitutional protection for victims and it's time Iowa does as well.
"We are adding 2,250 beds to our state prison system and now it's time to put the prisoners to work."
"Making prisoners work can increase their skills, reduce the recidivism rate, and make it possible for them to pay restitution to their victims and at least part of the cost of their imprisonment."
A vast majority of Iowans join me today in asking you to restore the death penalty.
We need it to protect the innocent victims of rape and kidnapping from being murdered.
It should also be available as a weapon to be used against the most violent prisoners who kill correctional officers or others.
"If we are to be successful at reducing crime, one issue in particular must be addressed: juvenile crime."
One of the great mistakes that has been made in public policy over the last 30 years is that a shroud of secrecy has been created to protect juveniles from the consequences of their actions.
We should allow full public access to information on juvenile crime and let them face the public scrutiny their actions deserve.
I am recommending we establish penalties for underage gambling and increase the penalties for underage drinking.
The budget I am presenting also includes a 20 percent increase in funding for the successful and innovative treatment efforts already underway in Iowa communities.
"Several weeks ago, I visited Lucas Elementary School, just east of the Capitol in one of Des Moines' inner city neighborhoods, to announce an ambitious prevention effort we will be undertaking this year."
Iowa is blessed with thousands of retirees who regularly volunteer in their communities.
"There is no better way to help at-risk children than to provide for them caring, committed adult mentors who will encourage them to stay in school and succeed."
I envision a day when every at-risk child in Iowa has a senior volunteer mentor.
We can truly reduce juvenile crime by helping at-risk kids at an early age.
The best prevention efforts we can have are ones that channel the kindness and caring of older Iowans toward the children who need it the most.
"Today, I call on older Iowans to take part in making life better for children by getting involved in Iowa schools."
The strength of our state depends on the strength of our families.
"Last year, Lt. Governor Corning and I undertook a Campaign for the Family which has helped put more focus on the needs of Iowa families and has involved hundreds of people through community family forums all over the state."
Our goal is to make Iowa the most family-friendly state in America.
"In 1997, we will continue the Campaign for the Family and hold a Statewide Family Summit to involve Iowans even more in strengthening our families and children."
"My program for this year includes several initiatives designed to help families be safe, stable, self-sufficient, and healthy."
"We need to implement a system of Learnfare to assure that the children of those on welfare are getting an education, which is their most valuable key to self-sufficiency."
I am also recommending steps to enhance family foster care as well as services to the frail elderly and Alzheimer's patients.
"And we should also increase preschool opportunities for at-risk children, expand child care assistance, strengthen our parental notification law, and prevent teens from using tobacco."
"Reducing the tax burden for Iowa families; improving our schools; making state government more technology-driven; protecting our citizens; and, strengthening families -- these are the challenges we face as we forge a new era in Iowa history."
We have been given so much by those who came before us.
We are grounded in the good earth with strong values and faith in God.
Our challenge is to employ these values to build a better Iowa -- to take bold steps to achieve breakthrough results.
"Today, I stand before you, the people of Iowa, more excited about our prospects than at any time in my past service to you."
"As we stand at the precipice of the 21st century, our place in history is not unlike that of the first settlers to this state."
Before us is spread endless vistas of opportunity.
It is for us to take that vista and make it our own.
"We have the land, we have the people.We have the resources."
"It is for those in this room today to provide the bold leadership, the vision to make that future ours."
"As I look around this chamber, I see new faces and old friends."
I know you share my enthusiasm for this state.
Let us harness that shared energy to make 1997 a year future Iowans will not forget.
"Let us not shrink from the daunting task before us, but rise to usher in a new era of growth and opportunity for our state.Let us begin today.Thank you and God bless you."
