SENTENCES
"It's a pleasure to be with you today, and a privilege to come before you one last time to deliver the annual State of the State."
"I have had the opportunity to serve in this office during a period of unprecedented prosperity and, now, during a time of deep economic dislocation."
To have been afforded the opportunity to serve at all has been a great honor and one for which I humbly thank you.
I can tell you that it is much easier to govern during good times than during bad times.
"But I can also tell you that it is the difficult times that provide the true test of our metal, of our character and of our values."
And these are difficult times for Oregon the most difficult in the past 20 years.
"In fact, there are only five members of the current Legislature who served during the 1981-83 biennium when we struggled through our last recession."
"Today's recession, although not as deep as the one two decades ago, is more serious because it has uncovered the fundamental flaw in a series of policy choices we made during the 1990s."
And that is what I want to talk to you about today.
"As you know, in the six years leading up to 2001, Oregon experienced record employment and economic growth."
"It was a good time to be governor -- a time of optimism, vision and action."
"We began to implement the Education Act for the 21st Century, establishing high, outcome-based academic standards for our children."
"We expanded our community college system, created three new universities and changed the financing model for higher education."
"Facing a growing conflict between the extraction of natural resources and long term environmental stewardship, we devised the Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds, a program that unites the voluntary efforts of private landowners, industry, environmental groups and state agencies toward a common goal."
"We expanded the Oregon Health Plan, giving hope to thousands of people, who -- through no fault of their own -- could not afford health care."
"We crafted the Oregon Children's Plan to ensure that our children get the support and attention they need to succeed in school, stay drug-free and become healthy, productive adults.The list goes on."
"We took the initiative in economic development, promoting Oregon business, international trade and enhancing our work force."
The silicon forest grew and flourished as our economy diversified and we saw the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
"But as 2001 dawned, we experienced the first inklings of misplaced faith in the durability of international markets."
"Cracks appeared in the foundations of those industries built on speculation and promise, rather than production."
"The value of equity stocks trembled, slipped, then nose-dived."
"Companies started to lay off workers, first by the score and then by the hundreds, and then by the thousands, leaving Oregon with the highest unemployment rate in America."
"And therein, lies our short term challenge -- an $830 million revenue shortfall due to our soaring unemployment rate and an increased demand for social services like welfare, food stamps and the Oregon Health Plan."
I have called a special session of the Legislature for February 8 -- one week from today -- to address this budget deficit.
"But that is only part of the picture, because we face a long term challenge as well -- less obvious, perhaps, but far more serious."
That challenge lies in the fact that our current level of state programs and services is not sustainable into the future based on the projected revenue forecast.
This projected discrepancy between revenues and expenditures is due largely to a series of choices Oregonians made in the last decade.
"In retrospect -- if it was shortsighted to hitch our future to industries built on speculation, rather than production -- it was equally shortsighted to delude ourselves into thinking we could cut our taxes, but not the programs and services that they supported."
"And, yet, that is exactly what we did throughout the 1990s."
With Ballot Measure 5 we reduced our property taxes and shifted over $4 billion a biennium onto the General Fund to finance education.
"We also cut our income taxes by nearly $1.5 billion through the 2 Percent Kicker -- again, without reducing General Fund programs."
"On the contrary, we actually increased what we expected the State to pay for with the passage of Ballot Measure 11, which set Oregon down the road to a billion dollar prison construction program."
So the challenge facing Oregon today is not just as simple as rebalancing the budget for the remainder of this biennium.
"The challenge is to do so in a way that not only addresses the immediate revenue shortfall, but which also puts the state budget back on a sound and sustainable financial footing into the future."
The debate that is unfolding involves two fundamental questions.
"First, how deeply should we cut current programs and services to help rebalance the budget?"
"And second, how should we pay for that portion of the budget that we want to preserve?"
The way in which we answer these two questions will have a profound impact on the kind of Oregon we leave for our children.
Let me start with the first question: how deeply should we cut current programs and services to help rebalance the budget?
"As we approach this question it is important to remember that, to a large extent, this is an exercise in values."
In the short term it is about how much we value our fellow Oregonians who -- through no fault of their own -- find themselves without employment.
Let us not forget that over $87 million of our revenue shortfall is due to the increased demand for public services by those who have been laid off.
"I can tell you from personal experience that our unemployment figures, as stark as they are, cannot begin to express the human hardship that ensues whenever an Oregonian loses their job."
"During Oregon's last recession, I was a freshman member of the Oregon State Senate."
I was also a practicing emergency physician in Douglas County where unemployment reached 22 percent.
"In my emergency room I saw first hand the human suffering that descends when proud people suddenly lose their jobs -- substance abuse, domestic violence, the disintegration of families."
Theirs is a hardship we cannot ignore as we move forward to address the state's short term fiscal crisis.
"In the long term, it is about the value we place on a strong system of public education -- primary, secondary and post-secondary."
"A system that gives all Oregonians, regardless of their background, ethnicity or economic status, an equal opportunity to master the skills and command the knowledge necessary to succeed in an information-driven economy."
"It is about the value we place on ensuring that every child born in this state has the support, the nurturing and the adult attention necessary to fully participate in, and contribute to, the Oregon community."
"It is about the value we place on compassion -- on providing a safety net for the most vulnerable among us: our children, particularly those at risk; the frail elderly; the poor who cannot afford health care for themselves and their families; those with disabilities or who suffer from mental disorders, who, if we do not extend them help as a society, will end up on our streets or in our jails."
I am not saying that there are not cuts that we can and should take -- there are.
I am simply pointing out that this is not as simple as lining up numbers on a piece of paper.
Behind the numbers are real people -- people with real lives and with hopes and dreams of their own.
"They are our neighbors, our employees, our children, and our grandparents."
This is not an accounting exercise.This is an exercise in values.
"Having spent a great deal of time working on this budget, I think that we can responsibly cut in the neighborhood of $400 million -- not without consequence -- but without doing irreparable damage to the important public programs and services on which our social and economic heath depends."
As a counterpoint to the legislative proposal to cut $481 million I have proposed to reduce state programs and services by $414 million -- and even that is pushing the envelope.
"My budget reductions were guided by four principles: First, to maintain our investment in education -- particularly primary and secondary education and undergraduate education in our post-secondary system."
"Second, to maintain a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens."
"Third, to maintain public safety."
"Fourth, to maintain our investment in prevention."
These two budget reduction proposals -- although they are only $67 million apart -- represent differences in both policy and priority.
They represent different sets of values.
"Nonetheless, I believe that we can -- and will -- reach consensus on the budget reduction side of the equation."
"More problematic, however, is the question of how we pay for that part of the budget we intend to preserve -- which leads us into the long term challenge."
The legislative proposal uses 14 different revenue sources to generate $348 million.
I have strong objections to a number of these sources because they violate a very simple premise: pay as you go.
"Two of these revenue sources tap into existing trust funds: The Common School Fund, and The Health Care Trust Fund created with tobacco settlement revenue."
These are trust funds -- with the operative word being trust.
They were created to build a principle from which interest would be derived to provide long term sustainable funding for specific purposes.
"The Health Care Trust Fund, for example, was established with the proceeds from the National Tobacco Settlement to provide a revenue source for health related purposes -- smoking prevention and cessation programs as well as providing health care coverage for the working poor."
The Common School Fund was established when Oregon gained statehood in 1859.
It has been building its principle for 143 years to provide an ongoing source of revenue for primary and secondary education.
To raid these trust funds in order to rebalance our current budget shortfall is irresponsible.Let's be clear.
"The only reason that these measures are being considered in the first place is to give political cover to legislators -- of both parties, I am sorry to say -- who do not have the courage to raise taxes nor the will to cut the programs that those taxes support.Here is how the argument goes."
If you are a Republican in the Legislature you want to stay in control next session.
So you can't possibly vote to increase taxes or to make deep cuts in education or programs for seniors because you might lose the election.
If you are a Democrat you want to win control -- so you can't possibly vote to increase taxes or to make deep cuts in education or programs for senior citizens because you might lose the election.So what do you do?
You try to find a way to rebalance the budget without raising taxes or cutting too deeply.How?
"By raiding trust funds, by borrowing against the future, or through accounting tricks."
"I approach this budget challenge on the basis of a very simple and straightforward premise: If we want to preserve programs in the face of the budget deficit, we need to pay for them not by borrowing, not by raiding trust funds set up for other purposes, not through accounting maneuvers but with real revenue options."
And I have proposed some real revenue options: Repealing or at least delaying the implementation of Ballot Measure 88 a tax cut (that has not yet gone into effect) which will benefit primarily those at the upper end of the income scale; Increasing the current tax on tobacco by 30 cents per pack to help pay for health care; Increasing the beer and wine tax by 5 cents per drink to help pay for mental health and drug and alcohol treatment.
I would point out that I am not alone in my view that additional revenue is required to meet the legitimate needs of the state -- and that now is not the time to implement tax cuts.
"Four Republican governors -- including Governor Jeb Bush -- have recommended delaying tax cuts, while three Republican governors have actually called for tax increases.Others are considering them."
My proposal will not only bring us back into balance for this biennium -- and slightly increase our ending balance -- it will also reduce the projected revenue shortfall for the next biennium from $1 billion down to less than $250 million.
"This proposal will preserve our commitment to education, to vulnerable citizens and to public safety -- and it will put the state budget back on a sound, sustainable footing without debt financing, without raiding existing trust funds and without resorting to accounting maneuvers."
"By contrast, the legislative financing proposal is a continuation of the shortsighted polices of the 1990's by which we were able to delude ourselves into believing that we could cut our taxes yet still maintain -- and even expand -- state programs and services."
"I am not just talking about Ballot Measure 5 and the 2 Percent Kicker -- I am talking about a mindset that recognized the need for additional resources in the state budget, but lacked the political will and fiscal discipline to pay for it with existing revenues."
"In both the 1997 and 1999 sessions, for example, I argued that we should use some of the surplus revenue generated by our robust economy to help finance the K-12 budget.I lost that argument."
It wasn't that the Legislature disagreed with the need for more funding for education.
They simply didn't want to vote to pay for it.
"Instead of using surplus revenue for this purpose, the Legislature allowed $420 million to be rebated through the 2 Percent Kicker and then turned around sold $277 million worth of lottery bonds to help finance K-12."
This money has now been spent but we will be paying the debt service on the bonds for the next 15 years at a cost of $412 million -- nearly as much as was rebated through the Kicker.
I do not believe that it is responsible to continue these policies -- nor to rely on existing trust funds to blur the very real relationship between state programs and services and the revenue that supports them over time.
"And I do not believe it is responsible to balance this budget by pushing payments due this biennium into the future -- in particular, the proposal under consideration to move the last K-12 payment into the next biennium."
This amounts to an additional $211 million cut in the K-12 budget in the current biennium with no guarantee that the next Legislature will come up with the payment.
"In a very real sense, this puts education last and is a continuation of the practice of making difficult political choices someone else's problem."
"We have an opportunity to end that practice, to be accountable to Oregonians for the dollars we spend -- and for the programs and services those dollars can realistically support over time -- and to put our state's budget and finances back on a firm footing for the future."
I have been around long enough to appreciate the historic symmetry of our current situation.
"Ten years ago, amid the ruins of the July 1992 special session called by Governor Roberts to find General Fund replacement revenue for Ballot Measure 5, a joint press statement was issued."
"It said, among other things, that: ""we have no intention of leaving unaddressed the fiscal problems created by the passage of Ballot Measure 5 We do not question the necessity of replacement revenue to responsibly provide for the legitimate needs of our state."
"And while there remains some debate concerning the magnitude of the revenue needed and the way it should be allocated, we are committed to reaching a bipartisan and bicameral consensus on both issues and dealing with this problem in a timely and effective fashion."
"The signators to this statement included myself, as Senate President, Speaker of the House Larry Campbell, then House Majority Leader (now U. S. congressman) Greg Walden, Representative (now state senator) Peter Courtney and Senate Majority Leader (now secretary of state) Bill Bradbury."
My point in sharing this with you is that there was a clear and bipartisan recognition that you cannot increase the demand on the General Fund to magnitude that Ballot Measure 5 did without providing additional revenue.
"Unfortunately, the agreement forged by the legislative leadership in 1992 was never implemented because the unsustainabililty of our fiscal policy was masked by a strong economy and video poker."
I am reminded of the passage by T. S. Eliot: We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.
We have been here before and we have the opportunity to address what we recognized by failed to act upon ten years ago.
My fellow Oregonians -- the challenge facing us today is not as simple as a choice between taxes and budget cuts.
"And we will do a great disservice to ourselves, to our children and to our own posterity if we allow the mindless ideology of the talk show host to be substituted for a thoughtful discussion of Oregon's future."
The challenge facing us today is one of accountability.
"The accountability to provide stable financing for those state programs and services that we think are important, that reflect our values, and that we want define us as Oregonians -- both now and in the future."
"And if these programs and services aren't important enough to pay for -- without borrowing against the future, without accounting tricks, and without leaving the decision on how to fund them for someone else to make -- then we should cut them.It's that simple."
Cutting deeper is certainly an option -- it is one choice to rebalance the budget.
"But make no mistake about it, it is also a choice for a different kind of Oregon than the one we know today."
"It is, after all, our commitment to each other -- to education and to caring for our vulnerable citizens and our natural environment -- that makes Oregon's definition of civic responsibility and quality of life different than that in texas or some other state.That is important to me."
"Two hundred years ago, Lewis and Clark had the undaunted courage to take up President Jefferson's challenge to go into the known in search of the Northwest Passage."
"At the end of their journey, they found Oregon this special and, to me, most wonderful place on earth."
Oregon is ours now our blessing and our responsibility.
We too must find the courage and the will to ensure its bright future.
