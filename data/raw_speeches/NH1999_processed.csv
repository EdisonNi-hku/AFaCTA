SENTENCES
"Madame Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Members of the House, Senate and the Governor’s Council, My Fellow Citizens of New Hampshire: This morning, I am proud to once again present to you a balanced budget."
It is an honest and responsible budget.
"As you are well aware, I present this budget under extraordinary circumstances."
The Supreme Court’s decision in the Claremont case has placed before us a challenge of historic proportions.
"Although we will resolve the Claremont case separately from this budget, the budget was crafted recognizing that we must solve the education funding problem.This is a lean budget."
It is balanced without any new taxes.
"I’ve made difficult but necessary reductions, cutting agency requests by more than $140 million."
"Wherever possible, we have leveraged our investments with federal funds and private contributions to provide relief to New Hampshire taxpayers."
"Aside from required obligations, this budget has an annual real growth rate of only 1.2 percent."
"With the exception of necessary new staff in the Department of Corrections, there will be no additional executive branch employees at the end of this budget cycle."
The capital budget I am presenting to you is the lowest since 1989.
"This budget invests only in those computer projects currently in progress, as well as in what is necessary to avoid Y2K problems."
We received a tremendous number of technology requests from agencies.
Capital budget requests alone exceeded $64 million.
"Absent a comprehensive strategy to meet our technology needs, I am not willing to fund all of these requests."
I’ll be initiating a process to evaluate our technology needs and determine how to meet them in as cost-efficient a manner as possible.
The increases in this budget are driven by required obligations.
"While we have worked hard to keep costs down, the state has made long-standing commitments that must be honored.We must fund debt service."
We must fund the state share of municipal employee pensions.
We must fund aid to cities and towns.
We must fund the Berlin prison.
We must fund retiree health care costs.
"The costs of retirees’ health care have shot up dramatically, increasing $10.3 million for the biennium."
This rate of increase is untenable.
I have directed the Commissioner of Administrative Services to find ways to reduce these excessive increases while continuing to provide quality health care for our retirees.
"Because state employees are paid every two weeks, approximately every decade an additional pay period is charged against the budget."
This calendar phenomenon will add more than $7.5 million in appropriations to the general fund in FY 2000.
"While I am required by our Constitution to pass on the Judicial Branch’s budget request intact, it is my belief that the courts’ requested level of funding can and should be reduced in each year of the biennium."
"It is incumbent on all branches of state government, including the judiciary, to prudently and wisely expend our financial resources.This is an honest budget."
It is not based on rosy scenarios.
It recognizes that the growth in revenue we have experienced over the last three years is expected to slow down.
It anticipates a modest surplus of $3.4 million at the end of FY 2001.
"Except for our Claremont II obligations, we would enjoy a $62 million surplus at the end of the current fiscal year."
"Instead, there will be only a small amount to split between the Health Care Fund and the Rainy Day Fund."
We have an opportunity to further shore up the Rainy Day Fund.
The terms of the recent tobacco settlement call for a one-time $16 million “signing bonus” that New Hampshire will receive once a critical mass of states have ended litigation.
One-time revenue sources such as this should not be spent on ongoing operating expenses.
I propose that this one-time $16 million payment go straight into the rainy day fund.
That’s the fiscally responsible thing to do.
"This is a budget true to New Hampshire’s traditions of fiscal responsibility and lean, cost-effective government.But that’s not all."
It is a budget true to our values.
It invests the New Hampshire way: carefully and efficiently.
"It invests in what we believe in, in New Hampshire’s strengths and in our future - and these are smart investments."
We believe in our children and we believe they deserve the best education and the brightest opportunities that we can provide.That’s a smart investment.
We believe in our families and in our neighborhoods.
"We want them safe, healthy, and secure.That’s a smart investment."
We believe in our economy and the businesses that sustain it - and us - with the jobs they create.That’s a smart investment.
We believe in the great natural beauty that makes our state so special and defines our quality of life.That’s a smart investment.
"This balanced budget is about smart investments, wisely and prudently made, in our natural resources, in our economy, and in our people."
This budget makes wise investments in education.
"It invests in improving our schools, ensuring quality by increasing accountability and raising standards."
My Best Schools Initiative returns the focus to the quality of our schools.
"The Best Schools Leadership Institute that I announced earlier this week will provide leadership training not only for teachers and administrators, but also for parents and community leaders."
"At a time when we will be assuming responsibility for hundreds of millions of dollars in school funding to ensure equity, it makes sense to commit a modest amount of funding to ensure excellence."
The Best Schools Initiative will strengthen local control of education while encouraging genuine accountability in our schools.
"And most important, it will improve student learning and achievement."
"This budget fully funds building aid, catastrophic aid, kindergarten aid, and tuition and transportation aid for vocational students."
Our commitment to education must also extend to higher education.
This budget includes significant funding for the university system -- 5 percent annual increases that will help keep the doors of higher education open to New Hampshire families.
"Without this investment, a public college education will become increasingly unaffordable to middle class families in New Hampshire."
We will lose the future business and community leaders we need to keep our state strong.
Too many of our best students are now driven out of state by the rising costs of higher education.
It is time we make the commitment to keep those students here in New Hampshire.
We’ve also increased support for our Community-Technical Colleges.
"For example, the capital budget provides support for upgrades to the libraries at the Nashua and Concord campuses so they will be eligible for college accreditation."
We are all justifiably proud that New Hampshire has the highest percentage of high tech workers in the country.
"If we are to maintain that distinction, we must continue to invest in our University and our Community-Technical College systems."
"And, because we should provide opportunity to every New Hampshire citizen, this budget also increases our support for adult basic education for the first time in 10 years."
Adult education is critical to the success of our welfare-to-work initiative.
"During the past 18 months, we have reduced the welfare rolls by more than 18 percent."
"Over 2,500 people have participated in employment and training services in the past year alone."
This is a tremendous accomplishment that should be continued.
Our economy is strong in New Hampshire and we must invest wisely to keep it that way.
This budget makes smart investments in economic development that will help us secure a prosperous future.
"We continue to invest in the Small Business Development Centers, which provide technical assistance to the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy."
"We maintain the Challenge Grants to help employers provide job training, so critical in these times when the labor market is tight."
"And this budget invests in child care so that parents can go to work, knowing their children are properly cared for."
We again increase investment in tourism promotion and advertising.
"For every dollar spent on tourism, we earn more than eight dollars in additional tax revenue and seventy-five dollars for our economy."
"This budget also invests in international trade, an area of significant opportunity for New Hampshire businesses."
And this budget invests in the roads and bridges that are our economic lifeline.
We include the hard money match needed to obtain over 81 million dollars in additional federal transportation funding over the next two years.
"That will make a real difference in our quality of life, the strength of our economy, and the safety of our families."
"With this additional support for transportation, we can reconstruct major portions of Route 3 in the North Country."
"Travelling through Nashua will be easier in the fall of 1999, when we complete construction of the Everett Turnpike and open the link to Hudson on the circumferential highway."
"And we will complete Route 101 by the Fall of 2000, three years ahead of schedule."
This budget also continues to get the red out of our red-listed bridges.
"With our increased investment, we will remove 32 municipal bridges from the red list."
Our investments in roads and bridges help our businesses and our economy.
They relieve pressure on local property taxpayers by helping cities and towns pay for the infrastructure so central to the life of their communities.
But that’s only part of the investment this budget makes in our local communities.
"For our cities and towns, this budget keeps an important promise."
We honor our commitment to local communities by providing significant resources to help relieve the burden of local property taxes.
This budget sends 525 million dollars - over half a billion dollars -- in total state funds to our cities and towns over the next two years.
"We have fully funded revenue sharing, including the additional rooms and meals tax revenue for cities and towns required by state law - an increase of 15 million dollars over the biennium."
New Hampshire’s natural beauty is invaluable to the quality of our lives and the strength of our economy.
This budget allows us to protect our natural environment while we expand our economy.
We invest in a new source water protection program that will preserve the land surrounding aquifers and well heads.
"In addition, we fully fund drinking water treatment grants, landfill closures and sewer projects - without spending one dollar more than we will spend in 1999."
"These investments enable local communities to preserve the environment, protect public health and relieve pressure on local property taxpayers."
"This budget invests in public safety - in prison space for violent offenders, safety on our lakes and rivers, and cutting-edge crime solving tools."
The Berlin prison will open in February 2000 at a significant but necessary cost.
"The Southern Area Halfway House, authorized last year by the legislature, will be operational as well, providing a safer transition into society for state prison inmates."
Three staffers for the state’s new DNA crime lab will be funded with state dollars so that we can keep pace with new trends in criminal investigations.
We also fund two new marine patrol positions to promote public safety on our lakes and rivers.
And we invest in the independence and freedom of some of our most vulnerable citizens.
We increase support for the meals on wheels program that enables seniors to remain in their homes and communities and not be forced prematurely into nursing homes.
The capital budget provides the funding to make our public buildings and parks as accessible to the physically challenged as they are to every other New Hampshire citizen.
We must do this to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
But we should do this because it is the right thing to do.
"In response to the findings and recommendations of a legislative study committee, I am putting half a million dollars in the capital budget to design an expansion of the Veterans’ Home in Tilton."
"Also in the capital budget, we recognize one of New Hampshire’s most famous sons, astronaut Alan Shepard."
"We honor his memory, increase learning and promote tourism by investing in the design and development of the Alan B. Shepard wing at the Christa McAuliffe planetarium."
"This summer, we will be promoting New Hampshire on the world stage, at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC."
This is a unique opportunity to showcase virtually every aspect of our state under the theme “Celebrating New Hampshire’s Stories.
"We will do this the New Hampshire way, leveraging public money with voluntary contributions from businesses and individuals."
"We make the difficult choices in this budget, investing in New Hampshire’s future in a way that is fiscally responsible."
"In doing so, we continue on the course we began together two years ago."
The state has benefited from our efforts.
"Despite the current uncertainty due to the Claremont II decision, bond rating agencies have affirmed our favorable bond rating, recognizing our state’s underlying fiscal stability and strength."
And we must build on that stability and strength for the next biennium and into the future.
"Two years ago the House acted responsibly, and sent the budget I presented on to a Republican Senate virtually unchanged."
"This year, I expect there will be the temptation to put partisan advantage over public interest, pressure to make irresponsible cuts that the Democratic Senate will be forced to restore."
"We can ill afford such political gamesmanship, especially this year."
"The choice before us is clear: our love for this great state and our concern for the people we represent can bring us together or, partisan politics can draw us apart."
We can demonstrate leadership or partisanship.The choice is ours.
"One course leads to responsible, honest, balanced budgets."
"The other leads to finger pointing, gridlock, and worse."
We have worked together in the past to great result for our state and its citizens.We must do so again now.
We share a commitment to the people of New Hampshire.
We share a concern for our state and a determination to secure a prosperous future.
"Let us also share a common vision for where and how we should invest in New Hampshire’s people, in our economy, in our rich natural resources, and in our future."
I look forward to working with you in the coming months.Thank you.
