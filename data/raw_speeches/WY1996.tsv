Today we take time to give special remembrance to two of the members of this Legislature.
We all were saddened with the untimely passing of our friend and colleague, Representative Ace Baty, and the sudden death Senator Bob Peck’s wife, Cordelia.
Bob wa s reminiscing the other night how much their grandchildren meant to them.
In particular, Bob mentioned three-year old Robert Henry, named after his two grandfathers.
Ace and Ann felt the same way about their children.
We are here today for young Robert Henry as well as Ace and Ann’s children - all those who are our joy and our future.
God Bless You, Bob.
God Bless you Ann.
Our hearts are with you.
We will dedicate this session to both families and to the extraordinary sacrifices whole families ma ke to support public service.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, state elected officials, members of the Legislature, our first lady, Sherri, distinguished guests, and citizens of Wyoming.
Thank you and welcome to the next round of creating the gove rnment of the future.
A special welcome to those of you joining us outside this chamber by other media.
I happened across a copy of the Denver Post published in 1956 which had several stories about Wyoming.
Among the stories was a discussion of the need for more school funding, especially to meet the demands for higher teacher salaries and school building s. And there was a story about the Barrett Building, built in 1952, and already overcrowded.
The State of Wyoming had already run out of office space.
Some problems never go away.
We will be together for about an hour this morning, counting all the remarks that will be made.
An hour.
That’s about the average daily time in school for a given subject.
Not too long, filled with substance.
I taught as a substitute teacher several years ago.
Standard procedure for measuring effectiveness has always been the use of student evaluations of the teacher.
One particular teacher I know was quite pleased with a student’s assessment of the teacher’s ability.
"The student had written on th e report ""If I knew that I had only one hour to live, I would choose to spend it in your class."
Wonderful thought!
Until the teacher noted an asterisk at the end of the comment.
"The asterisk directed the teachers attention to the reverse side of the p aper where the student had written ""That’s because an hour in your class seems like an eternity!"""
Welcome to Cheyenne, where 20 days in session might seem like an eternity!
Over the past year I’ve spent a lot of time listening to the people of Wyoming.
I’ve learned a lot about their concerns, their hopes and fears.
During the course of the past year I have attended several dozen town meetings, met with people individually in my office, talked to them on the phone, and answered my e-mail on the Internet.
But it’s not THEIR problems that I heard about, it’s OUR problems.
Our citizens said that we are concerned about jobs for ourselves and our children.
We are frustrated with the national government.
We are concerned about education.
We want to keep Wyoming safe from the problems of crime, and keep our children from co mmitting those crimes.
We want good health care.
And we want someone to pay attention to our personal problems.
Our citizens want change, profound long-term change, but they don’t want it just for the sake of change.
They want change that brings optimism and a sense of well-being.
And in this election year, they want leaders that they can believe in.
What is the state of our State?
THE WYOMING ECONOMY Let’s talk about the economy.
Our economy is growing.
Growing more slowly than some of our neighboring states, but growing.
Consistently in our town meetings Wyoming citizens said that they want economic growth and income growth, but not population g rowth.
So we will keep our focus on quality growth, not just any growth.
Wyoming’s personal income is up, compared to a year ago, and has gone up more than the rate of inflation.
The average pay for all jobs in Wyoming is forecast to be just over $24,000 with the average household income near $34,000.
In January last year, the unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.
Today it stands one and a half percent lower at 4.3 %.
Wyoming in 1995 had an estimated 294,000 jobs, up over 9 percent from our centennial year of 1990, and up by over 5 percent compared to the last of the boom years in 1985.
Minerals, Tourism and Agriculture still dominate the economy of our state, but th e three largest sectors for employment are services, government and retail trade.
Government provides 21 percent of all jobs in Wyoming, counting federal, state and local government.
That’s one out of every five jobs in the state.
The services sector at 24 percent provides about one out of every four jobs in the state.
Retail trade at 18 percent provides nearly one job out of every five.
The economic stalwarts in Wyoming, agriculture and minerals, each provide only about 6 percent of total jobs.
In ot her words, our state’s tax revenues depend on the businesses with the lowest number of jobs.
Minerals sector continues to have the highest personal income per worker, while agriculture and the retail sectors are the lowest.
The services sector is both the largest single employer group and also has the fastest job growth rate.
Within the services sector, business services and social services, many of which are tied to government activities are the fastest growing.
The sign ificance of these numbers is that when you consider all the jobs that depend upon government in Wyoming, either directly or indirectly, over half of the workforce in Wyoming looks to government as the source of its livelihood.
Consider further, that more than 10 percent of our population is over age 65, with a significant number concerned about government programs.
It’s not surprising then, that people in Wyoming take interest when the Legislature comes to town, especially to discuss the budgets.
Gove rnment is big business in Wyoming.
Add to that the fact that Federal land policies, particularly the Department of Interior, affect over half of the Wyoming economy, we as citizens have to be constantly involved in controlling our own economic future.
We are still the smallest state in the nation in terms of population.
That’s basically good news.
We suffer at times from a lack of access to certain services, but there are many offsetting benefits.
We still rank first of the 50 states in terms of air quality.
We have excellent highways and bridges although there is concern with the condition and quality of that infrastructure.
We rank in the top eight states in terms of high school graduation but very low in terms of college graduates as an overall percentage of the population.
Why?
Because at least two thirds of our college graduates leave the state.
We still have a brain drain.
On the good news side, we rank 11th out of the 50 states in the number of science and engineering students compared to the population, which should be a measure of our new business development potential.
But we rank dead last in terms of commerci alization of research and small business innovation financing.
We must correct that.
We rank 4th highest in the nation in per capita spending by tourists, which is a measure of the personal satisfaction of our tourism and recreation visitors.
Wyoming knows what hospitality is!
Bank deposits are up and so are loans.
The standard measure for economic activity is the Loan to Deposit ratio, which currently stands at 67 percent.
That’s high, although there are still many banks under 45 percent that would love to make more loans i f we had more opportunity in our smaller communities.
Overall, our economy is strong, but its foundation is changing, becoming more diversified.
Manufacturing and technology are the new growth areas.
The policies we develop, the laws we pass should focus on innovation and flexibility.
We need to push for greater productivity, better prices and adding more value.
We are a natural resource state with a liking for technology.
Competitiveness is our key to the future.
EDUCATION In November of last year, the Wyoming Supreme Court declared all of Wyoming’s school finance system to be unconstitutional.
The Justices' decision went far beyond what anyone expected.
While the focus of the decision was on finance and funding disparit ies, much of the commentary in the decision related to program equity.
Our challenge as a state over the next year is to match the vision of our state with the directives of the court decision to define a proper education system for our children’s future .
That education system must recognize the changing roles of our public schools, and it must incorporate our community colleges, and our University in the final solution.
The Court decision is a catalyst for change, not only in terms of funding but also in terms of teaching and accountability.
When Superintendent Judy Catchpole and I held education town meetings around the state people gave us a strong message: that they want good education and they are willing to pay for it.
But not without accountability.
"W e heard them say ""Don’t spend new money on old systems."
More than a few of our students, our teachers, many parents, and business leaders are frustrated with our school system.
Frustrated with concerns for safety and the lack of respect for staff.
Fru strated by the lower rate of mastery of the basics of education.
Frustrated with the fact that schools and our teachers are expected to make up for many of the social and medical problems of our communities, leaving less time to spend on academics.
The court decision has also stirred the debate over just what is actually meant by local control.
That issue is certainly worth some debate in this session to set a tone for the select committees work over the next year.
We have to provide for the immediate needs of our children and lay the groundwork for their future.
Tomorrow morning over 6,600 high school seniors will go to school in Wyoming.
What will happen when they graduate?
What will the job prospects be?
Hav e they been given the right academic or vocational training opportunities?
And we have just over 7000 kindergartners going to class tomorrow.
What will we do this session to provide opportunity for them when they graduate in the year 2009?
What we do today affects all those young people.
The Select Committee on Education has established an aggressive work plan that involves at least half of the legislators in the chamber this morning.
As those five committees pursue their tasks, both Superintendent Catchpole and I are ready to work with you.
With your leadership and our help, the result will be something you can be proud of, something that I can be pleased to sign, and Judy eager to administer.
But can our education system hold still until we come up with a solution?
We can’t put the needs of our schools completely on hold for at least a two year wait.
Even if legislation is in place that meets the Court deadline of July, 1997, the funding an d program changes would not be felt until well into the 97-98 school year.
The Superintendent and I originally proposed a 10 million dollar plan to begin the process of upgrading our delivery of education through improved technology and school staff development.
The appropriations committee was hesitant to approve that amount, especially considering that some schools already have technology plans or that some schools simply need more basic funding.
As a compromise, we propose that $5.4 million be allocated for the first year of the biennium to begin the innovation process.
The plan would require individual school districts to submit Technology and Comprehensive Staff Development Plans to the Depa rtment of Education.
Only with plan approval would the innovation funds be released to the districts for whatever critical needs the districts identify.
The prerequisite for the funds would be that each district has to submit a plan in two key areas: T o stimulate progress in technology and to provide staff development in our public schools.
We need good planning for technology and staff development as a means to transition to new delivery systems and effective use of technology.
The compromise would allow us to deal with critical needs in hard hit districts, while establishing a vision for future needs.
If we cannot give our kids everything they need, we must provide the basis for future learning.
We have to incorporate market based technology in learning.
We have a responsibility to ensure that new and emerging technologies are incorporated into scho ol programs or our graduates won’t even have access to the world of work.
HIGHER EDUCATION Our University and our community colleges are likely to be the most challenged by changes in today’s workplace.
We know, for instance, that states will receive at least 25 percent less in federal funds for employment and training programs.
The welfare reform programs will require people to work in order to continue benefits.
But work alone isn’t enough.
To stay off of welfare, recipients will need to improve knowledge and skills.
Community colleges in particular will have to adapt to provide convent ional courses at unconventional times and in unconventional places.
Joint programs with employer cooperation will become commonplace.
Access to electronic classrooms will become a necessity.
The high cost of higher education stretches the limits of all state budgets.
Wyoming has joined with several other Western states to develop a virtual university, with course offerings and degree programs that will be independent of physical locations.
Budget savings are the basic motive, but flexibility of programs and increased education quality are the eventual goals.
Institutions such as University of Wyoming will have to change management structures and accreditation procedures.
Eventually the prospect of technology based distance learning will benefit the public schools as well.
Vocational and employer training will more likely be delivered outside the traditional walls of our colleges and university at greater benefit to students as well as employers.
Partnerships will be developed between high schools and between schools and our colleges.
The economic growth that Wyoming people want will require significant changes to adapt to the needs of the new companies looking to Wyoming as a place to do business.
To move these actions along, I propose that we adopt a goal to have the equivalent of a community college available at every high school in Wyoming Change requires planning and investment.
I submitted a budget that included innovation funding for the community colleges and the University for transition to new delivery systems.
Our community colleges and University need funds for their own technolo gy innovations just as much as our public schools.
As I traveled around our state, I found extraordinary support for our community colleges but the role of the university is not as well understood.
I challenge you to support our University.
Let's make it a great university by partnering with our public schools and community colleges, though better program definition and accountability.
ACCOUNTABILITY and the State Budget Balanced budgets are required in Wyoming.
That’s why we watch the budget impasse in Washington with pure amazement -- battles over a plan that might provide the federal government with a balanced budget in seven years.
Ours has to balance every year!
And as our citizens lose faith in the federal government, it is all the more important for us, in Wyoming, to improve the services provided by state and local government in a way that restores accountability and encourages faith in the future.
With your help, we have cut the growth in state government.
For the first time in recent history the Executive budget recommends a decrease in total expenditures by the State.
We have reduced the total employment in state government by 247 positions.
But we are still delivering all the essential services of government -- and doing it better thanks to the hard work and loyalty of our state employees.
In 1994, the legislature passed what was known as SF 154, state agency plans, sponsored by Senator Mike Enzi, Rep Pat Nagel, and Rep Irene Devin, among others.
That mandated the process we now know as strategic planning.
And last year, you passed Senat e File 170, sponsored by Senators Kunz and Enzi and Representatives Tipton and Nagel, which mandated the process we now call performance based budgeting.
We are starting the process of implementing both concepts -- and I am pleased to report that the Cab inet and state employees have done extraordinary work in moving further along in six months than most states have done over three years on the same concepts.
I know that it has not been easy to follow the new process, but the rewards are worth it.
We wi ll all benefit from better information, better management and better services.
In town meetings that we held throughout the state, thousands of Wyoming people turned out to tell us what they liked or did not like about their government.
Most of you legislators attended one or more of those meetings.
As our citizens told us about their priorities, your cabinet directors listened.
You listened.
I listened.
The result is a budget based on priorities, and programs operated with accountable measures of success.
Never before has the public been so deeply involved in establishing the state’s budget.
FAITH IN THE FUTURE Faith in the future means making investments that offer hope.
Don’t just cut budgets - give our citizens hope, build with anticipation.
Be visionary, not reactionary.
In the budget I presented, I placed a heavy emphasis on accountability in government .
But I also proposed investments that demonstrate a faith in the future -- our opportunity to move forward.
Budgeting for the future means funding recurring expenditures with recurring revenues.
It means setting aside a reserve for contingencies.
I recommended a reserve allocation of $46 M which equals 5 percent of general fund income - a reasonable standar d. I also proposed an investment for the future.
Another $46 M was recommended from one time funds for projects in five categories: 1) Economic Development 2) Education 3) Technology 4) Innovation and 5) Equipment.
Five percent for reserves, and five percent for investment in the future.
Building equity creates opportunity.
No good business, or government, should stagnate.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT We know we must develop our resources.
And we know we must diversify.
But there are as many ways to diversify as there are communities in Wyoming.
Wyoming communities have many great success stories -- business achievements that reflect hard work, att ention and care by the people of the community.
But loans made to businesses from the state level have had a speckled record.
The 1995 Legislature ended the Amendment IV program in reaction to a series of economic loan failures.
But local economic development investment pools can be successful.
What was unwieldy -- or even impossible -- for a statewide committee, can be more accountably managed by business people in Wyoming towns.
Local business people know their own needs and know their neighbors, and they can lend guidance and monitoring for business start up and business expansion.
We can do that through the community challenge loan program.
"I support Senator Bob Peck and Representative Eli Bebout's bill for the ""Challenge Loan Program"" legislation."
Bob has been joined by Bill Hawks, Vince Picard and Curt Mier in the Senate.
Eli has enlisted co-sponsors John Marton and Ross Diercks in the House.
Effective development of our natural resources and commercialization of research are essential to economic development.
One way we can do that is through the state’s Science, Technology and Energy Authority.
Fifty percent of all national economic growt h since World War II has been generated by scientific research and technology.
Wyoming’s quality job growth needs to be linked to information technology and applied research.
STEA’s mission is to assist Wyoming’s economic development by means of targeted applied research.
Let’s focus on projects for STEA that will optimize the technological capability of Wyoming’s businesses.
STEA will focus on encouraging programs that upg rade the quality and streamline the production of Wyoming’s manufactured goods; support projects that increase Wyoming’s competitive edge in agriculture and tourism; and promote the growth of our small businesses which have provided over 50 percent of our job growth in recent months.
These two efforts, local economic development loans and STEA, do not provide the jobs -- they create the opportunity for others to succeed.
FEDERAL BUDGET PLANNING The fundamental relationship between the state and the federal government has changed.
Our federal government has no choice but to radically alter its fiscal policies.
That necessity of federal fiscal responsibility will force program changes.
And we can be sure that there will be less federal money over the next seven years.
That’s a sobering thought when you consider that the single largest source of income to state government is federal money.
Federal funds rank ahead of sales taxes, mineral inco me and interest earned on permanent investments.
Throughout most of last year, we all had a general optimism that the Congress and the President were going to shift program responsibilities back to state control and greater local accountability.
I am convinced that will still happen.
But in the time since I first prepared the biennial budget, the federal government has shut down twice and proposals to move toward block grants to the states have reached an impasse.
But now that the nation’s governors have developed a compromise, we should see progres s that should help resolve the impasse.
The shift from federal to state responsibility represents an opportunity to regain control of our resources and our government.
But at high risk.
We will be forced to accelerate the development of strategic planning, performance budgeting, benchmarking , and public/private partnerships.
Your attention coming into this session has been on reinventing education.
That is appropriate, but education could pale in comparison to what may come as a result of federal actions in other areas.
The budget for this session could not anticipate the major changes for programs in Medicaid, Welfare, Employment, Education, the Environment and the National Guard.
Major changes will have to be accommodated over the life of this budget, both in terms o f program administration and in terms of budget resources.
With the uncertainty of Medicaid and Welfare reforms, I strongly endorse the proposal of Representative Dorothy Perkins and Senator Charlie Scott to allow discretion for program changes over the next year to accommodate what finally emerges from the fede ral negotiations.
That along with budgetary flexibility, will assure that state services can be provided without the need for a special session of the legislature should the President and the Congress adopt a final resolution.
Presidential politics may delay any final resolution of the federal budget impasse until after the November elections.
If that happens, flexibility won’t just be a convenience.
It will be a necessity.
The worst possible situation would be a continuat ion of the present program mandates with the reduced levels of federal funds.
Without flexibility, Wyoming will be forced to pay for federal programs with state funds.
TECHNOLOGY The need for information and technology becomes even more urgent with the transition of programs back to the states.
It is likely that the federal government will require states to meet federal performance contracts using standards that can’t be met unl ess we have extensive new data and information reporting capability.
The federal performance contracts could add to state expense if we continue to use obsolete manually operated information systems.
Wyoming has to move ahead or we will be unable to tra ck government programs properly.
For example, under current federal legislation, states will not be able to receive Food Stamps as part of a block grant unless they have a statewide Electronic Benefits Transfer system.
Wyoming has pioneered this technol ogy and has become a model for several other western states.
Likewise, tracking of children’s programs and better services for court ordered placements will depend on better data and information systems.
Our Medicaid program will have to comply with new reporting requirements in order to allow savings under a managed care system.
PUBLIC SAFETY Education and economic development are avenues for opportunity.
But government also has an obligation to provide for public safety.
The great sense of security that we take for granted in Wyoming makes a tremendous contribution to our quality of life.
We must be able to deal quickly with any threat to that quality of life.
Unfortunately, Wyoming is not immune from violence and drug abuse.
I call your attention to two issues affected by these threats.
Our male prison population continues to increase.
We are getting tougher prisoners who stay longer and are even younger than ever before.
The Department of Corrections has handled this increase so far with proper measures.
But almost daily, operationa l and physical problems are aggravated by overcrowding.
We need to move ahead to construct a new maximum security prison.
Tomorrow at 4:00 your Judiciary chairs have scheduled a public meeting to listen to the consultants report on the prison needs for Wyoming.
This is the study you funded last year.
It was worth it.
But the study has rekindled the controversy over the recommendation to build the new facility in central Wyoming rather than Lovell.
I ask that you to confirm a site during this session so that finance and construction planning can proceed.
As part of the transition to a new prison, I also ask for authority to place prisoners in county and out of state prisons on a contract basis.
I was surprised to learn that Wyoming statutes are not clear on the governor’s authority to make placements ot her than in a state facility.
The second issue has less financial impact but has major impact on our ability to stop drug trafficking in Wyoming.
In Wyoming, we have traditionally used confiscated property and money to help fund local drug enforcement teams to combat drug related c rime.
These funds, leveraged with federal dollars, constitute the primary support of Wyoming’s war on drugs.
Most of your local law enforcement officials will verify the significance of this activity.
You have probably heard from a few of them.
Without this funding, we will have virtually no means to fight drugs in our state.
PENDING ISSUES I’ll comment briefly on other non-budget issues.
Property tax relief Easier than it sounds.
We need new ways to relieve the effects of spiraling property taxes.
The hard work of the Revenue Committee and chairmen John Hines and Mike Enzi has yielded several bills that could provide property tax relief to homeowners, or to improve taxpayers access to information.
Two bills look particularly promising.
The Circuit-breaker legislation could provide a tax deduction for qualifying homeowners.
Repeal of the confidentiality of statements of consideration could provide much needed assistance to taxpayers wishing to appeal their valuations and would allow county boards of equalization to have important information in making their decisions.
Game and Fish funding Wildlife management is the primary responsibility of the Game and Fish Department.
The Department has set a course of working directly with wildlife resources and the public.
But the traditional consumptive uses of wildlife are being displaced by non-c onsumptive programs such as nongame and endangered species management and watchable wildlife opportunities.
The consumptive use programs pay their way for the most part.
Non consumptive management services do not.
If we are to maintain the quality reputation of our Department, increased funding and diversity of funding are critical.
Those who hunt and fish are willing to pay their share, and I commend the efforts of the Department and the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee as they consider new fees and funding but we need to broaden the source of funds as well to support non-consu mptive game management.
Special Studies Two select committees have already received the support of the Management Council.
The Department of Revenue will continue the work on Title 39, recodification of the Revenue statutes with your support.
And the select committee on State Lands will begi n its work soon to bring recommendations for policies and management procedures to the 1997 General Session.
One strong recommendation that came out of last December’s Partnership Conference on Natural resources was the need to develop goals for land use and planning.
Wyoming doesn’t want to become a land of absentee owners with no control of our future econom y or our environment.
Health Care Nobody wants to be sick.
We all want good health and good health care.
And that’s good for our economy as well.
Community success in attracting or holding business depends on access to and availability of quality care professionals.
We should also pr ovide a strong program of disease prevention, especially through information and disease registries, and I will continue to push for personal responsibility for health care.
I commend two programs to you for this session.
The first is the WAMI program for graduate medical education in partnership with the Washington School of Medicine.
We need an average of 40 new primary care physicians each year.
Our current programs pr ovide less than half of that.
The others are recruited with the help of our Rural Health Office and the Wyoming Health Resources Network.
WAMI will focus on primary care, help develop rural health delivery systems and will allow our medical students to spend one third of their professional training in Wyoming.
I also support the formation of a public/private health information exchange.
I support the concept of a private sector match from hospitals, doctors, and other health support professionals.
The benefits are mutual.
We develop better support for our l ow population and enhance the management ability of the private sector.
I support the partnership approach.
And as the compromise is now proposed, it could solve the problem of funding for the tumor registry!
Partnerships - Created by the Legislature Telecommunications Last year you put Wyoming ahead of the rest of the country with the landmark legislation on telecommunications deregulation.
We already have one of the most market based systems in the United States.
We have improved cellular services and prices.
The long distance market now has 138 suppliers in Wyoming.
Internet access has improved dramatically with over two dozen suppliers and tremendously enhanced service options for our rural communities and schools.
We are in the process of implementing a rate based Universal Service Fund to guarantee phone service anywhere in the state.
All with your help and foresight.
Natural Gas The Public Service Commission has announced that the deregulation bill you passed last year has allowed approval of a plan by K-N Energy to allow retail customers to choose their natural gas suppliers.
That sets a new standard for competition and choice that should improve both gas service and price.
It also holds promise for gas produced on state lands to be marketed at an enhanced price to the benefit of our schools.
State Hospital One year ago you approved $1.5 M to begin the upgrade of services at the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston.
That was the catalyst for a whole series of actions.
We have a new hospital superintendent who has set a new standard for enthusiasm and energy .
The staff has been upgraded.
Community outreach programs are under way.
Active treatment and case management are better than ever.
The State through the Partnership agreement with Protection and Advocacy along with the Wyoming Association for the Me ntally Ill have agreed to work for permanent solutions rather than fight through the courts.
You provided the funding and flexibility.
Water Litigation and delays have so dominated our interstate relationships that Wyoming has spent more money on lawsuits than water development in the southeast corner of the state.
With the help of the Select Water Committee we are making new progress particularly in the Nebraska v. Wyoming litigation.
New people have been added to each state’s negotiating teams.
We are doing more work in-house using state’s attorneys at a savings to everyone.
And Governor Ben Nelson and I have met personally to move the negotiating te ams along.
In fact, the two of us will personally meet with our negotiating teams next month in Gering to push toward final resolution of the lawsuit.
WORKFORCE Last year we declared that Wyoming was Open for Business.
And we certainly are.
This year we need to focus on the workers, the employees that make business AND government successful.
We will start with the education reform that the legislature will co nsider this year.
Then the National Governors Association will meet in late March for a national push for improved education and workforce development.
We also have developed a Wyoming Workforce Development Council that will coordinate and integrate the activities of eight different state agencies who previously ran programs independent of each other with less than efficient training and development programs.
Welfare reform won’t work if people can’t work.
We know that technology and virtual universit ies are only a means to an end, not the end in themselves.
This year let’s acknowledge the people who make Wyoming work.
In May I will host a Governor’s Partnership Conference on Workforce.
I am also asking for authority to carry funds over into the next budget to allow merit pay and performance pay increases for our state employees.
CLOSING REMARKS Thank you for your time and attention, this morning.
Before, I turn the microphone over to the Chief Justice, I would like to take just a moment to reflect on the fact that today is observed across the country in honor of Presidents George Washington an d Abraham Lincoln.
Both men faced enormous challenges, developed consensus and made a profound difference in the lives of every American.
The work we do may have smaller consequences -- but we do in fact, affect the citizens of Wyoming by the choices we make.
Thank you all.
