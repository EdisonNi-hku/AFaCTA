President Jennings, Speaker Thrasher, distinguished members of the Supreme Court, Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan, members of the Cabinet, Honorable Senators and Representatives, distinguished guests, those watching on the Internet, and my fellow Floridians, thank you.
With great humility, I stand before you today to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the state of our state.
In this place one year ago, the late Governor Lawton Chiles delivered his final state of the state address.
With deep respect and gratitude for his unique public service to our state, I ask that you join me in taking a moment to honor his memory.
This is my first State of the State address as your Governor, yet it will be our last of this century.
As the sun sets on the final days of this millennium, we can rightfully take pride in Florida's progress during the past one hundred years.
Many Florida pioneers have left their mark on our state this century: from Henry Flagler's railroad building to Marjory Stoneman Douglas' lifelong love for the River of Grass, to Governor LeRoy Collins' courageous leadership.
The pioneers before us have transformed Florida from an undeveloped state on the nation's border into a superpower state with borderless potential.
That is the legacy of their labor.
Today, the state of our state is remarkably strong.
Incomes are growing, unemployment is low, and in the last two and a half years alone, over 110,000 Florida families have left the welfare rolls, a decline of over 50 percent!
But, while our economic indicators are positive, much work remains to be done.
Our prosperity today is merely an opportunity build on the legacy of those who came before us.
Together, we must work toward a shared vision in the next century to build: a state with a world-class educational system that does not leave a single child behind; a state with safe neighborhoods where children can play and elders can live without fear; a state where abused and neglected children, the developmentally disabled and frail elders receive the help they need in a compassionate way; a state where our urban cores flourish, providing hope and opportunity to those who need it most; a state where our natural resources are sustained for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations; and a state where government takes less of our money.
In 1999, this Legislature and this Governor must do our part to help Florida flourish in the next century by focusing on three R's: Resources, Reform and Relief - resources and reform for education and social services, and relief for Florida's taxpayers.
Education Even in a state with our great diversity of people and opinions, I think we can all agree that nothing will have a greater impact on our quality of life in the next century than the quality of our schools.
The alternatives are clear.
With an educated populace, our state will flourish with prosperity and renewed citizenship.
Without an educated populace, our state will wither away into economic irrelevance and we will be pitted against each other.
So our first priority must be education.
Over the last year-and-a-half, I've visited more than 200 Florida schools.
I have met with hundreds of dedicated teachers and principals who shared with me their firsthand reports about the challenges they face day-in and day-out.
I've listened to the hopes and concerns of thousands of students and parents.
And I learned that while many of our students are receiving the education that will serve them well in the future, we have an education system that is tragically leaving children behind.
Last year, 50 percent of Florida's 4th graders were not reading at the 4th grade level!
A recent survey showed that over one-third of Florida's 9th graders have failed to earn a C-average.
That's almost 60,000 fourteen-year-olds in our state that have a D or F average!
And another report released just a few weeks ago calculated Florida's 1997-98 high school graduation rate at 52 percent!
Together, let's send an unmistakable message for our children -- IN FLORIDA, FAILURE IS NO LONGER AN OPTION.
To fix this problem, we must first recognize that there is no silver bullet that will solve all that ails our educational system overnight.
Our efforts must be systemic and sustained.
Education will remain my top priority until we can honestly say that our system no longer leaves any child behind.
Today, as Governor, I make this commitment: I will never waver in my dedication to transforming our public schools into centers of educational excellence.
As a down payment on that commitment, in January, with many of you standing by our side, Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan and I announced our A+ Plan for Education.
Our A+ Plan will bring needed resources and needed reforms to our schools.
To provide sufficient funding, total spending on K-12 education from all sources will increase by over 1.2 billion dollars in our recommended budget.
And, to help alleviate crowded classroom conditions, 1.2 billion dollars in state money will be available for the construction and maintenance of schools.
This is the largest commitment of state resources to K-12 school construction and maintenance of any state in the nation.
But while our plan recognizes that our schools need more money, we must also recognize that our money needs more accountability.
Without powerful accountability measures built into the system, no quantity of money will give our children the quality of education they deserve.
So today, let's agree that our commitment to education must be measured not solely by the amount of money we pour into the system, but by the amount of knowledge poured into the minds of our children.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan for his vision and work in laying the foundation for bringing true accountability to our educational system.
Our A+ Plan builds on that foundation in many ways.
First, we will test students in grades 3 through 10 and grade schools on student achievement.
Parents will know how their schools are doing as measured by the one thing above all else that matters: whether kids are learning.
Second, we will no longer fool ourselves into believing it is acceptable to promote children to the next grade who aren't learning.
Social promotion gives everyone-students, teachers and parents--a tragic false hope, and IT MUST END.
To end social promotion and to help students meet necessary promotion standards, legislation before you today will dramatically increase funding for remediation efforts to over 400 million dollars and provide more flexibility for schools to solve this most pressing of problems.
Third, schools that improve and schools of excellence will be rewarded with additional funds and freedom to spend those funds based on the needs of that particular school.
"But if a school receives an ""F"" grade, we will help it, and not abandon it."
We will do all we can to turn that failing school around.
That school, with the assistance of the local school board and the state Department of Education, will receive financial assistance to develop and implement a comprehensive improvement plan that will be specifically tailored to its particular needs.
But even as we do all we can do to improve a failing school, let us at least acknowledge that no student in our state should be forced to attend a school that repeatedly continues to fail.
Research has shown that it is almost impossible to make up the effects of a year with little or no learning gain.
We owe children in failing schools real educational opportunities, not our apologies.
That's why I urge you to support giving Opportunity Scholarships to children in chronically failing schools.
A student in a failing school deserves a quality education as much as a student in a successful school.
It's time we give these students the educational opportunity they desperately need.
With true accountability in our schools, the good ideas being considered by this Legislature such as class size reduction, school readiness, and extension of the school year will have a chance to work.
If we provide our schools with additional resources and accountability reforms, over time, we can make our educational system a shining beacon of excellence that will give all of our state's children the life-long benefits of a world-class education -- but we must make that commitment now -- not next year -- not in two years -- but NOW.
Helping the Most Vulnerable In my travels throughout our state, I have been fortunate to meet so many of Florida's quiet heroes-those who care for their loved ones, tending to their needs with great difficulty and intense financial pressure.
When the total state budget has more zeroes than the average calculator can compute and once we've memorized the alphabet soup of agency acronyms, it's all too easy to lose sight of the reason we are here -- to serve people.
I'd like to read you an excerpt of a letter that I received about a month ago that I think helps put our work here into perspective.
Dear Governor Bush, [A friend] thought I should write you about.
an emotional common experience that almost any mother of a child with disabilities endures.
It goes without saying that the most horrific experience that any mother would face would be the death of a child.
However, this is quite the opposite for mothers of children with disabilities.
Our most common fear is that our child will actually survive us.
We pray that we will live long enough, that our strength will last, and that somehow we can make it financially to outlive our children.
This is something that is quietly talked about among us when we are with each other.
Who will love them?
Who will keep them safe from abuse?
Who will get up in the middle of the night?
Who will lift them out of their wheelchairs?
The answer has been no one.
"We have all seen what happens ""after the mother dies."
Our experience is that our children are rejected both financially and emotionally from their communities.
It is quite profound to realize that these silent lessons learned over the years have had this end result.
But it is true.
And this is the story of only one Florida family.
So many other Floridians find themselves in equally vulnerable positions: from the thousands of children in the foster care system awaiting adoption to the thousands of senior citizens awaiting community care.
They are people whose names you will never know, whose faces you will never see, whose stories you will never hear.
These are our fellow Floridians, and even in this time of plenty, they are in great need.
But while their needs are great, our present system is drowning in an ocean of federal lawsuits, waiting lists, and obsolete bureaucracy.
As in education, now is the time to bring the right resources and the right reforms to our social services system.
Let us work together and seize the opportunity to improve the lives of Florida's most vulnerable citizens.
We should do this to reform our child welfare system, to prevent the grotesque abandonment, abuse and neglect of children in our state.
To help restore a sense of compassion in how we protect the most innocent among us, I ask that you increase funding for child welfare by 101 million dollars, a 24 percent increase.
We should do this to eliminate the Community Care for the Elderly waiting list of seniors in need of community-based services.
I ask that you approve my budget recommendation to allow 14,000 seniors to receive the care that they need at home to stay out of nursing homes.
We should do this to reduce by over 50 percent the people with developmental disabilities awaiting needed services, and to redesign the system in a dramatic way.
I ask that you approve my budget request of an additional 210 million dollars.
And finally, to ensure the best use of the funds from Florida's tobacco settlement, I have proposed the creation of the Lawton Chiles Tobacco Endowment for Children and Elders.
This endowment will be initially funded with over 1.1 billion dollars of tobacco settlement monies, will grow to over 2 billion dollars in four years, and will provide in perpetuity a dedicated source of revenue to fund the increased needs of Kidcare insurance program, child welfare, and our aging-in-place programs.
I urge you to approve the creation and funding of this endowment in honor of Governor Chiles and in honor of good conservative government.
But along with these resources, we must also provide reforms to ensure the effective use of every tax dollar.
There must be a bold, new approach to providing human services in our state.
The unaccountable, system-centered model that we now have is as obsolete as the 20th century is about to be.
Our new approach must be compassionate, community-driven, responsive, and most importantly, accountable to those it serves as well as to our taxpayers.
I look forward to working with the Legislature in the coming months to redesign our service-delivery system to make it more choice-based, consumer-directed, family-centered, and quality-driven.
With the right combination of resources and reform, we can create a system that compassionately meets the needs of Florida's most vulnerable citizens.
Historic Tax Relief In addition to providing resources and reforms in education and social services, we must also give our citizens relief.
Let us never forget the unmet needs of Florida's families.
Most families now need two incomes to make ends meet.
Incredibly, government at all levels now consumes 40 percent of median family income.
Parents delicately balance the economic and emotional needs of their children with the stressful demands of their jobs.
Most of our elders are fearful that they will outlive their life's savings.
Former welfare recipients fighting to achieve economic independence struggle every month to pay for their basic necessities.
And these are the so-called good times.
When hard times hit our state earlier this decade, our state and local governments asked the people of Florida to make do with less.
This decade alone, state and local taxes were raised almost four times as much as they were cut.
Because Tallahassee needed more money to provide for the needs of the state, Floridians responded to their government's call to sacrifice AND THEY MADE DO WITH LESS-they had less money to buy groceries, less money to provide child care for their children, less money to enjoy their golden years, and less money to lift themselves up from poverty.
To keep faith with its people, this government cannot force its citizens to make do with less during bad times if it is not willing to share prosperity with its citizens during good times.
We MUST show greater respect for the earnings of the people of our state.
Our citizens need tax relief.
That's why I've proposed a broad-based tax relief package of 1.2 billion dollars - to help seniors, homeowners, working families and small businesses.
Rebating taxes for 7 million utility bill payers through utility bills will ensure that our tax relief is broad-based.
Reducing the intangibles tax will provide relief to Florida's seniors and small businesses.
Reducing the unemployment tax will help businesses create more jobs.
Cutting property taxes will help everyone who owns property who has seen their average property tax rates increase by 18 percent in the last decade.
In their entirety, these tax cuts will enhance Florida's economic competitiveness in an equitable and broad-based manner.
They will improve our state's business climate, help sustain our economy and bring new jobs and opportunities to our communities.
For the average Florida family, with our tax relief proposal, we will provide the equivalent of 6 million weeks of groceries for Florida's families, six million months of electricity, or 30 million fill-ups of the family car.
I've listened to those who don't believe in this sensible tax relief proposal.
It seems that from their point of view, every tax dollar that Tallahassee takes, Tallahassee must spend.
To them, I respectfully offer a new credo: IT'S NOT OUR MONEY.
The people of Florida have sent us here to work for them-for the single mom with two jobs and two kids, for the small businesses struggling to keep their doors open, for the former welfare recipient battling to achieve independence.
They did not send us here to search for new ways to make them work harder and longer for us.
We must not allow the prosperity and abundance that our citizens have earned with hard work and sacrifice to be totally consumed by a government with an unlimited appetite for more tax dollars.
Those of us in Tallahassee must learn to trust Floridians to keep more of what they earn.
We must change the nature of government's relationship with its citizens, and now is the time to begin the change.
Four Fronts, Florida Forever and Front Porch Florida And beyond those top three priorities, we will also have an opportunity during this Legislative session to fight the scourge of drugs in our communities, preserve our natural resources, and create economic opportunity in our urban cores and rural areas.
Our state has been in need of a drug control strategy, and I commend Senate President Toni Jennings and the Florida Senate for their year-long process to build a consensus behind a comprehensive strategy.
Our budget recommendation increases funding by 80 percent to fight this battle on all four fronts: awareness, prevention, enforcement and treatment.
My wife, Columba, and I are personally committed to fight this fight on every front.
To criminals who commit violent crimes with a gun, our message must be plain and clear: use a gun, and you're done.
I ask that you pass 10-20-Life legislation during this session to provide certainty of punishment to criminals who use guns in the commission of a violent crime.
Future generations will benefit from the state's investment over the past 10 years in Florida's natural resources through the Preservation 2000 program.
It is imperative that this Legislature develop a successor program that builds on the accomplishments of Preservation 2000.
And while we preserve our natural resources, we also need to begin the process of connecting our urban cores and our rural areas to the rest of the state and not leave them behind.
I've proposed a plan called Front Porch Florida that will release the power of local communities in Florida's urban cores to revitalize their neighborhoods.
There will be many other issues this historic Legislature will work on, but there's another element to this that's important to me---we must do the people's work with civility and a sense of inclusiveness.
While it's been noted that this is the first time in 130 years that both houses of the Legislature and the Governor's office have been controlled by the Republican Party, I prefer not to dwell on the historical significance of that fact.
It is more significant to me that the people of our great state, in their final election of the 20th century, have chosen each one of us, Republican and Democrat, to serve them and to lead them into the 21st century.
We cannot let them down.
We must give them partnership and progress, not partisanship and pettiness.
We have a historic opportunity to do what is right.
Let's not blow it.
I pledge to work with each member of the Legislature -- Republican, Democrat, African-American, and Hispanic from our most populated cities to our rural communities.
Let's show the rest of the country what dedicated public servants can accomplish when they work together with a shared vision.
With energy, passion and courage, I ask you to join me so that we can seize our state's challenges to create a better quality of life for all Floridians in the 21st century.
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless Florida forever.
