SENTENCES
"I stand before you today to report on the state of our state for a fourth time as your Governor, grateful on behalf of Ruth Ann and myself for the opportunity to help lead our state into the 21st century."
"These past four years, all of us have worked together to prepare Delaware to succeed in that new century and well beyond."
Every member of this General Assembly -- and every Delawarean -- can take pride in what we have accomplished.
"By honoring our commitments to our residents, and delivering real results to secure the long-term future of our state, we are keeping Delaware first."
"This afternoon, I'd like to take some time to touch on a few of our successes and to outline an aggressive agenda for 1997 and the years to come."
"Today in Delaware, our economy stands among the strongest in the nation."
January has been a month of more good news.
The nation's top rating agencies re-affirmed our highest bond rating in state history.
We are among the top five states in the nation for attracting new business growth and jobs.
Our unemployment rate -- averaging under five percent last year -- remains well below the national average.
"Earlier this month, we welcomed proudly the production of the Chevrolet Malibu, Motor Trend's Car-of-the-Year, to GM's Boxwood Road plant, and we also helped unveil the brand- new Dodge Durango that soon will be manufactured at Chrysler's Newark plant."
Both plants have seen fear and doubt transformed into hope.
"Thanks to a lot of people who refused to give up, the long-term future is bright for those facilities, and for thousands of Delawareans who work there."
One of the reasons we've been so successful in attracting and retaining jobs has been our ability to create an environment in which businesses can grow and prosper.
We've cut personal income tax rates twice and pushed our top rate below seven percent for the first time in almost four decades.
Reducing the personal income tax isn't all we've done to make our state more attractive for residents and business.
"We've cut the gross receipts tax, the public utility tax, and unemployment insurance taxes."
"We've created a tax credit for new bank jobs, lowered the franchise tax for banks meeting a high-income threshold, and increased and expanded the Blue Collar Jobs Tax Credit."
It's no wonder that the Fortune 100 ranks Delaware as the best state in which to locate or expand a business based on tax policy.
We are truly keeping Delaware first when it comes to creating a climate which fosters economic opportunity.
"Thanks to a vibrant economy and a welfare reform plan that is the model for our nation, we've helped almost 6,000 Delawareans move from welfare to work."
"In an effort to lend a hand up instead of a handout, we are providing the health, education, and child care supports necessary to enable thousands of families to reach self-sufficiency through hard work and personal determination."
"In education, we've raised standards in each of the core academic subjects and strengthened graduation requirements."
Disruption programs in all 180 public schools are helping to ensure that schools are safer places where children can concentrate on preparing for success in college or the job market.
"With strong private-sector support, we've launched several innovative charter schools and also have introduced an element of competition in public education."
"Public school choice attracted more than 5,000 applicants in its first year, with an overwhelming majority receiving their first choice of schools."
Access to the information highway in all public school classrooms will become a reality by September of 1998.
"To help protect our environment, we've slashed emissions into the air by more than half and into the water by more than 90 percent."
"At a time when development and growth seem to be encroaching on all sides, we have preserved nearly 30,000 acres of open space and prime farmland, and placed another 86,000 acres into agricultural districts, for future generations to enjoy."
"All of this we have done, and more."
But now is not the time to step back and congratulate ourselves.
Now is the time to forge ahead and recommit ourselves to confront the serious challenges that remain -- challenges that our forefathers 200 years ago could not have imagined: How will we sustain our economic pre-eminence in a climate of fierce competition?
How can we capitalize on the emerging shift in power between the states and the federal government?
How do we deal with a prison population that has increased by nearly 40 percent since the Lt. Governor and I took office in 1993?
How do we tackle the intense social pressures that are tearing at the fabric of our families and neighborhoods?
How will we balance the need for jobs with our pledge to protect the environment and manage sprawl?
These challenges will require us to work together in unprecedented ways -- to roll up our sleeves and tackle these thorny problems head-on.
The decisions we make in the 139th General Assembly will largely determine the kind of place that Delaware will be at the dawn of a new century.
Let me reiterate what I said a week ago.
I want us to be first in the nation -- the place where other states look for answers to the critical challenges of our time.
We are fortunate to begin this new General Assembly in a position of strength.
"Because we have built on a strong tradition of sound fiscal management and maintained a vibrant economy, our revenue picture remains bright."
"The nation's most respected bond rating agencies reaffirmed that our economy is strong, diverse, and well-poised for continued growth."
But we must remain ever-vigilant to ensure that we are not caught unprepared for the future.
"In an effort to ease the burden on our residents while creating a healthy business climate, we have rightfully focused on cutting taxes."
"Just as important, we have provided reductions in a thoughtful and responsible way, ensuring that we could sustain these cuts over the long haul."
"I will continue to support responsible tax cuts when possible, and I will propose several today."
But I will not allow us to sacrifice our ability to provide the services which Delawareans truly need.
"With that in mind, our Administration will work with the Joint Finance Committee to craft a balanced and responsible budget which keeps spending growth under five percent, while fully funding the Rainy Day Fund."
"The cost of maintaining existing levels of service will consume most of our projected revenues, leaving relatively little room for new initiatives."
We all know that the budget-writing process will be fraught with pressures on both our operating and capital budgets.
"We are faced with rising student enrollment, requiring us to hire additional teachers and buy more classroom materials."
Aging school buildings and more students will require capital investments exceeding $200 million for schools over the next five years alone.
Rising costs in our long-term care Medicaid population threaten to swallow up funds required to meet other vital needs.
Keeping law-abiding residents safe from harm requires more prison beds on-line yesterday.
"Later this week, I will send to the General Assembly a ""completion"" bond bill with no new projects."
"In doing so, I propose that we utilize additional revenues that emerge between now and June to finish some of our larger projects ahead of time, bringing them on line sooner, and saving millions of dollars in construction costs and interest payments to boot."
Our tradition of solid fiscal management and planning has served us well -- placing us among the top ten states in the nation.
My proposals are designed to bring Delaware a step closer to the AAA credit rating that has eluded us thus far.
"CRIME Regrettably, the fastest growing part of state government -- here and elsewhere -- is criminal justice."
No issues are of greater importance to Delawareans than crime and the safety of our neighborhoods.
Fighting crime requires vigilance on many fronts.
"It involves the most talented professionals we have, and thousands of volunteers, as well."
"It begins in the home with parents teaching their children to respect the law, and extends to our schools and neighborhoods."
"Over the past four years, Delaware has taken bold steps to keep violent criminals off our streets, to prevent future crimes, and to spare future victims."
"To better protect our communities, we increased mandatory sentences for habitual violent offenders, convicted drug dealers who carry guns, and pedophiles who prey on our children."
"To make sure these laws are enforced, we've put more officers on the street and invested heavily in technology to give law enforcement the tools they need to do their jobs better.It is not just more policing.It's better policing."
We've brought new community policing initiatives to Kent and Sussex counties.
"In our fight against domestic violence, we launched a new State Police Domestic Violence Unit, specifically charged with targeting domestic violence cases in each county."
"This session, I will propose legislation to further strengthen protection-from-abuse orders, as well as legislation prohibiting the possession of a gun by anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime.Still, we must do more."
"We have seen a disturbing rise in shootings this past year, especially in the City of Wilmington."
One major reason for this violence is the influx of guns and drugs into our state.
"All too often, guns and drugs go hand in hand."
"A few years ago, our law enforcement community warned us that Delaware was in danger of becoming a ""source state"" for the illegal purchase of handguns.Those fears have come true."
"Since 1994, the number of firearms seized in criminal investigations and traced back to Delaware has increased significantly."
"Few, if any, of those guns were being used by their original owners."
Part of the reason for this trend is that Delaware has not kept pace with our neighbors.
"Unwittingly, we have created an attractive business climate for gun runners."
Delaware is the only state in the region which does not require a criminal records check for the sale of used guns.
Over half of all handguns sold in Delaware are sold by private citizens.
"To make Delaware less attractive to criminals in the business of guns and drugs, I will propose legislation to require record checks on the sale of all handguns -- new and used -- in Delaware."
"I will also propose legislation to prohibit the possession of ammunition by convicted felons, as well as the possession of handguns where the serial number has been destroyed; and legislation that will require stolen guns to be reported to law enforcement."
New laws alone will not get the job done.
We need a concentrated law enforcement effort to attack this trade in our most vulnerable communities.
"This week, I will ask State Police Colonel Alan Ellingsworth to convene a special meeting of our state's police chiefs to work on creating a new state strike force to better coordinate our resources in fighting guns and drugs."
"I will ask for the assistance of our congressional delegation and the Clinton Administration, as well."
"We need to send a strong message to criminals from New York to Washington D. C. when it comes to trading drugs for guns, Delaware is closed for business."
"With tough new laws and more cops on the streets, we have seen a corresponding increase in our prison population."
"Today, we have over 5,000 inmates in our prisons - facilities which originally were designed to hold only 3,100."
"Until now, we have talked about the overwhelming costs of this expansion, both in terms of one-time capital expenditures and increased operational costs."
"Now, we are about to witness the fiscal reality of this initiative in next year's budget."
"Over 35 percent of my capital budget, excluding transportation, will go to prisons."
"The Department of Correction will need to hire almost 300 new, full-time correctional officers this coming fiscal year alone."
That is more officers than the entire New Castle County Police Department and results in more new full-time positions than were recommended in the entire state budget last year.
"As staggering as these costs are, we will be planning our next prison expansion soon after this one is completed if the growth in our prison population continues at its current rate."
We must find ways to stem the rising tide of our growing inmate population.
"The first question to be asked is: Who is this population, and why do they end up in our prisons?"
"Statistics show a very high percentage come from poor, single-parent families, sorely lacking in educational or vocational skills."
Eighty percent of our prison population are serious drug abusers.
Many who make up our prison population have been to prison before.
"Reflecting the national average, recidivism rates are often as high as 70 percent."
"In most cases, drug abuse plays a major role in repeat offenses."
What can we do to break this cycle?What works?
"As many of you know, here in Delaware we have a tough, discipline-based drug treatment program that has become a model for the nation."
"Our Key and Crest initiatives have produced remarkable results on a small scale, attracting the attention of the U. S. Department of Justice, state criminal justice systems nationwide, and even the President of the United States."
"Of the prisoners who completed our rigorous Key and Crest in-prison treatment and work release programs, 76 percent were drug-free and 71 percent were arrest-free after 18 months."
Compare that with the recidivism rates of a control group where only 19 percent remained drug-free and only 30 percent remained arrest-free after 18 months.
"Completion of the Key and Crest programs by inmates means 40 percent fewer crimes committed, 40 percent fewer victims, and 40 percent fewer prison beds."
"For those reasons, I will propose in my recommended budget that we nearly triple the scope of these programs in fiscal year 1998."
"As we move forward with our huge prison expansion effort, the time is right to set a new course for those prisons."
"I want to create a prison system where addicted inmates with a sentence of one year or more will spend the last year of their sentence in the Key drug treatment program, followed by the Crest work release program, and then aftercare."
I want a prison system that will demand the discipline and commitment these proven programs require.
"Our Key and Crest programs are not right for everyone who goes to prison, though."
"For those who only spend a short time in our prisons, we must create a ""no-frills"" prison where inmates are expected to work and are afforded few privileges."
We must impress upon these individuals that prison is not a place to which they want to return.
The department has already begun developing such a plan to unveil this year.
"We must also improve vocational training in combination with inmate work programs so that inmates may begin to work for society, instead of against it."
"To help accomplish this task, I will propose we begin transferring the responsibilities for our prison vocational program from the Department of Correction to our award winning vo-tech school districts."
"By utilizing their expertise, we can greatly enhance the quality of these programs."
I believe that this new approach to our corrections system will begin to turn the tide of Delaware's growing prison population.
These are things we must do to help make our prisons a place where people become better citizens -- not better criminals.
"On this battlefront, we cannot afford to fail."
"But if we are truly to succeed, our efforts to fight crime must begin long before people reach our adult prisons."
We must redouble our efforts to stop today's generation of troubled youth from becoming tomorrow's prison population.
Many of these kids have already shown a propensity toward crime and violence -- both in our schools and in our neighborhoods.
They often end up in our juvenile facilities.
"For some, their crimes are so serious they can no longer be treated as kids."
"For them, we have no alternative but to sentence them to -- and segregate them in -- adult prison."
"But for those who can be led more readily back to the right path, we must provide juvenile facilities that nurture, educate, and discipline."
"In a few short weeks, our new Ferris School -- with its improved programming -- will open its doors and begin a new chapter in youth rehabilitation in Delaware."
"YOUTH CRIME PREVENTION/EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION At Ferris and in our communities, our efforts to reduce crime must focus on children and their parents."
All the cops and prisons in the world won't protect us if we don't diminish the supply of new criminals.We know the root problems.Poverty.
Too many children born out of wedlock.Absentee fathers.
Too many children subjected to violence and neglect.
Too many children who arrive at school already hopelessly behind.
Too many students who leave elementary school and still can't read.
Too many kids who do not know or obey basic norms of social behavior.
Too many kids allowed to roam the streets unsupervised.
"The obligation to address these problems starts with parents, families, and communities -- not with government."
Government cannot substitute for the love of two fully committed parents who are mutually devoted to their child's success.
"But we can provide poor children the same educational opportunities as middle-class children, and by expecting all children to behave decently and to achieve at high academic levels, regardless of their class, race or gender."
"Two years ago, our state launched a Comprehensive School Discipline Program that improves school safety, enables our schools to demand higher standards of behavior, and gives our most troubled youth the extra support they need."
"Not only that, we've provided funds for extra instructional time and built momentum behind an effort to engage 10,000 Delawareans in school-based mentoring programs that help more kids to learn and to improve their self- esteem."
These efforts improve children's lives.They also help prevent crime.
"This year, I am asking the General Assembly to take several additional steps to address the problems of at-risk children which lead to crime."
These measures comprise a strong Youth Crime Prevention and Early Childhood Education agenda for our state.
"To ensure that at-risk children get off to a good start, I am recommending the funding necessary so that all parents who need parenting education can get it."
"To better ensure that children arrive at school ready to learn, I am recommending expansion of the state's Early Childhood Program so that every four-year-old in poverty in Delaware will soon have access to Head Start."
These pre-school investments must be followed up at the school level.
American children spend far less time in school than their peers in Japan and Germany.
The lengthy summer break especially harms poor children.
All of us remember -- and many of us have children who now experience -- Septembers in public schools devoted to relearning what was taught the previous May.
"In the next century, academic achievement will be even more important than it is today."
"It is time to recognize that if all of our children are to reach the rigorous academic standards we've set, we must provide many of them with substantial amounts of extra learning time -- or be prepared to watch them fail."
"To that end, I am proposing the funding necessary next year to provide a full month of extra instruction -- 20 school days -- for the lowest achieving students in kindergarten through sixth grade."
"School districts may provide this targeted instruction during the summer, after school, on Saturdays, or provide full-day kindergarten."
"As an integral part of this effort to improve academic achievement, I am also recommending expanded funding for grants to additional schools that wish to start school-based mentoring programs to help struggling students."
"Finally, I am proposing to strengthen the Comprehensive School Discipline Program by increasing base funding for Part II of the program to strengthen school partnerships with the Children's Department, police agencies, and community-based organizations, and to increase emphasis on prevention and anti-drug abuse efforts."
These investments will help our schools better address the family and social problems that give rise to school disruption and academic failure.
"Coupled with a strong economy and our support for working low-income families, this Youth Crime Prevention and Early Childhood Agenda will do as much as anything our government can do to deter young people from lives of crime."
"If involved parents and caring communities also do their part, we can give our children a brighter future and make Delaware a safer place for all of us."
EDUCATION Delaware is undertaking these prevention measures in the context of our State's overall education reform program -- a program that focuses on two key words: standards and assessment.
"Delaware was among the first states to adopt rigorous academic standards that clearly define what students are expected to know and be able to do at different grade levels in core subjects such as math, science, English and social studies."
These standards have won national acclaim.
They have been in the hands of Delaware teachers for nearly two years now.
"Special funding for professional development and new textbooks, tied to the state standards, has been appropriated by the General Assembly."
The standards should now be entering the day-to-day lives of children in classrooms throughout Delaware.
"Just as every meaningful human endeavor needs a standard or goal to meet, so too does it require a test of whether the goal has been reached."
That is the job of educational assessments: to measure whether students are meeting the standards of academic achievement we have set for them.
"Instead of simply asking students to complete multiple choice questions, these assessments also require students to write essays or to explain how they solved math problems."
The end result should be a more accurate and rigorous method of evaluating performance that goes well beyond rote memorization to determine whether students understand the key concepts they are learning.
"In the Spring of 1998, the state will administer its first set of assessments tied to the core standards."
"The test will measure student achievement of English and math in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10."
This next step will challenge our commitment to our children's future well being.
"We all know that unless there are consequences -- positive and negative -- attached to any task, then that task is not taken seriously."
"Participants in the education system, starting with students, must be held accountable for whether the state standards are achieved."
"At this critical juncture in Delaware's education reform, I am asking the General Assembly to take a limited, but profoundly important, step by requiring that the new state assessments in the core subjects be designed to hold students accountable."
"That means that these tests should be capable of helping us to determine, for example, whether students go on to the next grade level, or receive a regular high school diploma."
"The new assessments should also be designed so that students can receive positive rewards for attaining quality scores, such as scholarships and merit diplomas."
"The decision as to how to use these accountability measures, and when they go into effect, should be debated and addressed over the next several years."
The commitment to an assessment that enables Delaware to adopt such measures should be made this year.
Standards and assessment produce high performing graduates in other nations because there is student accountability.
The time has come for us to make our own commitment to accountability in Delaware -- and that time is now.
"That commitment to accountability must not just extend to students, but to parents and to our education system as a whole."
"We've taken steps to introduce more accountability through public school choice and charter schools, more rigorous teacher certification standards, and the publication of better information about our public schools.We've cut down on regulation."
We've empowered local school districts and schools themselves to make bold decisions without state micromanagement.
"By moving decisions closer to the people, we are creating a more responsive and effective local school system."
"This year, I want us to make our state education agency even more accountable to the people of Delaware."
"That is why I am asking you to create a Department of Education, headed by a Secretary of Education nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate."
"Our doing so will enable the people of Delaware to hold this governor and future governors directly accountable for how that agency performs, while giving the General Assembly a better opportunity to fulfill its oversight function."
"Last week, the House passed legislation to do just that by an overwhelming margin."
"This week, I am asking the Senate to do the same."
"A more effective state Department of Education can be the people's advocate in education, providing Delawareans with high-quality information about their local schools' spending practices, educational programs, and performance."
"A more responsive and accountable Department of Education can also serve as a source of innovation and technical advice, and better meet the needs of local districts."
"To meet the challenges of the 21st Century, Delaware must produce students with excellent skills."
"The way to accomplish that objective is to set high goals for our students and to be resolute enough to hold them, their parents, and our education system, accountable for meeting those goals."
This is the year we must make that commitment.
STRENGTHENING OUR ECONOMY So much of our future depends on an excellent education system and the workforce it must produce.
Developing that workforce is the key to a strong economy and keeping and attracting quality jobs.
"When our Lt. Governor and I began our first terms, Delaware's economic outlook was far less optimistic than it is today."
"But thanks to a bold strategy, undying enterprise, and a little luck, we've created an environment that gives every Delawarean a chance to find work and succeed."
"Four years later, our economic goals have not changed."
We must strive to make Delaware a place where parents can earn enough money to feed their children and provide them with good homes.
"A place where companies can take root, grow, and prosper."
A place where individuals -- bound only by the limits of their own enterprise -- forge better lives for themselves and their families.
"Four years ago, I launched what we called a ""grow our own"" economic development strategy with four key elements: 1) fostering the expansion of Delaware's existing businesses, particularly our small businesses; 2) investing in Delaware's infrastructure; 3) running a government that keeps taxes and red tape to a minimum; and, 4) creating a quality workforce.That strategy has not changed."
"As the 21st Century approaches, we must build on our economic strengths to ensure prosperity."
One of our biggest strengths is a thriving financial services industry.
"That industry employs more than 26,000 people today and has added more than 2,500 jobs in the last two years alone."
We must continue to build on our success.
"On the first of this year -- with the help of the General Assembly -- we reduced the state's bank franchise tax and established a ""challenge bracket"" to spur further growth."
"This year, I will propose legislation to improve and make more efficient our banking regulatory process."
"And, I will continue to visit personally the top management at financial institutions throughout America to tell them about what we have to offer here in Delaware."
"Banking isn't our only strength, though."
Delaware also is the home to the highest number of scientists and engineers per capita in the nation.
"To build on that advantage, I will recommend an additional $4 million from the 21st Century Fund for our Advanced Technology Centers initiatives which hold great promise for creating high- paying jobs in new technologies."
We're also moving forward in our efforts to bring the high-tech semiconductor industry here to Delaware.
"As we do so, we must continue to recognize the role small business plays in forging a strong economy."
"To that end, I will recommend two new ""storefront"" Small Business Development Centers -- one in Dover and one in Georgetown -- building on the phenomenal success of the one-stop, storefront center we opened last summer in downtown Wilmington."
"We also have enjoyed tremendous success in improving access to capital, including venture capital."
"Using only $5 million in public moneys, we have leveraged more than $100 million in public- and private-sector funding to help promising businesses grow and thrive."
"We will continue to support the Delaware Venture Partners initiative, the Delaware Innovation Fund, and the Delaware Access Program as they support the promising ideas of entrepreneurs and inventors, and their small, growing companies."
"During my first term, we cut business or personal income taxes in each of the last four years."
"This year, I will recommend that we reduce Delaware's public utility tax, and make that tax more equitable for purchasers of gas and electricity."
"On the recommendation of the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council, I am also proposing that we reduce unemployment insurance taxes further, and raise the maximum weekly benefit for unemployed workers."
"In addition, to further reduce government red tape, I will recommend again the eliminating the Second Injury Fund for workers' compensation -- with no decreases in benefits."
"Perhaps most importantly, we will remain vigilant in our efforts to provide a responsive, customer-friendly government which allows businesses to grow and thrive here, while meeting their responsibilities to the community."
"We want to build on the successes of General Motors, Chrysler, Playtex, Bio-Medic, Johnson Controls, Zenith Products and others."
"In keeping with those successes, I am proposing an additional $10 million for the Delaware Economic Development Office's Strategic Fund."
"As some of you know, the first time I ever saw Delaware was from military aircraft as a young naval flight officer."
"I was struck then, as I am now, by the natural beauty of this state."
"From the rolling hills of the piedmont in western New Castle County, to the vast stretches of fertile farmland south of the Canal, to the miles of sun-drenched beaches along the Sussex coastline, Delaware is blessed with a picturesque landscape that few states can match."
I learned after living here just a short time that Delaware also is blessed with communities and a quality of life that have made it a wonderful place to live and raise a family.
"One of the biggest challenges that we face today is to preserve this small wonder of a state -- our precious farmland and agricultural industry, along with our open spaces and natural areas, while maintaining a vital and expanding economy."
We cannot continue with the current sprawling development pattern in Delaware and preserve our natural resources and community character.It's that simple.
"Sprawl eats up valuable farmland, open space, and natural habitat."
It stresses our existing transportation system and is more expensive to service with water and sewer facilities.
My Cabinet Committee on State Planning Issues has developed a set of goals for Delaware through a series of statewide workshops and a number of public meetings.
"The Shaping Delaware's Future goals are the blueprint guiding our state's capital investment, as well as our assessment of the counties' comprehensive land use plans."
Our state goals seek to guide new development to existing towns and communities and to designate growth areas by targeting state infrastructure investments to these areas.
The more difficult and controversial task is to discourage and restrict development outside of the growth areas.
It is this process of directing and restricting growth that is our biggest challenge.
"In order to be successful, we must do it with a sense of balance and fairness."
We must recognize the property rights of farmers and landowners.
"We must maintain our vital economy, and, at the same time, we must protect open space and the character of our communities."
"I recognize the tremendous interest of the legislature, all three county governments, our business community, and thousands of other Delawareans in how Delaware grows and how its land is used."
Each of us has our own ideas about the best ways to move forward.
There are some areas of agreement and some areas of sharp contrast.
I believe the time is right to try to forge a consensus.
The Delaware Public Policy Institute has offered to sponsor a summit for that purpose.
Its success requires that we trust each other to do what's right for Delaware.
"Today, I am putting my full support behind this effort."
I urge the legislature and everyone who shares my view to do the same.
One critical area where we know we must find consensus is transportation.
The most common complaint that we hear from residents of communities confronted with new development near their homes is traffic.
Building a transportation system which supports our vital economy and which provides adequate mobility for our citizens is not easy.
"If it were, someone would have done it years ago."
We now are playing catch-up to development that has occurred over the past decade.
"For us to be successful, Delaware's Transportation Trust Fund must have adequate resources to unclog congested intersections, to preserve and maintain the capacity in our existing system, and to expand capacity in growth areas."
"At the same time, we must realize that we cannot build ourselves out of all our traffic problems."
"We need to provide transportation alternatives that preserve capacity on our roadways, while giving us cleaner air to breath."
The capital budget which I'll submit this week will include a proposal to increase revenues for transportation.
"I recognize that there are many opinions inside this chamber, and outside of it, on how to provide more revenue for transportation."
"I believe the best way to guarantee funding for needed transportation projects is to enhance the dedicated user fees already supporting the fund, while holding the line on operating expenses paid by that fund."
I hope the General Assembly will come to share that view once all the alternatives have been carefully reviewed.
"To meet the challenges of managing growth well, we need the best efforts of all Delawareans."
"In Delaware, we have a history of working together and taking decisive action."
"When confronted with a problem or challenge, we pull together, Democrats and Republicans alike, public sector and private sector, to find solutions that work."
I pledge to you my very best efforts on this difficult front and ask each of you for the same.
I have shared with you this afternoon a snapshot of the preeminent position that Delaware enjoys today among states.
"I have shared with you, as well, my candid views on some of the steps we need to take over the next few years if we truly are to help lead this country into the 21st century."
"Whether it's fighting crime, making sure that kids stay in school and out of trouble, fully implementing standards and assessments in education, injecting greater accountability throughout our school system, or balancing the need for a strong economy with our desire to ensure that Delaware remains a special place to live and work, the challenges we face are not easy ones."
Let me end my remarks to you this afternoon with a simple observation: I stand before you today as the last governor of this century and the first governor of the next.
Our first four years of working together were filled with accomplishments in which each of us can take pride.
"Now, as we look forward to welcoming the next century, we are fortunate to have the talent and resources to overcome some of the most serious challenges that face our state and nation."
"The question confronting us is this: ""Do we have the will?""I believe that we do."
The agenda I have outlined for you today builds on our successes of the past and adds to them.
I recognize that some of the issues I have discussed are controversial ones.
Some will require difficult choices from each of us.
"But that is our task, our responsibility to the people who elected us, just as it has been for Delaware governors and legislators for 210 years."
"Our own history beckons us, not to look back, but to move forward, not to settle for mediocrity, but to be the best."
"Working together, we will lead our state into the 21st Century, confident in the strength and ability of the people we serve, committed to keeping Delaware first.Thank you very much."
