"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Legislature, Honored Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, A century and a half ago, Charles Dickens wrote about a time when residents of London and Paris found themselves in the midst of ""the best of times"" and ""the worst of times."
Their cities, institutions, economy, and culture had achieved great successes, yet they still faced daunting challenges that could undermine that progress if lingering issues like poverty remained unresolved.
Louisiana finds itself in that same position today-having achieved notable successes but still facing significant threats to our continued progress.
We have put our fiscal house in order.
We have prioritized our spending, cut taxes more than we raised them, become number one in the nation in debt reduction, improved our bond rating, invested in technology, reduced staff in government bureaucracies, put merit on equal footing with seniority in our civil service system, and earned national recognition for managing the state's money wisely.
We have reformed our education system-and again earned national recognition for our school accountability program.
More important than recognition is results.
I'll say it again: nine in ten schools improved last year; seven in ten met their growth targets and earned rewards.
Our fourth graders had the highest gains in a nationally administered math test; our eighth graders were among those from six states that made improvements in both math and reading.
We must stay the course on accountability-and that means maintaining high standards and adequate funding.
We have turned the tables on higher education funding.
We reversed a two-decade old pattern of cutting higher education and have instead jumped into the top five states in terms of increased funding for our colleges and universities during the past five years.
These investments will help provide the workforce and the intellectual firepower to drive Louisiana's economy into the 21st century.
We have given new hope and opportunity to our children and their families-using federal TANF funds to implement universal PreK for at-risk children and extending Medicaid eligibility to provide health insurance to more than 140,000 children through LaCHIP.
We have brought honesty and integrity back to government.
"The citizens of this state know that I do not tolerate insider-deals, corruption or cronyism, or putting ""who you know ahead of what you know."
I will never let Louisiana go back to the days when government was used for personal gain, not for the public good.
On every one of these issues, the legislature has stood strong with me.
I thank you for that, and ask that you maintain those commitments.
But, as you all know, we continue to face many challenges.
Our teacher salaries have increased faster than all but two Southern states over the past six years, but they still trail the regional average.
Our higher education funding remains lowest in the South, despite our increases.
Our state police pay is less than that of many local police and sheriff's deputies, a security issue that is even more critical in light of September 11.
Our crime and incarceration rates are still too high, keeping too many able-bodied men and women behind bars when they should be making a productive life for themselves, their families, and their children.
Our twenty-year history of out-migration threatens future economic growth, leaving Louisiana short on the workers who have the most skills at a time when baby-boomers are beginning to retire and we need them most.
Our weak educational performance in the past has left us with an economy more reliant on resource extraction than on entrepreneurship, innovation, and invention-the characteristics necessary for success in the 21st century.
And our poverty rate-while improving in the past decade-still leaves tens of thousands of Louisianians without the basic resources they need to make it through the day.
It is something that should embarrass us, and should provide us all the motivation we need to keep fighting to educate and empower our citizens until poverty is licked in Louisiana.
Make no mistake-we have made significant progress on every one of those issues over the past six years and on many others.
We have a lot to be proud of.
But, like the situation in Europe about which Dickens wrote, our successes in Louisiana are fragile.
The challenges we face in such a poor state could easily overwhelm us and reverse our progress if we are not careful.
This is my seventh year as Governor, and this is my seventh address to open a regular session of the legislature.
Each of the past seven years I have laid out a challenge to the legislature to fix something big-reforming our civil law system, bringing Medicaid under control, modernizing the management of our charity hospital system, creating a community college system, reorganizing the governance of higher education, fixing our workforce training system and creating the biggest training fund in the nation, and revitalizing our economic development efforts.
Each year you have risen to the challenge.
This year the challenge is no less than before.
In fact, this one may be more important than all the rest-because it is necessary if we are to secure those gains.
"Our goals this year must be to provide tax relief in the areas where it is most needed and to end this ""Dance with Death"" over temporary taxes that threatens our progress."
"No other state in the nation has a system like ours, where as Rep. LeBlanc says, ""we buy and sell the state"" every two years to get taxes renewed."
We do not need these taxes to be temporary.
We do not need these taxes to be permanent.
We need these taxes to be eliminated.
It is insanity.
It is stupid.
It is irresponsible.
It costs the taxpayers of our state every time we have to do the horse trading to pass these taxes.
It prevents us from developing the political consensus to move forward on any type of tax cuts or reform.
The Dewitt-Hammett-LeBlanc plan takes critical steps in the right direction.
It provides real tax relief in the areas we most need it.
It phases out the taxes on groceries and household utilities-which disproportionately affect the poor.
This tax cut will not end poverty in Louisiana, but it will make life for those struggling to make ends meet just a little bit easier.
It phases out the sales tax on manufacturing machinery and equipment-which PAR and CABL and LABI have shown to be out-of-whack with other states and represents the most significant business tax impediment to economic growth.
It phases back in the state income tax credit for federal-itemized deductions-giving tax relief to those who have pulled the wagon for so long.
It ends the fiction of temporary taxes.
This plan cuts taxes in a manner that is sensitive to the economic conditions of our state.
As the economy expands, the taxes are cut.
If the economy expands rapidly, then taxes are cut deeper and faster.
This won't help me politically, because I'll be gone.
But it will help all of you who remain in the legislature, and the next governor, move Louisiana forward.
It is rational because it provides tax cuts when we can afford them, but never forces the state into a budget crisis during an economic slowdown like the one we've experienced since Sept. 11.
That is the very time when our citizens need government help the most.
It protects our gains in education and health care, because those are the areas that are threatened every two years when taxes are up for renewal and which always get cut whenever we have a budget crisis.
It is conservative because it puts a cap on the amount government can grow-and therefore forces state government to continue pruning its bureaucracies and reducing staff, to continue prioritizing, and to continue becoming more efficient.
It provides a stable platform upon which further tax reform can be built.
Because we will no longer be living with a budgetary soap opera every two years, our bond rating will improve.
The cost of financing projects will go down.
In short, we will be getting more bang for our tax buck.
It will work.
The tax cuts may not occur every year-only when state revenues grow by three percent or more.
But had we chosen to start reducing these taxes a decade ago with the same triggers as are being proposed today, all of the tax cuts would have been implemented during that ten year period.
Instead, as you may remember, we cut inventory taxes, eliminated the inheritance tax, and cut payroll taxes.
This year's tax cut plan returns money to the taxpayers, puts Louisiana on the road to financial stability, forces efficiency in government, and protects our gains in education, health care, economic development, and infrastructure.
There will be those who will want to push us farther than we can afford to go.
We cannot go farther than I have proposed.
Period.
Ten years is the length of time President Bush's tax cut will take to implement.
If ten years makes sense to the President of the United States, then it makes plenty of sense to Mike Foster.
Remember, if this plan had been implemented ten years ago, today we would be celebrating the end of these temporary taxes.
I remind you that Louisiana is still a poor state, with many unmet needs and many citizens who depend on government health care through Medicaid and the charity hospitals.
We are still behind in teacher pay and in higher education funding.
Investing in education must remain our top priority if we are to secure a place for our citizens in the knowledge-economy of the 21st century.
There can be no compromises there.
I will not let the clock be turned back to the days when higher education funding was plundered and our future sacrificed.
If after a few years of experience with this plan, the next governor and the next legislature believe we have sufficient funds to accelerate the cuts, it can be done then.
But let me remind you of the perils of imprudent budget management-about what happens when you have unsustainable spending growth or unaffordable tax cuts.
Dozens of states find themselves in that very situation today-forced to raise taxes, make significant budget cuts, or to play games with their finances just to balance the books.
Seven states have already raised taxes, and more will undoubtedly do so before their budgets are balanced.
Twelve states are cutting K-12 education funding and 29 are cutting higher ed.
In Mississippi, higher education will suffer a second consecutive budget cut-last year's was the biggest cut to higher education anywhere in the country.
And the Governor there still is faced with Medicaid cuts he finds unacceptable.
Thirteen states are dipping into their rainy day funds.
Sixteen states are using their tobacco settlement to balance the budget.
Tennessee just spent the next four years of its tobacco settlement balancing this year's budget!
"In California, they are planning to ""securitize"" their tobacco settlement like we did-but get this-instead of putting that big lump-sum payment into trust as we did, they will use it to plug budget holes."
Virginia, Nebraska and Florida are cutting back on economic development incentives to save money.
Louisiana does not have an easy budget year this year-just ask Commissioner Drennen or Chairmen LeBlanc and Dardenne.
But because we were conservative over the past six years-and especially last year when things looked to good to be true and we wisely held back on new spending and built a surplus-we can manage our way through this year's budget without raising taxes, making unacceptable cuts, or raiding our tobacco settlement.
But we can do it only if we pass the Dewitt-Hammett-LeBlanc tax plan to get rid of temporary taxes and provide a rational plan to give tax relief without creating budgetary instability and threatening education and health care.
And as I have asked you before during fiscal sessions, I ask you again to hold the line on new rebates, credits, exemptions or exclusions.
Being conservative means being prudent.
Being conservative means not counting your chickens until they are hatched.
Being conservative means investing for the future.
We have taken a long-term approach with managing our state's fiscal affairs, and we must do that again this year with our appropriations.
Our information technology investments from last year are already paying huge dividends-LSU has been working closely with Caltech to become one of only a handful of universities involved in the TeraGrid project, a $53 million, multi-year effort to develop the world's largest, fastest, and most comprehensive internet distribution infrastructure for open scientific research.
LSU is poised to be the only Southern university to join this elite crowd-and only because you all made the necessary investments last year.
My proposed new investments in PreK, in teacher pay and the MFP, in community colleges and universities, and in the biosciences are all long-term in nature-and are vital to moving Louisiana forward in economic development.
I will not sign a budget that cuts these investments.
The Louisiana Opportunity Fund-for closing deals-is critical as well.
It goes hand-in-hand with the Quality Jobs Act and other incentives you passed last session.
We now have the most competitive job creation incentive in the country, the best package for film and video production, and have jumped into the game in the areas of research and development, technology commercialization, biotechnology, and custom software.
Thank you for your help and support on those bills.
We don't live in an Ivory Tower.
The states around us compete for jobs with incentives and we must too.
I agree with PAR that education must remain our number one priority-it always has been and will be for me-but we cannot tell those families that are thinking of moving away from Louisiana that we aren't willing to fight for the jobs they need today.
Despite what some say, I have always believed that and have always worked hard to bring jobs to Louisiana.
In fact, I am proud to announce today that Georgia Pacific will be opening a second major expansion in East Baton Rouge Parish-thanks to one of those incentive programs called tax equalization that I used to secure these brand new facilities.
Their first expansion created 110 jobs that pay an average of $60,000 when they installed a new $100 million tissue machine.
The second expansion, adding a $188 million paper towel machine, will create another 110 jobs that average $70,000.
In both cases, these incentives made the difference between these expansions coming to Louisiana or going elsewhere.
The future looks bright for the folks who will get these jobs, but also for the rest of our citizens.
We have made extraordinary progress working together and have laid the groundwork in education and economic development for Louisiana to become a real player in the growth industries of the 21st century.
We have restored people's confidence that government can do well that which it is supposed to do in the areas of education, transportation, health care, economic development, public safety and homeland security.
We have proven that we can do it without falling prey to the politics of the past or insider deals and political corruption.
We have proven that we can do it without diving into taxpayer's pockets at every turn.
This year we can make permanent that progress.
"We can secure ""the best of times"" for our future by eliminating those taxes that make us stand out like a sore thumb."
We can force continued efficiency and downsize government bureaucracies while steadfastly maintaining our investments in education and health care.
The choice is ours-and it is about whether Louisiana moves forward or gambles with all of our progress.
I ask that you stand with me to secure our state's future.
Thank you.
God bless you.
God bless Louisiana.
