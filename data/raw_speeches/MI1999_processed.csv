SENTENCES
"Lt. Governor Posthumus, Speaker Perricone, Majority Leader DeGrow, members of the House and Senate, Chief Justice Weaver and the Supreme Court, colleagues in government and my fellow citizens: Tonight, I am pleased to report on the state of our state."
Unemployment below the national average for five years in a row .. .
"One-half million mothers, fathers and children up and out of poverty ."
". . New jobs created this decade, more than three-quarters of a million ."
. . My friends -- the state of our state is better than good.It is GREAT!
"Tonight, we welcome the 90th legislature with a new Senate Majority Leader, a new House Speaker and 64 new House members."
"Thus begins the era of term limits, but there are no limits on what we can accomplish when we all work together!"
"So in that spirit, let us resolve to work hand in hand to make sure that our children are well schooled, our people are high skilled and that Michigan is first in the 21st Century!"
"My goal is for Michigan to be known the world over as the ""Smart State"" where the economy is strong, government is small, streets are safe and schools are second to none."
"We begin tonight, where we must, with education, for there is no higher priority."
"Not to dwell on our successes, which have been many -- but to deliver even more.Why?Our children!They deserve the best!"
The quality of our future depends on the quality of our schools.
Better schools and skilled graduates equal higher incomes and stronger families.
"We have 1.7 million reasons to get it right -- our 1.7 million children who get on the bus, go to class, raise their hands, do their homework and dream about the future."
"In classroom after classroom across our state, I have seen the good work that's being done by our children's teachers."
Their dedication is making a difference.
A critical measure of the state of our schools is student performance.
And I am pleased the news is quite good.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Michigan is on the right track.Test scores are rising."
Last year's gains were the best ever.
Our schools are getting better!
"As students master reading, writing, math and science, they prepare themselves to participate fully in life and Michigan prospers."
"So tonight, I propose, for all Michigan high school graduates who master reading, writing, math and science, that we reward your achievement."
"Each of you will receive a Michigan Merit Award -- a $2,500 scholarship that can be used for further study at a Michigan school of your choice."
"It is important we reward students who play by the rules, study hard, achieve on their tests and meet high standards."
And we should inspire even more to raise their performance.
"You are Michigan's future, and we will invest in you."
I have a message for students in those critical middle school years.
"Your studies are important, too."
"I further propose that all of you who pass your 7th and 8th grade MEAP tests in reading, writing, math and science be awarded $500."
"Then, when you successfully complete high school, your total Michigan Merit Award will be $3,000."
"Every student is eligible to participate -- every student -- whether attending public school, private school or home school."
The Michigan Merit Award Trust Fund will be endowed by money from the recent tobacco settlement.
That is why every member of Congress from Michigan must stand up for our children and fight those who would try to take our money.
Michigan's children are depending on you!
Our Michigan Merit Award will make college more affordable and will reward achievement and hard work.
Legislation creating the trust fund and scholarship will soon be before you.
Let's get this done for our kids!
"Last week, the President highlighted education in his State of the Union Address.He said, ""We must do better.I agree."
"The President also said, ""All schools must end social promotion.I agree."
"He said, ""New teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subjects they are teaching.I agree."
"He said, ""We must empower parents with more information and more choices"" and that ""parents should have more choice in selecting their public schools.I agree."
"He said, ""All states and school districts must adopt and implement sensible discipline policies.I agree."
"Finally, and perhaps of most significance to Michigan, the President was very blunt when he said: ""We must ."
. . support what works and stop supporting what does not work.
. . [A]ll states and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools -- or shut them down.I agree.
"In fact, I don't see how anybody could disagree!"
"Just weeks ago, Mayor Dennis Archer was very direct about the urgency of the problem in Detroit schools when he said, ""For the great majority of our children, we are not even close to giving them the education they deserve.Sadly, I agree."
President Clinton and Mayor Archer make it clear.This is not a partisan issue.This is not a racial issue.This is a children's issue.
"We -- the governor and the legislature, representing all the people of Michigan -- have a moral obligation and a constitutional duty to act."
"No more committees, no more reports, no more excuses!The time to act is now!"
"I propose that Michigan follow the example of Illinois, where to dramatically strengthen accountability and improve education, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley was given the power to appoint the school board and shake up the system."
"Courageous reformers -- crossing racial, ethnic and partisan lines -- came together, crafted a bold plan and are fixing that city's schools."
"The results are impressive: Test scores are up, attendance is up, graduation rates are up and standards are up."
"Fraud is down, waste is down and corruption is down."
"Social promotions are gone, and summer school is back."
Let's embrace Mayor Daley's call to action.
"Here's what he said: ""So much is riding on our schools, that each day I ask myself and those around me -- what more can we do to make our schools the best they can be?"""
I have thought a lot about that question.
"You've heard me say ""the state with the best schools wins."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Michigan must have the best schools."
"So tonight, I call on you to give Michigan mayors the authority to break the bureaucracy, fix the schools, and put our children first!"
Each community and its needs are different.
"That's why my plan strengthens local control so that a Mayor Archer, a Mayor Hollister, or a Mayor Logie can tailor local solutions to meet local needs."
This bold reform will make a positive difference in the lives of children who desperately need our help.
"The bottom line isn't party or race, money or power."
"It is the children, and we must stand up for them!"
A look at our school budget shows that money alone is not the solution.
"If it were, there wouldn't be any problems left to solve."
"Next school year, we will spend $13 billion on our children -- $13 billion."
That represents a 62 percent increase over 1990 levels and a record of commitment to fair school funding that is second to none.
But being Michigan's number one budget priority does little good if our children still cannot read.
That is why our reading readiness initiative will be expanded to include summer school.
"The launch of the READY (Read, Educate and Develop Youth) program was successful."
The goal this year is to make this reading readiness kit available statewide to parents of young children.
The goal of our strategy -- for every child to be a good reader no later than the end of third grade.
We cannot stress the importance of this enough.
"If you cannot read, you will not succeed.Yes, reading is fundamental."
I am grateful to the many volunteers and mentors from all corners of Michigan who have answered the call to help our children read.
"Their efforts are fulfilling the dream of America's Promise, the volunteer campaign so ably led by General Colin Powell."
"So tonight, for putting volunteer power to work, helping our children in schools and communities, I salute our volunteers, our Michigan Community Service Commission and its chair and my favorite appointee, First Lady Michelle Engler!"
Another priority is expanding student and parent choice: By eliminating the cap on charter public schools.
By opening up public school choice statewide.
By guaranteeing that children who do not attend a traditional public school have access to extracurricular activities in their district of residence.
"And by allowing all students, regardless of where they live, access to Advanced Placement courses."
"Working with Michigan Virtual University, we can reward our best students and give them a head start on college!"
"When we take these steps -- creating the Michigan Merit Award, empowering mayors to fix their schools, helping children read and expanding school choice -- we move Michigan closer to our goal of becoming the ""Smart State"" -- first in the 21st century!"
"My fellow citizens, we care so deeply about our schools because we care so much about what our children do with their lives."
I passionately believe that all people have the right to choose the career that's right for them.
All young people should make that very personal choice based on their own dreams and the needs of their families.
"When they do choose, we must do our utmost to help them be successful."
"For those who choose college, it means continuing to fund the nation's best system of public higher education."
"And I am honored that Michigan State University President Peter McPherson, University of Michigan President Lee Bollinger, and Western Michigan University President Elson Floyd are here tonight."
"Next year, Michigan's impressive investment in our universities will be allocated based on a new funding formula."
This overdue reform will limit arbitrary and purely political funding decisions.
Formula funding that is fair and predictable will assure long term excellence.
"Whether you cheer for the Green and White, the Maize and Blue, or any other Michigan alma mater, we must all cheer together to make every school and every student a winner!"
"For those who choose to go directly into the workforce, a wide array of options must be accessible for career development, including on-the-job training, apprenticeships in a skilled trade, or high-tech training at a community college or university."
I believe there is great dignity in work.
That's what Michigan is all about.
"We are a state that makes things, and we are made up of hard-working people."
"Michigan was built by men and women who weren't afraid to roll up their sleeves, get their hands dirty and build things."
"In the century that awaits us, working harder won't be enough."
We will have to work smarter because the very nature of work is charging.
"Our competition is not standing still, and this governor won't wait for them to catch up."
We will keep Michigan workers in the fast lane to better jobs and bigger paychecks!
"So, let's take additional steps to ensure that Michigan workers are the best prepared and most highly skilled in the world."
I propose that we elevate the Office of Workforce Development -- which has been an integral part of the Michigan Jobs Commission -- to cabinet status.
The mission of the new Department of Career Development -- higher skills and higher incomes!
I propose that we modernize Economic Development Job Training by increasing the use of distance learning.
"Working with Michigan Virtual University, we can reach an additional 10,000 workers each year."
I propose enhancing services at the local level by establishing 100 one-stop Career Development Centers statewide.
"Our plan to create the new department, modernize job training, and provide one-stop career services is only part of our ""Smart-State"" strategy."
Equally important are actions to enhance Michigan's business climate that will keep us ahead of the competition and continue to diversify our economy.
"During the 1990's, Michigan's business climate advanced from one of the worst to one of the best."
The result -- we are number one in new factories and expansion projects.Number one -- over California.Number one -- over New York.Number one -- over Ohio.
Let me tell you -- Michigan is going to stay number one!What do we need to do?
"First, a ""Smart State"" cuts taxes."
Let's begin the new century with across-the-board cuts in Michigan's income tax.
Let's cut the rate from 4.4 to 3.9 percent and add billions to the $11 billion we have already saved taxpayers!
"Second, to protect the gains we have made, you should pass a constitutional amendment requiring a 60 percent vote of the legislature to raise the income tax, sales tax or single business tax."
We've worked hard to cut taxes.
Let's keep taxes down and keep Michigan moving forward!
"Third, I propose that we create the Michigan Economic Development Corporation."
"The Corporation will give us greater flexibility, continuity and focus, while allowing for the consolidation of all economic development functions."
"When it comes to helping Michigan companies create jobs or attracting new employers, we're already second to none."
"This, too, will help us stay number one!"
"When we fix our schools, train our workers and cut our taxes, Michigan prospers!"
We can take other steps to ensure that Michigan's prosperity continues and reaches even more people in the next century.
"For example, we will continue to fix our roads and bridges at a record pace because a modern, efficient transportation system is critical to our economy, tourism and trade."
"Last year, when Michigan spent more than $1 billion on road and bridge repair, we set a record."
"This year, when we spend $1.2 billion on projects ranging from the South Belt in west Michigan to I-75 and I-275 in southeast Michigan, we will set a new record!"
"As promised, we are fixing the roads, fixing them better and fixing them faster!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, ""Smart States"" are also safe states."
That's why we will be relentless in the fight against crime.
"Thanks in part to more than 300 anti-crime bills passed by the legislature, crime in Michigan is at a 30-year low!"
Another reason crime is down -- the number of prisoners is up.
"And for this, I make no apologies."
"In Michigan, if you do the crime, you will do the time!"
"Crime prevention remains a priority, especially crimes against women and children."
"For example, in the crusade against domestic violence, Michigan is a national leader."
"Tonight, let's again lead the way."
Let's allow those who have been threatened with violence to petition the court for personal warning devices.
"With this technology, if there is an approaching threat, the victim and the police are notified instantly."
"Let's put abusers and stalkers on notice -- in Michigan, we are putting technology to work to prevent crime and protect our people!"
"To prevent juvenile crime, we should require that juveniles, when arrested for serious crimes, be fingerprinted and that their fingerprints be kept on file."
This tough step will discourage teen offenders from becoming career crooks!
I also propose the expansion of drug testing for juvenile offenders.
"Because when we get them off drugs and keep them off drugs, we keep them out of trouble!"
Juveniles who threaten the safety of students and teachers in schools will also be held accountable.
I renew my call for legislative approval of tough measures requiring the immediate expulsion of kids who assault teachers or other school staff.
The bottom line is this -- assault a teacher and you're gone!
The next thing we should do -- end the wasteful and frivolous practice of allowing prisoners an automatic right of appeal when their parole is denied.
"Convicts should be serving their time, not wasting our time!"
"Beyond schools, jobs and safety, ""Smart States"" take steps to enhance the quality of life."
"A critical influence on our quality of life is the quality of our environment, and we can improve it by encouraging environmental stewardship and the conservation of land, especially wetlands and farmland."
"In this regard, Senator Spencer Abraham deserves our thanks for his leadership in chairing the successful Clean Michigan Initiative -- an important part of my strategy to protect the environment and improve our quality of life."
"Michigan's air, land and water are cleaner today than at any time since record-keeping began more than a generation ago."
"Michigan stands tall as the guardian of the Great Lakes, and our record as a pioneer in environmental policy, based on sound science, is strong."
"As we work together to implement Clean Michigan, save farmland and reduce urban sprawl, we will make sure that Michigan's rich legacy of natural beauty and well-managed resources is preserved for future generations."
"My friends, a ""Smart State"" must be a clean state!"
"Just as a cleaner environment improves our quality of life, so too have countless medical advances."
But with those advances come new threats to individual privacy.
"Last year, I directed the Michigan Commission on Genetic Privacy and Progress to look at the use of private, personal, medical information and tell us what needs to be done to prevent its misuse."
"Their report will be public next week, and their recommendations should receive prompt action."
"Specifically, genetic testing must not be a precondition for obtaining health insurance."
And genetic testing must not be allowed as a precondition of employment.
Threats to privacy aren't the only challenges medical advances present to us and our families.
For example -- the difficult and heart-wrenching questions that families confront regarding the end of life.
I am proud that Michigan overwhelmingly rejected assisted suicide and affirmed the sanctity and dignity of all human life.
"In all we do, we must respect life."
"That said, many families -- our own families -- often face very difficult decisions."
Michigan has always been a compassionate state.
"From pain management to hospice care, we've acted to ease the burden on patients and their families."
"So to build on what we've done, I will appoint a Commission on End-of-Life Care."
Another area where Michigan's compassion has really made a difference is our strategy to strengthen families.
"Thanks to our decisions and the efforts of our communities, the number of people on welfare has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years."
"However, for some families, there remains a particularly difficult barrier to overcome -- drugs."
"Tonight, I ask again for approval of Operation Zero Tolerance."
This pilot project fights drug abuse.
All too often drug abuse is child abuse.
"By testing and treating drug abusers, we save lives and end dependency."
I urge your strong and swift support to pass this legislation now!
"We will also help children by expanding our Parental Responsibility Initiative to identify deadbeat parents, locate them and put them to work."
"Tonight, I have talked about a wide range of initiatives to cut taxes, improve our schools, make college more affordable, prepare people for success, create more opportunity, clean our environment, fight crime, help our children and strengthen our families."
I have focused on the future and spotlighted what we need to do.
"Our agenda is bold, broad and ambitious."
"It must be -- if we are to reach our goal of being a ""Smart State"" and if the legacy of liberty of which I spoke in my Inaugural Address is to be handed on to future generations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, God's handprint has blessed us with rich peninsulas."
Michigan will forever be known as the Great Lakes State.
"Four of the Great Lakes lap our shores, giving Michigan more coastline than the entire eastern seaboard."
That explains why Michigan is home to more lighthouses than any other state.
"Throughout our history, those lighthouses have cast their glow, helping to chart courses and save lives, always pointing the way home to safe harbor."
"As we enter a new session, a new century, a new millennium, my friends, we are on course."
Michigan's light is burning bright.
"Let's make our state shine even brighter, so that people everywhere will know that Michigan is THE state of Great Lakes, Great Schools, and Great Opportunities."
"When we do, Michigan truly will be first in the 21st Century."
"Thank you, good night, and God bless the great state of Michigan."
