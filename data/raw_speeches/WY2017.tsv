Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
(Applause.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for the wonderful greeting.
It’s not going to get any better than that.
Mr. President, Mr.
Speakers, members of the 64th Legislature, Secretary Murray, Auditor Cloud, Treasurer Gordon, Superintendent Balow, Chief Justice Burke, Members of the judiciary, members of the military, veterans, citizens of Wyoming.
Carol, Mary, Pete, glad to have you here as always.
As you probably noticed walking in, I am quickly becoming the shortest member of my family, and there’s nothing to be done it, but I’m always proud to have my family here.
Good morning to all of you.
I’m privileged to give my seventh State of the State address to the joint session of this new legislature, Wyoming’s 64th.
There are new leaders and new faces.
There’s a new energy that comes with adding new people to the mix.
To first time legislators, welcome.
You have joined a very distinguished group.
To returning legislators, welcome back.
As always, I look forward to working with this body in important work ahead.
State of the State.
On the State of the State I’m pleased to report that though we face challenging times, Wyoming remains strong.
Our state has prepared well for times of lower revenue, and our citizens continue to do great things, contributing to Wyoming’s strength and success.
Preparation for leaner times has two hallmarks, conservative budgeting and savings.
Past and present leaders have wisely done both.
Regarding savings, the State has $1.59 billion in the LSRA, the rainy day fund, and nearly $7.4 billion in the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund.
These funds have grown substantially during my time in office.
The rainy day fund, of course, is named for rainy days like those we’ve been experiencing these last couple of years.
It’s raining.
This fund has allowed us to get through a rough revenue patch, and can do so in the future.
Last session our spending from the rainy day fund helped smooth our budget and provide necessary services.
Questions, however, remain about the rainy day fund and its use, continue to exist.
I continue to believe we need additional guidelines on the use of this fund that would set parameters and provide our citizens of local governments a better opportunity to refine their budgets by knowing what is the rainy day fund for, and when will it be used.
Certainly we know that cautious use of some rainy day funds allow to us to fill the revenue gap in tough financial times.
For example, the ’17-18 biennium, this body tapped $221 million from the LSRA for use, leaving the fund healthy.
This was important to do because it’s continued to make Wyoming strong.
Because we see, despite the energy bust, which is going on for about three years now, Wyoming has kept high national rankings.
These are indicative of our State’s strength.
For example, Wyoming has maintained a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor’s.
In 2016, Wyoming has ranked the best state to start a business, the best state to make a living, and the best state to retire.
That’s in 2016, that difficult year that we just went through.
Wyoming continues to be ranked No.
1 among states by the Tax Foundation, for having the most business friendly tax climate.
(Applause.
In 2016, Wyoming was ranked first in Mountain Region for Workforce Development, and was also rated third for new business start-up activity, and sixth best state for business.
So despite being the most difficult budget year in my time in office, Wyoming stayed proactive and forward-looking: The Capitol construction project; with the important work of renovating and modernizing our state facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital, the Wyoming Life Resource Center, and the Wyoming Veterans Home.
We had groundbreaking at the University of Wyoming for the McMurry High Altitude Performance Center, and the Engineering Education and Research building last fall, and groundbreaking with Integrative Test Centers last spring.
At the University of Wyoming, in addition to new facilities start, we opened the Enzi STEM facility in March 2016, and the High Bay Research Facility is opening soon.
We have had incredible opportunities with the wealth created by our many businesses and great citizens.
We are grateful for so many partnerships.
We’re grateful for the partnerships that we have with Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapahoe Tribes.
We are partners and friends to each other, and look forward to continued good relations with the Tribes.
Sergio Maldonado, tribal liaison for the Northern Arapahoe Tribe is here today.
Leslie Shakespeare, with the Eastern Shoshone is also here.
Leslie has kindly agreed to continue as tribal liaison in an informal capacity until a new person is chosen.
We appreciate the work of those liaisons, which strengthen ties and improve communication.
If the Tribal members, all Tribal members that are here and liaisons would please stand, we would like to welcome you to the State of the State.
(Applause.
None of the prosperity we have enjoyed will be fully realized without the safety and security provided by our law enforcement and first responders.
We see nationally sometimes law enforcement getting painted with a broad brush, and they are often vilified.
In Wyoming we don’t do that.
We continue to be extremely proud of our law enforcement and first responders.
It’s time Wyoming, as we continually do, to once again, thank law enforcement, first responders for the incredible work they do.
(Applause.
We know firsthand we would not have a Wyoming quality of life without men and woman who serve in the Guard.
Our Guard helps fight the global war on terrorism, and assists here at home with firefighting, flood control, and storm damage.
Last year our Guard performed air medical evacuation missions in Afghanistan, helped fight wildfires in Idaho, filled sandbags in Saratoga and Hudson, helped prevent a fire in the Big Horn Mountains from becoming a much larger wildfire.
That’s just a few of the things the Guard did in one year.
General Luke Reiner, the Adjutant General of Wyoming is here today representing the Guard.
Thank you, General.
We are grateful for your service and the service of all Guard members.
General, please stand so you may be recognized.
(Applause.
Luke, it’s great to have you here, and as always, you look very sharp in that uniform, so thank you for being here.
As we celebrate our Guard members, we remain grateful for all military members, our veterans, and those who serve our veterans.
I’ve asked today for two to distinguished veterans to be here with us; Lee Alley and Larry Barttelbort.
Lee is vice chairman of the Wyoming Veterans Commission and Larry is the director.
Both, unfortunately, have indicated they’re going to be retiring early in 2017.
Lee is a Wyoming native and graduate of the University of Wyoming.
In 1967 he went to Vietnam as an Army lieutenant, and served as reconnaissance platoon leader for an infantry battalion.
His list of military decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Soldiers Medal, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, two Air Medals, two Purple Hearts, and a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.
He was nominated for the nation’s highest award, the Medal of Honor.
Upon his return from Vietnam, the Casper Star hailed Lee as Wyoming’s Audi Murphy, alluding to the highly decorated World War II vet.
Lee was instrumental in reshaping the Wyoming Veterans Commission so that it serves all generations of our veterans.
His leadership ensured the Commission’s work was professional and relevant.
He previously served as chairman of the Commission and served ten years in all.
Lee’s book, Back From War - a Quest of Life After Death, has been used by countless vets and their families to better understand how they can adjust to life after serving in combat.
Colonel Barttelbort took the oath of an Army ROTC scholarship cadet in 1975, his military and government service spanning more than 40 years, began then.
He served on active duty with the 4th Infantry Division for five years, was selected for the Active Guard and Reserve Program for the Wyoming Army Guard in 1985, and retired in 2000.
He was re-called to active duty in 2000, serving as Wyoming Army guard Chief of Staff, and was responsible for airport security augmentation for ten Wyoming airports following the 911 attacks.
He retired from the Army again in 2004, became director of Wyoming Veterans Commission in 2007, and since then has worked tirelessly to improve benefits, services, and programs for Wyoming veterans.
In my budget message, I discuss one benefit, the veteran’s tuition waiver, which suffered from last year’s session cuts.
To address the issue in the interim, I moved money to fix the program during that interim period but it’s just a short-term fix.
I favor a long-term commitment to those who joined the Guard on the promise of tuition assistance was in place.
I also favor some form of support for new recruits.
I hope you’ll favorably consider these matters.
We -- and I mean our state -- nearly 50,000 vets and all those who work with the Commission, including me, will miss Larry and Lee.
Our communities, our state, our country are better places because of men like Larry and Lee, who step of up to serve in the US military and keep on serving in a civilian capacity.
With their work and the outstanding work of this Wyoming legislature Wyoming is recognized as one of the very best states for veterans to retire in.
Larry, Lee, we couldn’t thank you enough for all the service you provided to state and country.
Please stand so we could recognize both of you.
Thank you.
(Applause.
In Wyoming we are enriched by our great ag, tourism, and, of course, minerals.
We know for those industries to remain strong we need the University of Wyoming to be great.
A great university starts with great leadership.
And we have a great leader in Laurie Nichols, UW’s 26th president.
She started in May 2016 when Dick McGinity retired.
She came at a challenging time.
It’s hard enough to be a university president let alone during the time of budget cuts.
It’s great to have her at the helm.
We are proud of the new facilities at the University of Wyoming which will strengthen Wyoming’s representation as a leader in education, technology and innovation.
We are proud of the academic research and athletic achievements at UW.
Speaking of which, how about that Cowboy football team?
(Applause.
They gave us some great memories, and we appreciate that.
And, Laurie, we thank you for your leadership at a critical time.
Thank you for being here today.
Please stand so we may recognize you and the University of Wyoming.
(Applause.
We are keeping the competitive edge, and that’s a wise thing to do at all times, especially during a time of constrained revenue.
In 2016 we pressed on with efforts to promote and diversify our economy.
I’ll give a few examples.
We are now and shall always be a proud ag state.
Ag puts food on the table.
Ag provides great open spaces.
We have great wildlife in Wyoming.
We have great respect for the Second Amendment.
And when you combine all these assets together, it’s no surprise that hunting, firearms and shooting sports are part of Wyoming’s history and heritage.
We want to keep these traditions and pass them on to future generations, and that we want to share an enjoyment of sporting life with others.
With this in mind I announce a new initiative for public shooting ranges and shooting competitions, including the first annual Magpul-sponsored Governor’s Match scheduled for this summer.
I charged state parks with convening an Outdoor Recreation Task Force.
The Task force held its first meeting in December, and will provide recommendations to me this year on how to further expand the growing outdoor industry.
Thanks to Atlas Carbon, Tungsten, HiViz, and McGinley Orthopedics going gangbusters.
2016 was a year of expansion for manufacturing.
The Wyoming firearms industry, an important component of manufacturing, continues to grow.
Our world class companies manufacture handguns, precision rifles, silencers, optic, sights, and other firearm accessories.
Take, for example, Magpul, recently selected by the United States Marines as the exclusive supplier of magazines for combat use.
Isn’t that incredible news for a Wyoming company to supply our US Marines?
(Applause.
And while there were doubters about our recruitment of firearm companies, I believe now, more than ever, we can continue to build a robust firearms industry in Wyoming.
You are all aware of my focus on the technology sector.
With the Unified Network, annual broadband and global technology summits, recruiting efforts and natural advantages like the cool climate, energy availability, technology continues to emerge as a viable economic sector.
I truly believe it can be our fourth largest sector, and we must continue to build upon it.
Last spring with more than three-quarters of the initiatives in the original energy strategy complete, we updated the strategy to include 11 new initiatives.
Amongst those initiatives we’re working to make changes in the Endangered Species Act.
The Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973.
Since 1973, all the species listed, a little over just one percent have ever been delisted.
It needs help.
As chairman of the Western Governors Association, my initiative was to get the western states on board to change and improve the Endangered Species Act, and as you can be aware, all western states don’t have the same politics as Wyoming has.
While we worked together with outdoor groups, with environmental groups, we put together a proposal, and I’m pleased to say in June of last year Western Governors voted unanimously for improvements to the Endangered Species Act.
We’re now going to take it to the National Governors Association, and we’re going to take it to Congress.
It’s time to make improvements to the Endangered Species Act.
(Applause.
To continue with the energy strategy, with review of reclamation rules, carbon innovation, and I greatly appreciate the legislature’s support of the energy strategy, which has helped with implementation.
We not only want to be the energy state in terms of production, we want to be the energy state in terms of innovation, and we can be.
The carbon initiative looks at building an industry around CO2.
This means investing in advanced energy technologies and innovation.
Integrated Test Center under construction now at the Dry Fork Station in Gillette is part of this effort.
The relationships we fostered with XPrize has now put together a $10 million prize for the team that can figure out to how to capture that CO2 but not only capture it but use it to make it a useful product.
This has not only brought attention in Wyoming to how we help further coal, but around the country.
The governor of Montana is asking his legislature to help participate with us.
We have companies coming to Wyoming to learn what they can do to participate in it.
It’s very exciting.
It’s very important to have that innovation here in Wyoming.
An industrial park project for value-added energy products, that is uses beyond extraction, is also a part of the carbon initiative.
In 2014, this body appropriated $15 million for the ITC, and provided seed money to begin an energy-related industrial park project.
Projects like these not only help Wyoming’s number one industry, minerals, especially coal, they foster diversification.
The ITC is well on its way and we need to pursue the industrial park project this year.
I hope you’ll consider a bill that provides for further implementation of the initiatives and energy strategy.
We are proud Wyoming is the energy state, and we are the energy state.
In 2016, as part of that, we continued to implement that which goes with energy, which is water.
The State Water Strategy was issued two years ago.
The Water Strategy contains ten initiatives.
One of the initiatives is the 10 in 10 project, which seeks to build ten new reservoirs in ten years.
While I know it’s ambitious, we’ve come a long ways, and I’m pleased to say the Omnibus Water Bill you’ll consider this session has four of these 10 in 10 projects; the Big Sandy Reservoir Enlargement in Sublette and Sweetwater Counties, the Big Piney Reservoir in Sublette County, Alkali Creek Reservoir in Big Horn County, the Leavitt Reservoir Expansion in Big Horn County.
Water projects like these are funded separately from government operations, education, and school construction and maintenance.
These funds generally come from Water Account III, which is accumulated over the years and has the funding available.
Together these projects would add over 31,000 acre feet of storage of our most precious natural resource, and that is water.
Water is key to economic development, ag production and more, and water development must remain a priority.
In 2016, the executive branch, we continue to streamline our rules and tighten our belts.
For example, we put uniform rules in place for public record requests.
This is in addition to my request two years ago to have all agencies reduce their rules by 30 percent.
We have fewer rules, we are spending less, and we’re down positions from fiscal year 2011, my first year in office.
We have in Wyoming bucked the trend of so many governments that only grow.
While being careful with the budget is critical, we can never forget we are more than counters of dollars.
We are here for the citizens of Wyoming.
To be sure, we must remain aware of our inmate population, our disabled population, the health care we are providing or not providing to the citizens of Wyoming, and always we think of our families, and the next generation, our children.
In September I sponsored the Governor’s Symposium on Suicide Prevention in Casper.
It’s important to talk about suicide and ways to reduce suicide.
People who are hurting need help, and we need to look for ways how we can better provide it.
This will now become an annual symposium.
In November I announced the ENDOW initiative at the business forum.
This is a long-term planning effort for economic diversification.
The acronym stands for Economically Needed Diversification Options for Wyoming.
I seek $2.5 million for this initiative in my supplemental budget proposal.
I’ll continue to work for economic diversification, building on our successes during my last two years in office.
However, as a state we need a plan that goes beyond one governor’s time in office.
We need a 20-year plan.
And we do not diversify to displace energy, tourism, ag.
We diversify to increase our economic opportunities in those areas as well as to expand our economic base overall.
As we diversify our industries, we must look at how we tax our industries.
Diversification and a broad-based fair tax structure are required to stabilize our economy, our revenue.
We need to diversify not only to stabilize and grow our revenue but equally important to that is we need to diversify to benefit our young people.
We need to provide more options for our young people, to give them as many reasons as possible to say yes to staying in Wyoming as we can.
As we look at our population we know that in any given time period, we lose between about 60 percent of the age group of age 18 to 25.
Our future will never be as bright as it can be if we don’t do all we can to keep young people home, home in Wyoming.
The energy -(Applause.
The energy bust and the revenue fallout reminds us why the ENDOW initiative is imperative.
I want to thank President Bebout and Speaker Harshman for their leadership on moving ENDOW forward.
In December we got some great news.
The National Park Service completed the purchase of the 640 acre Antelope Flats parcel of state trust land located in Grand Teton National Park for $46 million.
23 million came from the federal government and 23 million came from over 5,000 private donations to the Grand Teton National Park Foundation.
I thank all the donors who made this happen, the legislature for its support, and, of course, we remember the late US Senator Craig Thomas who got the ball rolling on this.
(Applause.
Not only is this good news for the park, it’s good news for education funding, at a time when we need good news.
The money has been deposited in a common school trust funds to you support Wyoming schools.
The parcel was generating no revenue for Wyoming.
We were getting zero dollars.
Income generated in the common school trust fund account varies but it’s expected that these funds will generate more than a million dollars annually for our schools.
The funds are also available for the Board of Land Commissioners to acquire land assets held by the federal government, if we choose to do so.
The State of Wyoming currently owns one remaining 640 acre parcel in the park, the Kelly parcel in the Gros Ventre Road.
It’s valued at $46 million.
We are making money on that parcel.
That $46 million asset is bringing in a whopping, about $2,000 a year.
The legislative authorization for the direct sale of the Kelly parcel expired December 31st, 2016.
Moving forward, the Board of Land Commissioners has authority to exchange the parcel or sell it at auction to the highest builder.
Additional authorization, however, from the legislature will be required for a direct sale to the National Park Service, and this is something I ask you to consider.
The bottom line is, even during these tough times we accomplished a lot in 2016.
Wyoming remains strong heading into this new year.
And it’s a big achievement.
We’re keeping our state strong during a difficult period.
There’s a lot of credit to go around.
Certainly the legislature, the University of Wyoming, our amazing community colleges, our state agencies, and in our communities, our businesses.
As I’ve said before, Wyoming people are Wyoming’s greatest asset.
The individuals I recognize today are examples of people all around Wyoming who contribute to our State’s strength, and we thank all of them.
Now I turn to the budget.
In June 2016, I asked the agencies to implement $250 million in cuts from the ’17-18 budget.
This was in response to a larger revenue shortfall forecast in the spring.
These were difficult and necessary cuts.
My supplemental budget proposal carries these cuts forward, making them permanent.
With my cuts and the legislature’s cuts last session, the executive branch operating budget, which was 2.9 billion in 2010, is now a little over 2.5 billion.
It’s down, not up.
This reflects conservative disciplined budgeting, the type of budgeting Wyoming is known for and proud of.
State government has shrunk, it has not grown.
The legislature last session voted for $67.7 million in cuts, which I know you found difficult to make.
I made three-and-a-half times that amount of cuts in June, which too was very difficult.
The belt-tightening begun in 2013 has continued, and I make only five general fund requests of you this session.
Five million for local governments.
We have to continue to support our local governments.
2.5 million for ENDOW, which I have spoken about.
$500,000 for the UW Science initiative.
475,000 for the UW strategic enrollment program.
And $160,000 for Tribal liaisons.
These are one-time items, although the ENDOW initiative is envisioned for 20 years, and I hope it will continue to be funded beyond this budget cycle.
My general fund supplemental requests total just over $8.6 million, and the funds are available.
For new legislators, to put it in perspective, supplemental budgets in recent history have exceeded $300 million.
My budget message explains the importance of these five requests, but today, for example, I’ll talk about one of them, UW Science Initiative.
As I mentioned earlier, we have been investing in STEM University of Wyoming.
These efforts are critical.
We need to continue to invest in the science initiative, thus the supplemental request.
Because we value education, and this legislature values education so strongly, every year I’ve highlighted the great talent we have with our teachers by recognizing the Teacher of the Year.
This year we’re recognizing Ryan Fuhrman, who is Wyoming 2017 Teacher of the Year.
He grew up in Casper.
He was inspired by his junior high lab teacher to become a teacher.
He graduated magna cum laude from Black Hills University in Spearfish, and received a master’s degree out east.
A 15-year teaching veteran, Ryan started teaching in Wyoming in 2008, and has taught science at Sheridan Junior High since 2012.
In addition to teaching science, he’s a VEX robotic instructor, Camp sySTEMatic Counselor and Organizer, Science Kids board member, and assistant basketball coach.
Continued commitment to the science initiative at UW will help prepare more science teachers like Ryan.
Ryan, we’re very proud of you.
Please stand so we may recognize your extraordinary work as a teacher.
(Applause.
We know, as we consider the difficult work ahead on education, that we not only have great teachers and great school districts, we also, in Wyoming, have great, great students.
Logan Jensen is a junior at University of Wyoming from Greybull, Wyoming.
I first met Logan when he was elected official for Boys State, and I spent a day with him.
Logan is double majoring in physics and astronomy at the University of Wyoming.
I did not know that was possible.
I’m not even sure it’s legal.
This is an amazing thing.
He has taken advantage of almost all Wyoming offers an undergrad.
As a freshman he went with the faculty to UW’s infrared telescope, learning to operate a major scientific facility, and acquiring the skills to analyze digital images.
As a sophomore he led a study at the atmospheric stability over the Mount Jelm Observatory sites.
He will participate in next summer’s total solar eclipse, research and outreach.
And for those who are not familiar, we are going to have -- Wyoming is going to be the place for the total eclipse.
This is, if you’re not aware, a big deal.
And I have here in my notes, in your own words from Diane Shober, make sure everybody knows how valuable this is to tourism.
It’s a big deal.
August 21st.
He also serves as a counselor to junior high youth at the ExxonMobile Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp at UW.
He’s done, as a junior, what many Ph.
D. students would long to do.
He is a beneficiary of UW Science Initiative.
We want to encourage more students like Logan to take advantage of the UW Science Initiative.
Logan, please stand.
Congratulations on the extraordinary work you have already done.
(Applause.
In this supplemental budget year I request contingent funding of 21 million for Title 25 services, 19.2 million to address the repair of the Wyoming State Penitentiary, if necessary, and 104.2 million for the budget reserve account.
This contingent funding would come LSRA.
I also request the legislature authorize bonding to cover capital construction costs for the Wyoming State Penitentiary at Rawlins.
After talking to some of you, I know some of you do not favor that.
But let me just say this.
Whether you want to do bonding or you want to take it as savings, it will not go away by not addressing the funding.
I believe the prison should stay in Rawlins, not just by the constitution, but by what it means to that community.
I also believe that we need to be prepared to, whether it is a fix or a rebuild, we need to have that addressed this session, including where the funding would come from.
My budget proposal is bare bones and balanced.
We have nearly 1.6 billion sitting in the rainy day fund.
It appears without a diversion that I’ve asked for from all of you, the rainy day fund will grow in this session.
It’s a hard message for the people of Wyoming, as we’ve made in excess of $300 million cuts since last session and we would continue to grow the rainy day fund, and goes again to the question, what is the rainy day fund for, and what are you going to use it for.
So I have asked for some of that money to be diverted for my budget, and to not go to the rainy day fund during a time when it is raining.
Now I think of, and I know many of you do, think about the general fund budget as a separate budget from education.
And I think that’s an appropriate way it look at it.
The education budget is different.
The School Foundation Program can fund K through 12 school operations through this biennium but not beyond.
Beginning with the ’19-20 budget, the shortfall in the School Foundation Account is projected to be 1.5 billion over the next six years.
School facilities, maintenance funding must also be addressed because it’s not included in that 1.5 billion.
I ask now, as I’ve asked before, that we work together to discuss solutions that include the public, teachers, school boards, and parents in this discussion.
We recognize that one week to submit comments to this body regarding the subcommittee’s December 28th very thoughtful education funding white paper is not enough.
I believe just short of 600 comments in about a week were provided.
We have to make tough decisions this session, but to solve the issue completely we need to have a broader public discussion.
The many public comments we received in one week underscore the need for the public’s participation on this issue.
Starting the discussion on education, I point out the wonderful report of Superintendent Balow, we were just rated seventh best in the country.
The other six are on the east coast.
We don’t even know where the east coast is from Wyoming.
We are proud of that, and we want to continue to be strong on education.
I point out Wyoming should be proud of how it supported education.
By any measure, Wyoming has placed the highest value on education.
To illustrate this point, between executive, judicial, and legislative branches, the general fund standard government operating budget has decreased since 2011.
In fact, today the government operations standard budget is about $200 million less per biennium than the total block grant to school districts.
$200 million less.
Simply stated, the standard budget for all government operations is less than we’re spending on K through 12 education.
This doesn’t even include major maintenance, doesn’t include school Cap Con construction.
In 2016, together we cut the executive branch operating by 317 million.
In total, the cuts to the executive branch were 11 percent, when you combine legislative cuts during the 2016 session and my budget reductions last June.
In contrast, the school operation budget has been growing.
It was 1.3 billion annually in 2011 when I took office.
It is nearly 1.5 billion now, six years later.
While student enrollment has increased 12 percent since ’05-06 School Foundation Funding has increased over 91 percent.
And now we see a projected shortfall of 1.5 billion over the next six years.
This is a big problem.
It is a fiscal crisis.
It is a big problem that requires very big, very difficult choices.
As I did last year, I again ask that we have a task force for Speaker Harshman’s committee to be formed with full participation of Wyoming stakeholders, to address school funding, because a year has gone by and things have not gotten better.
We cannot wait another year to act.
At a minimum we should be planning for reductions.
But there is the broader discussion that we should continue to have about funding and revenue.
And it is my hope that participation with all of you and the public, that we can at least, by the start of next session, have a plan that addresses both the cuts and the funding.
I do want to mention a non-budget measure from last session, the Safe 2 Tell program authorized by legislation by Senator Coe and Speaker Harshman.
I’m pleased to report that this program, which is an anonymous tip line, is already making a difference in preventing suicide and improving school safety.
This session I know you’ll be considering numerous bills.
I’ll follow them as they move through the legislative process.
I can tell you here at the start a few things that I am interested in.
I support, in concept, the sales tax collection from remote sellers, establishment of a legislative framework for ENDOW, improving ignition interlock laws, providing a mechanism to continue the energy and water strategies.
In what has sure been a challenging financial market, we’re getting poor investment returns.
There’s just no other way to look at it.
It’s a challenge in this financial market.
But we’re also not doing well compared to other states.
And yet the State of Wyoming pays in excess of $70 million a year in management fees and consulting fees.
This has to change.
It has to change now more than ever, when we are budget-constrained.
The Treasurer has worked hard in his office to make some suggestions for the legislature.
I’ve asked you to consider those suggestions because the Treasurer, like me, recognizes we want better returns and we want to spend less money getting those returns.
Until we can get a broader, more comprehensive tax structure, I ask you to consider continuing the Manufacturing Tax Exemption, which is sunsetting.
It’s important for the businesses that are here, it’s important for some of the businesses we are trying to recruit now.
We are looking to the change of administration in DC in the coming weeks, and we hope that will provide an opportunity for Wyoming to become stronger.
I’m heartened about the prospect of fewer federal regulations, and pro-growth economic policies.
I’m hopeful the new administration will see the benefits of what states like Wyoming has done in responsibly developing their resources.
I’m hopeful that more authority will be given to the states with respect to natural resources and other areas.
And as we face some difficult budget times, we know that we are, in fact, better suited to address the problem than we ever have been in the past.
I also am confident that this group, the legislature, is a group to deal with these difficult issues.
But as always, it really isn’t just about the numbers and the dollars, or a single issue.
We cannot lose the forest in the trees.
This session, as every session, we remain obligated to do what is best, not for ourselves, political parties, but for the citizens of wonderful Wyoming.
What a privilege we have to have that as our duty.
What privilege it is to have that opportunity, to have our job, to serve the citizens of Wyoming without regard to political party, without regard to any single issue, but how do we do better for the citizens of Wyoming?
I thank the legislature as I always do.
We are successful in this state for a number of reasons, but a prime reason is we have a citizen legislature.
You men and woman who give up time and leave your homes and families and businesses to come.
It’s an extraordinary thing.
It keeps Wyoming strong.
But as always, we take time today to say, we know we’re blessed to live in this state.
We say to the citizens of Wyoming, we will continue to work hard for you.
We say, may God to continue to bless Wyoming and the United States and all her people.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.
