SENTENCES
"I am pleased to come before you this morning and report that the Stateof the State of Georgia -- host of the greatest Olympics ever, home ofthe heavy-weight champion of the world and the newest member of the BaseballHall of Fame -- the State of the State of Georgia is great!"
We are now the tenth largest state in the nation.
We are a place wherepeople and businesses want to be.
"In the six years since January 1991, Georgia's population has grownby 13.5 percent."
"We have been the 7th fastest growing state by percentage,and by number of people, only Texas, California and Florida added more."
"Even more significant, the number of jobs in Georgia grew by 22 percentduring the same time."
"And Georgia's unemployment rate has been droppingover the past five years to its lowest annual average in more than twodecades.The pay's getting better, too."
"In 1995, our per capita income reached94 percent of the national average."
And our total personal income has increasedby 37 percent since 1991.
"Atlanta's growth has been especially strong, and the Olympics were animportant contributing factor."
"For the past several years, we were focusedon the 1996 Olympics as Georgia's chance for international attention andname recognition."
"And I can stand here today and say that the 1996 Olympics here in Georgiawere indeed the largest peacetime event in world history -- bigger thanthe prior two Olympics combined, bigger than the Games will be in the year2000."
And six of every ten people on the planet watched them on television.Our name is known.
Our state public safety personnel performed magnificently last summer.
"It was a superb team effort, and our officers showed the world just howgreat Georgia is."
"To paraphrase Churchill, it was their finest hour."
"Dozens of Georgia communities hosted teams, and the venues around thestate were outstanding."
Many of our citizens continue to be in personalcontact with athletes around the world.
"I personally met with hundredsof foreign dignitaries and business executives who came to Atlanta in conjunctionwith the Olympics, and we will feel the positive effects on our growinginternational trade and investment for many years to come."
"But, even as the Olympics were dominating the news of the day, Georgiawas quietly garnering attention throughout the nation and around the worldfor another achievement that some might have thought as unlikely as hostingthe Olympics -- education."
"Barely had the athletes left town and the banners been taken down, whenCNN turned its attention to a ""Future Watch"" special on our pre-kindergartenprogram."
"And they will feature it again in about a week on a program called""Parenting Today."
"Peter Jennings, on the ABC Evening News, devoted a five-minute ""Solutions""segment to it."
"And it was also featured on the ""Jim Lehrer Report""on PBS."
A dozen states as far away as Alaska and Hawaii have requested information.
Connecticut flew our program director up there to get a firsthand report.
"England and Ireland want to know more, and Zimbabwe is sending a representativehere this month to see it in action."
"The HOPE Scholarship Program was generating a high level of amazementand interest around the nation, even before President Clinton set out toemulate it on the national level."
Our P-16 Council is also getting a lot of national attention.
"At lastcount, more than 15 other university systems were trying to figure outhow to copy it."
"Imitation, they say, is the most sincere form of flattery."
And it isgreat for Georgia to be in a position where others want to imitate oureducation programs.But there is more to be done.
"And that is why we are here, at the startof a new legislative session."
"I am now in the late autumn of my political career, my administrationas Governor, and my life."
"It is a time when one reflects and thinks seriouslyabout what is really important, what really matters."
"In my own life, it is my family."
Today Shirley and I are celebratingour 43rd wedding anniversary.
"She has been the motor and mainspring ofmy life, the wind beneath my wings."
We are looking forward to the arrival of our second great-grandchildnext month.
"Then in April, our oldest grandson will turn 15 and want tostart driving."
"As I have been preparing for this, my seventh session as Governor, I'vebeen thinking a lot about what's important in the State of Georgia."
AndI come back to the same thing -- the family.
The family is the fundamental building block of our communities andour society.
"It is what holds us together and makes us strong, stable andproductive."
"And the unifying theme of the bills and budget I will bring to you inthe coming days, more than anything else, is to protect and promote Georgia'sfamilies."
"My grandson Justin, who is coming up on 15, loves cars."
"We goto the Atlanta 500 together, and his heros are Dale Earnhart and Bill Elliott."
"He is going to need a little ""tough love"" as he learns to driveand gets out on the highway."
It terrifies me to realize that one out of every 24 Georgia teenagerswas involved in a vehicle crash last year.
179 of those teenagers werekilled.
They'll never have a chance to get a HOPE Scholarship or thrill theirparents with a grandchild.They're dead.
Vehicle crashes are the leadingcause of death between the ages of 16 and 20.
So I will bring you the Young Driver's Safety Act to provide a gradualprocess by which young drivers earn full driving privileges.
"It would worklike this: At age 15, Justin's age, those who pass a written test and a visiontest can get a learner's permit."
"They can only drive if a person over age21 is beside them in the front seat, and all passengers are wearing seatbelts."
And there would be zero tolerance for alcohol in these young drivers.
"If that 15-year-old then has had no wrecks, no moving violations andno illegal use of alcohol or drugs by the time they turn 16, they may takea road test."
"And if they pass it, they get an intermediate permit."
"The driver with an intermediate permit could drive alone except betweenthe hours of one and six A. M. when they would have to be with an adultover age 21, going to work or in a medical emergency."
"All passengers would be required to wear seat belts at all times, andthere would continue to be zero tolerance for alcohol."
"Then at the age of 18, if their permit has not been suspended withinthe prior 12 months, and if they've had no wrecks, no moving violationsand no illegal use of alcohol or drugs within the prior 12 months -- thenthey receive a regular driver's license, still with zero alcohol toleranceuntil they reach age 21."
This bill sends a clear message to teenagers andtheir parents that driving is not a right.
It's a privilege that has tobe earned though responsible behavior.
"And I'd also like to point out that if we fail to adopt zero alcoholtolerance for young drivers by October of 1998, we will lose $16 millionof our federal highway funds the first year, increasing to $32 millionthe second year."
"As Governor, I have talked with many families whose loved ones werekilled by drunk drivers."
"parents who have lost an infant or a teenager,children who have lost a father or mother."
I've talked with the family of a police officer who was run over andkilled while on duty.
"Anyone who spends five minutes with any of these families, will understandwhy, for the seventh year in a row, I will bring you a bill to strengthenour DUI laws."
"Like last year, this DUI bill has four parts: First, the nolo plea."
"Incredible as it may sound, a nolo plea, which is nothing but a way toget around admitting guilt, clears your criminal record and gets your suspendedlicense back."
"If anyone other than a lawyer or a drunk can explain that to me, I'dlike to hear it."
And so would the general public.
"I am proposing that even with a nolo plea, your driver's license remainssuspended for the time provided by law."
"Second, provide for mandatory jail time -- at least 24 hours for thefirst offense and 72 hours for the second."
So many things I've brought to you over the years have come from mylong life of hard knocks and experience.
"I know what it's like to grow up in a single-parent family, becauseI did."
"I know it's possible to learn some ""corps"" values at bootcamp, because I did."
"I know what it's like to want to go to college and get a special scholarshipthat makes it possible, because the GI Bill did it for me."
"I also know what it's like to spend the night in jail on a drunk charge,because I've done that, too."
"So again, this old voice of experience who'sbeen there and done that, says: Put those drunks in jail and let them seewhat it's like; let them discover how miserable and degrading it is, andhow good that sunlight feels and how good that fresh air smells the nextmorning."
"Third, once again I propose we impound the license plates from the vehiclesof habitual offenders, since taking their driver's licenses isn't enoughto keep these dangerous, unguided missiles off the road."
"And fourth, privatizing the use of interlock ignition systems as a conditionof probation."
"These systems that keep someone who's drunk from starting up that unguidedmissile, have proved effective in other states, but are getting littleuse in Georgia because cities and counties are required to buy the equipment."
Innocent Georgians are being slaughtered on our highways; Georgia familiesare being cruelly ripped apart by drunk driving.
Georgia's DUI laws arestill nowhere near tough enough.
"With every ounce of my being, I beg you to put aside partisan interests,give up the defense of legal loopholes, and give Georgia's citizens theprotection they need and deserve."
Probably the best news for our families today is that 3.6 million Georgianshave jobs.
more than at any time in our history.
"We've seen phenomenal job growth -- an average of over 2,000 new jobsa week since 1990."
Last year industrial investments totaling nearly $6.3billion were announced in Georgia.
"They will create over 33,000 jobs."
"According to Forbes Magazine, Georgia has created more new jobs thanall but two other states."
"And a recent report by Dun & Bradstreet said that Georgia is ""thebiggest winner (ranked #1) in the battle to retain companies and jobs."
"Dun & Bradstreet attributes much of our success to Georgia's ""moderatetax rate."
"And during this administration, we have cut taxes for Georgia'sfamilies."
First giving them a break on their state income tax and now removingthe state sales tax from groceries.
"The third cent will come off in October,and the final cent next year."
"There's no question that our Department of Industry, Trade and Tourismhas done a significant job in this expanding economic development."
"Butlike all of us, they can always do better."
So we are going to reorganize the Department to continue improving coordinationamong our economic development initiatives.
"The state was a partner in the public-private Operation Legacy, whichused the leverage of the Olympics to bring CEOs from more than 400 companiesaround the nation to Georgia."
"So far, 18 new locations have resulted fromthis effort, creating over 3,000 jobs."
"I want to continue Operation Legacy as a public-private partnershipunder auspices of a stronger state industry marketing effort in the Departmentof Industry, Trade and Tourism."
I also propose that we bring the Governor's Development Council underthe Industry and Trade umbrella in a new Strategic Planning and ResearchDivision.
"And we will continue to encourage regional planning initiatives, witha $2.5 million grant program that supports multi-county, regional collaborationfor economic development."
"Despite all of this economic growth and all the new jobs, we still havetoo many Georgia families that are unemployed and need help."
And we aregoing to do that with a completely new welfare program that began two weeksago on January 1st.
"It is called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,or TANF."
"We are going to stop the decades-old practice of simply putting checksin the mail, month after month, year after year, in some cases generationafter generation."
Cash assistance in Georgia will be limited to a totalof four years.
"Instead, we are going to focus on two things: One, helping people getthe skills for the jobs they need to become self-sufficient and supporttheir families."
"And two, pregnancy prevention, especially among teenagers."
We are going to provide assistance with transportation and other neededsupport services to help recipients find and hold down jobs.
"We are going to require teen mothers to stay in school, and we willprovide child care for their babies."
And we are going to target adult recipientsunder age 26 with assistance to complete their GED.
"Parents will be requiredto take an active role in their children's education, making sure theyattend school and participating in parent-teacher conferences."
"It's a tough approach, but it is also a hopeful approach."
"We're sayingto those on welfare, we have faith that you can work and be self-sufficientjust like the rest of us."
We began restructuring our welfare program in Georgia some time agoto put more emphasis on work.
"I reported to you in last year's State ofthe State, for example, that the Macon DFACS office at that time was steeringmore than a third of its welfare applicants into jobs rather than ontothe welfare rolls."
"Our WorkFirst program has already reduced our welfare rolls by 20,000families over the past four years, saving taxpayers $52 million."
So we'realready farther along in this respect than many other states.
"In addition to helping people get the skills they need for productiveemployment, the second major thrust of TANF is pregnancy prevention, especiallyamong teenagers."
It takes only a few broad brush strokes to paint a picture that explainswhy the problem of teen pregnancy has grown so disturbing.
And it goesto the heart of the family.
"The common denominator you find among pregnant teens, rich or poor,from all different socio-economic categories, is the absence of a fatherin that teenager's home."
"Second, even if we could wave a magic wand and render every single teenagemale in Georgia sterile, it would reduce teen pregnancy by only 25 percent."
"Third, fully 60 percent of the girls who have had sex before age 15say they were pressured into it against their will."
The old traditional stereotype of two kids getting carried away in thebackseat of a car no longer holds.
Too many of our teenage girls are emotionally vulnerable because theyhave no father at home.
And also -- and this is very important -- theyare being exploited by men in their 20s and 30s.
"In general, the youngerthe girl, the greater the age gap between her and the father of her baby."
That is why I worked so hard last year to pass a law requiring a minimumprison sentence of 10 years for anyone who is 21 or older and has sexualrelations with a child under age 16.
It's also why we are working so hard to identify fathers and force themto support their children.
"This year, we are going to approach the problem of teen pregnancy fromanother angle as we reform Georgia's welfare program."
"The plain fact is we have a lot of sexually active teenagers out therewho, if they become pregnant, will go on the welfare rolls."
"And once they get on the rolls, unwed teenage mothers tend to stay onthe rolls significantly longer than average."
Pregnancy prevention is welfareprevention.It is that simple.
TANF includes five initiatives to combat teen pregnancy.
"The first isto create 15 clinics in non-traditional sites, like DFACS offices, substanceabuse centers and even housing projects."
They will be concentrated in communities that have a combination ofhigh teen pregnancy rates and high welfare caseloads.
I also want to expand the family planning services in county healthdepartments.
And we are going to fund more outreach and mentoring workersat the county level.
"Finally, we are going to expand two successful, community-based pregnancyprevention programs."
"One is targeted at teenage males, and it is alreadyin operation in 15 Georgia communities."
"The other is Grady Hospital's abstinence-based program for teens called""Postponing Sexual Involvement."
These changes are the beginning of a whole new era of welfare in Georgia.
"It is a long overdue change, and it is an opportunity to make an historicturn-around."
ending welfare as we know it and creating a program thatworks to the benefit of its recipients and the satisfaction of the taxpayerswho foot the bill for it.
"As Shirley and I celebrate our 43rd anniversary today, I think of themany Georgia families who are not as fortunate, because they are beingtorn apart by domestic violence -- violence of spouse against spouse, parentagainst child, child against parent."
"It happens more than 15,000 times a year in Georgia."
Last year therewere over 30 fatalities.
"Far too often judges let them off with a slap on the wrist for inflictingserious injury -- broken bones, even permanent disabilities."
And I'm tiredof allowing people to regard their own family as possessions that theycan knock around as they wish in the privacy of their home.
"Last year we passed our very first criminal family violence law, recognizing""family violence battery"" as a misdemeanor."
"That was a step inthe right direction, but it was only a baby step toward where we reallyneed to be."
"I have another bill to recognize the family violence crimes of assault,aggravated assault and aggravated battery, in addition to the ""familyviolence battery"" we created last year."
"And it provides for stronger penalties, requiring mandatory jail timeranging from five days to five years, depending on the severity of theact and the number of prior offenses."
You always hear the argument that mandatory minimum sentences interferewith a judge's discretion.
And that may be true for some things.
But family violence is so volatile and unpredictable.
"And I believewe need a mandatory minimum sentence, even if it is only a short time forthe first offense, to get the attention of those who abuse their own families."
"Family violence is one of the factors that has brought nearly 17,000foster children into state custody."
"And the pressure is unrelenting tofind more foster care placements, often with little advance notice."
"But the urgency of placing children coming into foster care, often keepsus from giving enough attention to getting children out of foster careas they become eligible for adoption."
"As a result, too many children are stuck in foster care for too long."
"And too many of them end up being ""aged out"" of the foster-caresystem as teenagers."
"They are left to navigate life completely on their own with no homeor family, and many of them end up in shelters for the homeless."
"As a short-term response, foster care is absolutely essential, and weare deeply grateful for the families who provide it."
But it should notend up being any human being's entire childhood.
That's why we've created a separate Office of Adoptions within the Departmentof Human Resources.
"And on Thursday, I am going to tell you about several initiatives topromote adoption and assist foster children who are ""aged out""of the system."
"As the Millers look ahead to a new arrival next month, we are praying,like all families, for a healthy baby."
"But, like all families, if thereis a problem, we want to find out about it as quickly as possible."
"So I'm asking you to expand my Children First Program, which we startedwith your help in 1992 to screen newborn babies."
Right now we are screeningabout a third of our newborns for problems that put their health and developmentat risk.
I want to screen every baby born in this state to ensure that we identifyat birth every at-risk child.
And then we will track them from birth untilthey enter pre-kindergarten at age four.
"Medical research clearly shows that those first three years, when alot of crucial developments occur, have a long-lasting impact on a child'shealth, well-being and ability to learn."
"Identifying at-risk newborns, and then tracking them to make sure theyget the special services they need during those critical early years, isa wise and humane investment."
"It will enable our children to grow up healthy and ready for school,and it will save us a lot of money in the coming years."
"One of the most pressing concerns of Georgia's families today, and oneof the most important responsibilities of state government, is public safety."
"And the first thing I want to say on this subject is that I hope youwill immediately pass a bill that I will bring to you to fix the ""twostrikes"" law."
Last year legislation was passed that unintentionally removed rape andaggravated sodomy from the list of violent crimes under the two strikeslaw.This bill will restore them.
"Georgia has been among the states who have led the way in enacting legislationon child support collection, sex offender notification and victim compensation."
Widespread action by the states is now being reflected by new federallaws in these three areas.
"And I will bring you bills to bring Georgia'sstate laws into conformity with federal law, providing for seamless enforcement."
"Above and beyond the legal requirements for public notification aboutsex offenders, I want to announce today that Georgia is establishing astate-of-the-art, automated calling center for registered victims of allkinds of crimes."
"It is called VINE, which stands for Victim Information and NotificationEveryday."
"Whenever an offender is released, the system will automatically callall of the registered victims of that inmate."
"And it works the other direction, too."
Any registered victim can callin at any time from any phone and get a status report on their offender.
It gives Georgia's victims a chance to be pro-active in protecting themselvesand their families.
"Illegal drugs continue to be a significant problem for too many of ourfamilies, and I believe we need to become as creative in our approachesas drug dealers are if we are to stem the tide."
So I'm going to ask you to pass a drug dealer liability law.
I wantGeorgians who are harmed by illegal drugs to be able to sue the drug dealerswho lit the fuse that resulted in the damage.
"And not only the person who actually used the drugs, but also theirparents, spouses or children, their employer and even the medical facilitieswho treat them."
I believe all of them ought to be able to sue drug dealers to recovertheir costs.
"This could be a start to shifting the huge cost of the damagecaused by illegal drugs, back onto the dealers who are profiting from thesale of the stuff."
"The other side of the coin from passing public safety laws, is dealingwith the convicted offenders."
And I welcome this opportunity to say a fewwords about that.
"If there is any one clear message from the citizens of Georgia, it isthat they do not want us to coddle criminals, and the Miller Administrationis not going to."
This is a governor who believes that the root cause ofcrime is.criminals.
"Today, you can enter a Georgia prison, and you will find the inmatesclean-shaven and orderly, their cells and dormitories Spartan, and thefacilities neat."
And you will not find a cleaner place in the state.
I'veseen floors you could eat off of.
But today it would have to be a coldsandwich at lunch.
Regular searches have sent a clear message to inmates that weapons andcontraband simply will not be tolerated.
"And if you want to tear up property,you have to pay for it."
We have also ended the process of letting criminalsout of prison to go have a good time just because a holiday has come along.
The Medical College of Georgia is going to begin providing inmate medicalcare.
Their sophisticated telemedicine system will save taxpayers the costof unnecessary transportation of prisoners.
And the money we spend for inmate health care will stay in Georgia andbe reinvested in medical education.
"Taxpayers have benefitted from a law, which you passed last year, toassess inmates a $5 fee to see a doctor or dentist."
"If it's an emergency, or they are indigent, or the prison staff ordersthem to go, then it's free."
This has really cut back on the number of thoseclaiming to be sick to avoid work detail.
"Our prison inmates rise early in the morning, and walk four and a-halfmiles."
Then they work eight-hour days.
And in the evening they may work on their GED.
"For several years, someprisons have had teachers on the staff, some costing up to $82,000 a year,working during the regular day."
"However, as I just pointed out, under this administration every able-bodiedinmate is out working all day."
And very few inmates are around to taketheir classes.
So we are reorganizing our prison education program to contract withteachers to provide evening classes.
And we are going to augment theirefforts with distance learning technology.
"This change will greatly expand the number of inmates who receive basiceducation, and at the same time save $8 million for our taxpayers."
We have also privatized the constitutionally mandated responsibilityto provide legal services to indigent inmates.
"In doing so, we have savedtaxpayers $600,000 a year with no reduction in the quality of legal services."
What is wrong with all that I have just described?I don't think anythingis.
"Unfortunately, there are a number of folks -- some of them well-meaning-- who want us to treat criminals like victims, and victims like criminals."
"The truth of the matter is that despite more inmates than ever before,escapes are down, use of force to restrain violent prisoners is down, andcomplaints by inmates about prison staff are down."
"That's the bottom line, and Wayne Garner is responsible."
"I support him;I'll bet your constituents support him, and you should support him, too."
"There's always room for improvement, and I welcome your help."
"I won'toppose the 100 percent or 85 percent, or whatever you want to do to makethe sentences longer."
But if you're looking for a criminal justice issue -- make sure youlook in both directions.
"For violent crimes in this state, there is lessthan a 50 percent arrest rate."
"And for property crimes, like burglary androbbery, the arrest rate is only about 15 percent!"
"Folks, you can't have a prisoner to parole if there's never even beenan arrest."
"Until this problem is dealt with, there will continue to be places inGeorgia where one cannot walk or live without fear."
And the voters at thecoffee clatches and Rotary clubs will still be complaining.
Georgians also care about the natural environment.
And I want to mentiontwo issues briefly.
"First, I am going to bring you a bill to create a CoastalZone Management Program."
Georgia is the only ocean-front state that doesnot participate in this 24-year-old program.
"It would bring additional federal funding into our state to help protectour natural resources, and it would give us more authority to review andapprove federal activity along our coast."
"No matter what anybody tells you, it will not add any new restrictionsor bureaucratic layers, but instead would require greater cooperation amongexisting agencies and programs."
"Then second, an issue we have been dealing with for several years --the allocation of water among Georgia, Alabama and Florida."
"We three states have been in formal negotiations for some time now,and we have come up with two interstate water compacts: One between Alabama and Georgia for the Coosa, Tallapoosa and AlabamaRiver Basins, and one among Georgia, Alabama and Florida for the Chattahoochee,Flint and Apalachicola River Basins."
These compacts are now before the state legislatures of each of thesestates for ratification.
"And since we do not have a compact to providefor interstate conference committees, they can only be adopted withoutchange."
I believe these compacts are fair to all the states involved andprotect Georgia's interests.
And I join with the Speaker and LieutenantGovernor in asking for your support and early passage of these compacts.
"I would also like to thank Speaker Newt Gingrich publicly, as I haveprivately, for his crucial help with these compacts."
"What he did Saturdaywas incredible, and I'm deeply grateful."
Our Attorney General Mike Bowers has also been of tremendous help.
Thisis truly a bi-partisan effort.
I know I've been talking a long time.
And I've only mentioned brieflythe issue I care most about -- the passion of the Miller Administration-- education.
It comes back to the family again.
"Parents are their children's first teachers, and we must never forgetit."
And then our schools become partners with parents in helping our childrengrow and learn.
"One of my goals for education, as you already know, is to make Georgia'steacher salaries competitive on the national market, so that we can hireand keep the best teachers possible for our kids."
I made a commitment to provide a six percent salary increase for Georgia'steachers every year for four consecutive years.
My goal was to put Georgia'steacher salaries at the top of the region and at the national average.
"With your help, we have already enacted the first two increases."
"Weare passing other states, and we are on track to achieve our goal to beable to compete nationally for outstanding teachers."
"And with your support,we are going to continue."
I'm going to talk more about my goals for education and how the budgetmoves us toward them on Thursday.
"So until then, I'll close by saying that I want and need your help."
"For some of you, we've been together a long time."
I've enjoyed the ridewith you; it's been a good one.
And we'll soon be getting off this oldhighway up at the next exit ramp.
"You've probably already found out, as I have, that as life shortens,misgivings magnify."
"Let's not miss this opportunity, and later be sorrywe did."
"For those of you whose exit is way on up the road, but who have workedwith me for a few sessions, I want to say thank you."
We've made an enormousdifference.
We've made some landmark decisions.
And we now have the opportunityto further that progress.
"For those of you who are just starting out, I want to draw your attentionto the bipartisanship that has accompanied some of our most significantaccomplishments in recent years."
"I want very much for that spirit to continue, and I will bend over backwardsto do my part."
Jean Monnet once said that all people of great achievement are ambitious.
"But the key question is whether they are ambitious to be, or ambitiousto do."
"My friends, please join me in being ambitious to do."
