SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of the Idaho Supreme Court, elected state officials, members of the First Regular Session of the 54th Idaho Legislature: I am now halfway through my first term as your Governor."
I come to you with only one sense of disappointment.
Term limits apparently will let me serve only six more years.
"It is a rare privilege to act as chief executive of the best of all states -- and it is a pleasure to work with a conscientious Legislature, one that meets the challenges of changing times without undue expansion of regulations and taxes."
This is my third State of the State message to you.
"It is a report on improvements in state government over the past couple of years, and my assessment of our future agenda."
I am pleased to report that many of the initiatives we undertook at the start of my tenure have now produced measurable improvement: We have stopped the growth of state government.
We have dealt firmly with juvenile crime.
We have taken the lead on welfare and Medicaid reform.
"Perhaps most importantly, my administration, with your help, has changed state government from master to servant."
"Without condoning violations of our laws and regulations, we have adopted a helpful attitude throughout our agencies."
"We are more interested in facilitating the creation of jobs, rather than imposing fines and shutting down productive activities."
"We want Idahoans to make money, put some down in their pockets and be able to pay their taxes which fund our schools."
"This attitude of partnership with the public is noteworthy because it comes at a time when state government is leaner than it was two years ago -- by about 300 full time employees, according to the Personnel Commission -- and when agency heads have operated under holdbacks for two years in a row.We are also less regulatory."
"In the 18 months prior to my assumption of this office, state government churned out 1,270 pages of new rules and regulations."
"In the 24 months since I became Governor, we have produced only 63 percent that many."
The theme of making more efficient use of tax money is also being advanced in one of the state's most critical responsibilities -- providing educational opportunities to our citizens.
Our future sits in our classrooms and we must be sure our education efforts are effective.
"Idaho's hard-working State Board of Education has abandoned the turf protection of the past for an active effort to improve all education, from public schools through post-doctoral programs, and to rescue those who slip through the cracks along the way."
"During this session, you will review the Board's proposed K-12 rules."
"At your direction, the board dissected these rules, and reduced them from 1,500 to 380 while increasing local control."
"With your approval of these new rules, school districts should be expected to respond, where possible, by reducing administration and putting education dollars to work in the classrooms."
"You will also be asked to give the Board additional authority to accept credits from non-traditional sources, such as the Western Governors University and other distance learning vehicles."
"This change will protect program quality while meeting the rapidly changing needs of our students, traditional and non-traditional alike."
Other innovations should also be examined.
I applaud the efforts of President Hoover to re-examine the tenure system.
"It may be that the practice of granting professors -- or teachers at any level -- the permanence or security of tenure should be carefully considered for modification, or even removal."
"Competition, which works in nearly every other job experience, may enhance our education efforts."
Idaho leads in school technology.
"Thanks to a legislative appropriation, the first ten Technology Incentive Grants totaling $10.4 million have been awarded to faculty members for projects intended to increase the rate of student learning, boost productivity, and control costs."
"About 250 classroom teachers have been trained through Idaho's PBS in how to incorporate technology into day-to-day lessons, and each of them, in turn, is committed to training another 10 colleagues."
Test scores in Idaho's public schools are rising.
"Our emphasis on setting goals and testing to ensure that the goals are being met, is paying off."
Idaho's schools are good and getting better.
"Yet, Idaho's school drop-out rate continues to frustrate us."
"Last year you adopted legislation, which I allowed to become law without my signature, to tie the driving privilege to high school attendance.It's been rarely used."
"If school districts don't want to take advantage of this questionable law, we should repeal it."
The debate over school facilities continues to grow.
I applaud those who are using their ingenuity by lengthening school days and extending classes year 'round.
We should provide flexibility for this sort of innovation.
"If we can get more use of our facilities without adding new bricks, we have found more education money."
"Those kinds of economies are ever more important, given the increased financial requirements of public safety and correctional costs."
One place we have not been able to reduce has been in the operation of juvenile corrections.
"The juvenile corrections system, which you created, is succeeding even better than we expected -- though starting a new department and function of state government from ground zero is no easy task."
We are trying to establish the right mix of compassion and correctional punishment to deal with these young but often vicious and hardened criminals.
"Before we created this department, a hodgepodge of uneven treatment existed."
"We have stopped, forever, the practice of shuffling the records of young hoodlums around to the point that they could be returned to prey upon the public with only a slap on the wrist."
Now we are evaluating offenders more accurately for appropriate treatment with the cooperation of the counties.
We are assuring that those who can be handled locally will not be thrust upon the state.
"And for those who need a higher level of care, we now have secure facilities, reducing the need to send juveniles out of state."
I see a faint glimmer of hope that both adult and juvenile crime may be abating.
"That is where the answer lies -- not in prisons, and not in rehabilitation, but rather in a resumption by society, and by the individual, of collective proper behavior which used to be our norm."
"Until we change this social behavior, we will continue to see millions and millions spent on courts, police, and prisons -- dollars that would be far better spent on education or in a return to our taxpayers."
Medicaid and welfare are also driving forces in government.
Last year I appointed an advisory council to look at Medicaid and suggest reforms to this $1 million-per-day program.
I need more time to study their far-reaching report and its financial implications before I bring proposals to you.
"Yet, we can all agree on the general direction: a well-run Medicaid program that focuses our limited resources on the most vulnerable among us and that aggressively pursues those who would defraud or abuse this program."
Last year also saw the start of our welfare reform efforts.
"Here, too, I started with an advisory council to look at a system this country had nurtured and fattened for more than 40 years that did not decrease dependence on assistance from government, but rather fostered it."
"Our failed system tore at the institution of marriage, encouraged teen pregnancy, and far too often created a cycle of dependence that spanned several generations."
My welfare reform committee gave you sound recommendations and you adopted most of them.
One of these laws will cause a lot of folks to lose their licenses if they do not pay their child support or honor their visitation agreements.
"In effect January 1st, this law will allow us a better chance to collect a substantial portion of the estimated $109 million of child support currently in arrears.It's working already."
"Meantime, Congress has decided to withhold food stamps and Medicaid from legal aliens.I understand the reasoning."
No one should come to this country depending on their new government to provide welfare.
"Nevertheless, I do not think it is in our best interest to deny basic medical services to anyone."
"The result would be an expensive overload of hospital emergency rooms, as well as an increase in serious illness and death."
"Nor do I believe we should ask our schools to shut the door on any child, be they alien or citizen."
"There can be no benefit to Idaho society to have within its borders children declared to be pariahs -- uneducated, unhealthy, and shunned."
We do not want to make Idaho an enclave for alien benefits.
Nor do we want to abandon human beings to the trash heap.
I want your help in striking a balance.
Both state and federal law changes reflect a fundamental belief that welfare should be temporary and all able-bodied adults should be moved into the workforce.
"Here in Idaho, we are changing welfare from a haven of hopelessness to a leg up toward a bright, productive future."
Planning these changes was the easy part.The execution is harder.
We are now ready to work on our real objective: to move people from government assistance to jobs and careers so that they can provide for themselves and their families.
Health and Welfare will work hand in hand with the Department of Labor as we focus on this long-term goal.
We have now successfully combined the Departments of Labor and Employment into one dynamic venture which serves both labor and employers better.
It is also doing its job for less money.
We asked business to come up with a self-funded mechanism for training workers.
"They came through by setting aside a small percentage of unemployment taxes, creating a $3 million resource for training displaced or beginning workers."
"Labor, Commerce, and Vocational Education, working together, have already proved this to be a valuable tool for encouraging Idaho businesses to expand, for recruiting new businesses to our state, and for retraining employees."
Scores of new jobs have come about mainly because of this effort.
"American Microsystems, Inc. of Pocatello, Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies of Idaho Falls, and Coldwater Creek of Sandpoint were the first to qualify."
"Between them, they're creating more than 200 new jobs.You made this possible."
Director Madsen has been an effective manager for the Department of Labor.
"In keeping with my Hispanic Initiative, and through a federal grant, the Department of Labor is increasing its efforts to place seasonal workers into full-time employment."
Idle workers were given jobs to clean up flood debris in North Idaho and to mitigate damages to the Boise Foothills from last summer's catastrophic fire.
All of this has been done without sacrificing customer satisfaction.
Let me read part of an unsolicited letter of thanks from a Boise man looking for work through East Boise Job Service: .
"I found the entire staff from the placement desk and information desk, to the gentleman in charge of the computers in the resource center, to the ladies who helped me with computer problems, were positive, professional, and very helpful."
I wish to commend the change in attitude that I found.
"Now, a quick look at what some of the other agencies and programs have done since we last met: The State Liquor Dispensary has had more than its fair share of publicity lately."
"When I took office, the agency was in a state of turmoil, but with the help of key legislators we have turned this around."
"The satisfaction of distributors, consumers, and dispensary personnel has increased about 1,000 percent."
"Furthermore, we have instilled businesslike, competitive practices in the awarding of franchises, warehousing, freighting, and all of the other applicable functions."
"The department has also reorganized its middle management structure, saving about $100,000 annually."
"Key legislators, especially Senators Bunderson, Ipsen, and Ingram, have helped re-write and improve the dispensary rules."
"Under my administration the Departments of Finance and Insurance have combined much of their operations, resulting in substantial savings to the taxpayers."
"The Finance Department responded to more than 4,300 consumer and investor complaints and inquiries during the past year."
Their enforcement actions allowed Idaho investors to take advantage of $3.7 million in rescission offers.
The bilkers were stopped and Idahoans saved their money.
The Department of Insurance worked tirelessly to reduce the cost of Workers' Compensation Insurance.
"Our already low rates will drop an average of five and a half percent this year, an important reduction at a time when farm employers will be required to insure their workers."
You were wise to bring the agricultural industry under the workers' compensation law as of January 1st of this year.
"In most cases, the cost of converting to such coverage has been minimal, while the protection afforded to employers has been substantially increased."
I have asked the State Insurance Fund to go out of its way to make this an easy transition.
"However, I want to go further and allow a short ""grace"" period, without penalty, for new agricultural customers to comply."
"The Department of Commerce, now under the leadership of new director Tom Arnold -- (not Roseanne's ex-husband), continues to respond to the needs of Idaho's private sector by building effective partnerships with Idaho businesses and communities and by getting the word out that Idaho is a great place to live, to vacation, and to do business."
"I want to thank all of you who, in an election year, stepped forward to support a badly needed gas tax increase for the Idaho Transportation Department -- our roads are vital to commerce."
"In the last year, the department resurfaced nearly 1,100 lane miles of state highways and they have 18 new resurfacing projects on the books for this year."
We broke ground on the state's first private-public partnership project with the Micron interchange.The Nampa-Caldwell Blvd.
"expansion is finally under way, thanks to scores of property owners who donated 136 parcels of right-of-way."
"The increased revenues were magnified by the department's aggressive reduction of bureaucracy, putting another $2.7 million of salary savings into resurfacing projects."
"This department has been outstanding in its response to flooding, slides, and other weather damage, both last spring and during the recent destructive storms."
"We are looking for maximum effectiveness of the tax dollar in all other areas, too."
"We privatized medical services at the Department of Correction, resulting in big savings and we're exploring more opportunities to lower costs through additional privatization."
The department is fiscally and physically holding the federal government responsible for convicted foreign nationals.
Most are being deported or paid for by the feds.
"When your clients are hardened criminals, you will have some lapses or errors."
"Yet, our prison system has dealt with staggering growth in a responsible manner and is striving to improve, despite harsh criticisms from some of the media."
The State Land Board faces challenging decisions which come from changing times.
State land holdings have provided us a continuing source of badly needed funds for schools and other essential services.
"At my suggestion, the land board has appointed a task force to look at ways to enhance our earning power."
This group will recommend an investment strategy to maximize the return to our state coffers.
We shouldn't be satisfied with investment returns of two percent below comparable funds.
"All land board members -- J. D. Williams, Pete Cenarrusa, Anne Fox, Al Lance, and I -- have worked together in a bipartisan manner to manage these state resources.Our important work continues.It's time-consuming."
"They don't call it a ""bored"" for nothing!"
State government is also soliciting and listening to citizen ideas for cost savings and efficiencies.
"Barbara Cole of Boise wrote to the Department of Administration suggesting that we could save money by changing from bleached to unbleached paper towels in our public restrooms -- that idea is now saving $4,000 annually in the Capitol Mall area alone (This is a clean government.We wash our hands a lot)."
"Pam Ahrens continues to economize her department's services -- postal automation resulted in a savings of $509,000 over the past 18 months; and a new intra-lata phone contract will save an estimated $850,000 annually."
We're also proud of our military.
Idaho's National Guard is an important part of our country's defense and continues to win first place honors in competitions with other states.
"Here at home, our citizen soldiers, working with the Bureau of Disaster Services, are the backbone of our disaster and relief efforts."
Last year I told you that our bank account could be impacted up to $30 million by north Idaho floods.
"Today I can to report that the total state cost will not exceed $5 million and, even at that, we were able to pick up with state funding nearly all of the matches required of local governments."
We have endured further catastrophic events during the past two weeks.
"State teams are working with local officials and citizens to mitigate the floods, slides, and avalanches."
We will likely receive substantial federal assistance.
"In any case, we'll spare no effort to take care of our people, restore their homes and property, and get the roads open."
Participants in disaster relief at all levels deserve our gratitude.
Idahoans pull together in times of need.
"We're lucky to live in a state that is home to someone like Vernon Baker of St. Maries, who will soon receive the Congressional Medal of Honor -- and who is the only living black American to receive such a high commendation from World War II."
We're lucky to have people like Gene Harris and Lionel Hampton and other highly talented individuals who attract such strong philanthropic support from the public.
"We're lucky to live in a state that has the ethnic and cultural diversity of Idaho's Native American tribes and its Hispanic population, even though these populations require specific attention from time to time."
My administration has done a lot of work with minorities.
"Yet, I want no one to be under the false impression that I am advocating special treatment for anyone at the expense of the majority."
My interest in these groups is based on the apparent fact that they are not reaching their full economic potential -- and that is detrimental to all Idahoans.
My Hispanic Initiative concentrates on the deleterious effects of an abnormally high dropout rate and on the need for young Hispanics to master the English language and train themselves for good-paying jobs.
The response from Hispanics has been highly encouraging.
This is a group that is on the move.
"Rather than spending more money on governmental services, we're working with Hispanics throughout the state to make sure that existing services augment their self-improvement."
The tribal issue is a different matter.
The economic issues are the same and we have made some small progress.
What complicates this dialogue is the unique nature of sovereignty.
I have succeeded beyond my highest expectations in opening a constructive conversation with the tribes.
Tribal leaders have been cooperative and have respectfully considered my views.
"Yet, many areas such as natural resource protection, police authority, employment conditions, gambling, and a myriad of others, inevitably bump into the thorny issue of sovereignty."
This is not based upon unreasonable whims of the tribes.
"Existing treaties have the full force of the law, yet have sometimes been ignored and occasionally affect non-Indians adversely."
We must firmly protect the rights of all of Idaho's citizens while leaving irreconcilable issues to the courts.
"We are, indeed, lucky to live in Idaho."
We have abundant wildlife resources.
"In some categories, fish and game harvests are improving."
"Duck, geese, and pheasant populations are increasing, although we could use a lot more pheasants and chukkars."
Even steelhead fishing is on an upturn.
"But this priceless resource is in grave danger, and recovery of anadromous fish is a high priority."
I credit the former Fish and Game Commission for spotlighting the need for a more aggressive recovery effort.
"But, talking about the problem is not enough."
"The new commission and I have focused more on actually implementing scientifically valid, sustainable recovery plans."
The contributions of all the board members are important.
My early call for the resignations of the commissioners was ill-conceived.
Such authority for immediate removal should probably be stricken from the books.
"However, while the previous commission has done well in some areas, it needed improvements in its fiscal management."
Violations of bidding laws and questionable financial arrangements with private organizations have come to light.
The budgeting effort has not been diligent nor effective.
We do not need more pickups than employees.
"I am confident that the new director, Steve Mealey, will tackle these problems."
"Nevertheless, the commission must take charge, rather than leaving these decisions solely to the director and to career middle management."
The commissioners must also see that the agency speaks with one voice regarding the obligation of Idaho water and the unwanted return of grizzly bears to parts of our state.
"Let us turn for a few minutes to some of the important, though complex, challenges which lie ahead."
Telephone deregulation is upon us.
"We can't go back again, nor should we."
We must write enabling legislation with emphasis on reliable service and reasonable rates.
"But, we cannot afford to prolong the process -- we must rise to the challenge."
I look forward to your recommendations in this regard.
"Similarly, Idaho's low-cost power has been a mainstay of our economy."
"With electrical deregulation looming before us, we must jealously guard our electrical generating system, our reasonable rates, and our historic reliability."
A legislative study committee following this session could lay the foundation for discussion of this crucial matter.
Idaho is blessed with a stable and balanced tax structure -- we should be careful to preserve it.
"However, there are some areas of fairness that we should examine."
"Last session, Representative Mader advocated doing away with the ""marriage penalty"" in our income tax system."
It had a hefty price tag -- $10 million -- and the bill was not adopted.But the idea was sound.
Why should this state penalize and discourage the institution of marriage by levying a punitive tax rate on married couples?
"I propose we do away with the marriage penalty, but adjust the rates so that the revenue impact is neutral -- this can only add to the already attractive benefits of entering into marriage."
I'll discuss property and other general taxes in my budget message.
"During 1996, proper attention has been focused on housing authorities and low-income housing programs in our state."
A lack of coordination seems evident.
It's possible that some of our citizens are missing the opportunity to avail themselves of affordable shelter simply because of red tape.
"I am issuing an executive order creating a committee of interested parties, including legislators, to study the different facets of affordable housing issues ranging from funding and incentives to oversight and accountability."
This panel will report its findings before next session.
No business nor institution is stronger than its employees.
Idaho's state employees are among the best.
"My department heads share my philosophy of lean, efficient government, and therefore we have eliminated some positions."
The remaining staff has picked up additional duties and is serving the people well.
"Still, I believe our present personnel system has become badly tattered by the passage of time."
I was the chief author of the so-called Hay Plan.
That plan replaced a spoils system which rewarded favorites.
The Hay Plan provides for equal pay for equal jobs.
I also wrote or worked on our present policies for grievance procedures for real or imagined employee complaints.
"But, our grievance system, designed to settle complaints simply and informally, has now made it practically impossible to dismiss a poor employee."
"Often, when an administrator offers the first negative evaluation, the employee hires a lawyer and files suit."
We are paralyzed in trying to weed out the few sub-standard employees.
It is bad for morale -- it is bad for taxpayers.
Private business is shrinking middle management and gaining productivity from new technologies.We can do neither very well.
Our hiring procedures are so cumbersome that many good applicants bypass us for a private job.
It is essential and fitting that most of our employees are protected from political whims through a classified system.
"Yet, we owe it to taxpayers -- and we owe it to our employees -- to reward efficiency and to rid ourselves of non-producers."
"I have appointed a study committee under retired General Darrell Manning, which includes legislators."
I urge you to promptly act on the committee's recommendations.
We've all talked about Proposition 3 for too long.It's time to move on.
I thank the voters for sustaining me.
I thank legislators of both parties who provided critical support for my position.
Now I ask supporters and detractors alike to help me monitor the agreement.We will tolerate no deviation.
We're ahead of schedule now -- we must never fall behind.
This whole question has had a strong positive national impact.
"With our state efforts and the full participation of our Congressional Delegation, we have forced this country to focus on the need for a clear policy for nuclear waste disposal."
Another area which has involved federal-state coordination is anadromous fish recovery.
Our ocean-going salmon and steelhead are an invaluable asset.
These magnificent creatures are an important part of our history and a crucial element in our economy.
I have emphasized the need for sound scientific research ever since I have been in office.
That plea has been partially answered by the release of several scientific studies to the Northwest Power Planning Council.
"However, the need for further objective evaluations has not lessened."
We need to continue spending money on tagging and tracking.
Most reports recommend a gradually declining use of barging and more emphasis on a natural river ecosystem.I accept that wisdom.
"The governors of Montana, Oregon, Washington and I are working to devise a plan for more closely conforming to natural river flows."
"Such a plan will have to recognize some essential Idaho concerns: First, we cannot furnish large amounts of water in dry years if we don't have it."
"Second, the Port of Lewiston must be allowed to operate."
"Third, Dworshak Reservoir cannot be drained below a usable level during the summer."
"And fourth, Idaho electrical consumers cannot be required to pay an exorbitant rate."
We will do our part -- and we expect others to do the same.
Aluminum companies and other large downstream electrical consumers must participate in any overall plan of sacrifice for salmon recovery.
Placing expanses of additional acreage under irrigation along the Columbia makes little sense when Idahoans are being asked to provide more water.
"There are many other considerations: ocean fishing, in-stream gill netting, habitat degradation, the need to improve turbines, and fish collectors."
We will probably all have to make concessions.
Any reasonable solution must be based on sound science.
It would be foolish indeed to blow out the dams only to see the fish continue to decline.
Another environmental issue has to do with audits.
"The statute giving amnesty to those who voluntarily submit to environmental audits, although presented with good intentions, has created serious questions."
I allowed it to become law only after a sunset clause was added.
"That sunset will soon be reached, and I am not willing to extend it, in its current form."
"Because of lawsuits and judicial decrees, we have had to rededicate our efforts on water quality issues."
A federal judge says we must do more to implement S. 1284.
We will look at all water quality programs being supervised by the state and refocus those resources to better meet Judge Dwyer's demands as economically as possible.
The alternative is to impose more fees or taxes in order to comply.
A tidal wave of legalized gambling is engulfing the United States.
"We have succumbed to a gaming frenzy, and it seems as if we do not have the collective will to blunt it or turn it back."
"Here in Idaho, we have wisely refrained from jumping headlong into the race for gambling profits."
"We have a lottery, live and simulcast racing, and social bingo."
"But, we also have a widespread and growing violations of our gambling laws."
"Federal authorities, under the Clinton administration, have been timid in their enforcement of gambling laws on reservations."
We need to face the question squarely.
Do we think it is okay to shut our eyes to casino-type gambling on reservations?
"If so, do we want to afford the same opportunity to other Idahoans?"
I do not believe that we can or should maintain a double standard.
"Either we condone video poker and slot machines in Idaho, or we do not."
Our wagers on off-track betting are also burgeoning.
Idaho -- where are we going on gambling?
"Although the initiative process has not yet reached dangerous proportions in Idaho, it does bear watching."
"It is unseemly at best, and dangerous at worst, for paid petition bearers to alter the laws of Idaho."
Let's tighten up -- we do not need a California-style ballot in our state.
The electoral process is healthy.
Idahoans respond to campaigns with a high percentage of eligible voters participating.
"However, the time has come when we should modify our statutes regarding allowable contributions and expenditures on political races."
I will be presenting comprehensive campaign finance reforms.
"These will include proposals to ban foreign and out-of-state contributions; limit contributions for statewide candidates and initiatives to $5,000 from most all sources; and limit candidates for legislative and local offices to $1,000 similarly."
"I also favor dealing with the trash from so-called ""independent"" sources which littered our airwaves this past election."
"Our constitution limits the range of possible reforms but, we must proceed."
"I will work with you to draft legislation, but I will not accept any one-sided solutions."
"While I believe that the monetary influence of interest groups should be diminished, their advice and counsel is still important."
"We need to listen to the views of Mitch Sanchotena of Idaho Steelhead and Salmon Unlimited, and Joe Hinson of Intermountain Forest Industry Association."
"We can learn from Mike Medberry of Idaho Conservation League, and from Steve Ahrens of Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry."
The reason these diverse voices are so important is that our state has a wide and varied range of interests.
We are growing rapidly and we must provide jobs for our young people so that they do not have to move out as they did 20 years ago.
We need to find those opportunities without unduly impacting our incomparable quality of life.
"We must harvest our timber and still recover our fish runs; graze our cattle and sheep, but protect our riparian areas; encourage our highly productive irrigated farms and aquaculture -- at the same time improving the quality of our rivers -- enjoy the bountiful riches of our mines, but carry out complete restoration and refrain from contamination of air and water."
We will encourage expansion of job opportunities by hi-tech industries.
"We will also encourage their participation in alleviating growth-created problems -- such as the Micron interchange, half of which is to be built by private money."
"We will build our future in our schools, in job training, and in economic development initiatives."
Our geography is diverse -- our heritage and demographics are a kaleidoscope.
"We face a wide variety of problems, but unlimited opportunities."
We are blessed to live in the best of all possible states within this miracle of all nations -- past and present -- the United States of America.
Let us thank God for this privilege and resolve that we will make our state even better.
