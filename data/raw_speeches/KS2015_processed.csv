SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Madam President, Legislators, Elected Officials, Cabinet Members, Justices of the Kansas Supreme Court, Leaders of Kansas sovereign Native AmericanNations, Lt. Governor and his wife Ruth, the first lady of Kansas, my wife Mary.My Fellow Kansans."
"One person I wantto recognize in particular is the new House Minority Leader, Tom Burroughs.Tom, welcome to leadership.Good evening and welcome back."
"Before I begin the State of the State in earnest this evening, I want to pay tribute to themen and women of our armed forces."
The strength of Kansas is best represented by thosewhorisk their lives to protect us.
Major General Paul Funk from Fort Riley currently is leading the fight against ISIS.
So obviously he is not here with us tonight.
Instead we are honored to recognize all the brave Kansans who serve through the presence of Brigadier General Eric Wesley and Command Sergeant Major Maurice Jackson of Fort Riley.
Please help me welcome and recognize them.
"I am informed by the clerks thatof the 165 current members of the Legislature, about 100 of themare new to the body since 20101."
"That is to say, many of youhave never had the opportunity as Legislators to hear a different Governor give a State of the State Speech."
"And for that, I don’t apologize."
"But, I will keep this speech as short and concise as I can."
"Throughout my career in public service, I have been driven by the belief that Government exists to serve the people."
"Those who lead, those who govern,must doso with courage and compassion."
"In that way, those we serve can live infreedom and dignity."
"That belief continues to guide my actions today, as it did four years ago when I gave my first State of the State message."
"At that time, we gathered to address the challenges confronting our state."
Two of the biggest challenges were our economy and budget.
"On that January night, four years ago, more than 100,000 Kansans were actively looking for work and could not find it2."
Kansas ranked near the bottomamong US states in private sector job growth3.
Personal incomegrowthwas low and poverty was headed up4.
"From 1999-2009, the number of Kansans in private sector employment hadactuallydropped –actually dropped -5while state general fundspending had grownby more than a third6."
"In Fiscal Year 2010, for thefirst and only time in Kansas history, the State General Fund ended the fiscal year in a negative status7."
Our economic and fiscal course wasclearlyunsustainable.It was time for a change.
"From this podium, Iannounced that the days of ever-expanding government wereover.Andwe went to work."
"We reformed state government to better serve Kansans by eliminating, consolidating, or privatizing multiple state agencies and redundant functions8, andreduced the public sector workforce by more than three thousand positions9."
"We embarked on a budgetary course that saw State General Fund expenditures grow at a lower rate than throughout the terms of each of the previous nine Governors10, while continuing to support core government functions and serving Kansans."
"With bipartisan support, we overhauled our state’s economic development strategy11, established rural opportunity zones12, and strengthenedKPERS13."
"Four years later, I submit these facts for your review."
"Kansas has created more than 59,000 new private sector jobs14."
Our unemployment rate is tied for the tenth lowest in America15and more Kansans are working today than ever in the history of the state16.
"Personal income is rising17, we are addressing the causes of poverty, and welfare rolls have been cut in half18."
"Thanks to the efforts of ourteachers and parents,Kansas students score among the best in the country19, record numbers of Kansans are enrolled in technical education20and our institutions of higher education are global leaders in fields from animal health21to aeronautics22to the universal fight againstcancer23."
"Mr. Speaker, Madam President, it is for these reasons and more that I can report to you tonight that Kansas is on the rise, and the State of our State is STRONG!Aswe have always known in Kansas, great achievementsrequirehard work."
It requiresthe courage to face our challenges head-onand find solutions that work for Kansans.
"The goal of the Department for Children and Families is to be the agency of opportunity, helping Kansans move from poverty to prosperity."
One of our great successes has been the number of people who have left welfare and found work.
We have seen more than a 50 percent decline in TANF recipients in the last four years24.
"Instead of welfare, we wantKansans to enjoy the dignityof work and build a better life for themselves and their families.This is to be celebrated."
Valerie Cahill is a single motherwho was on public assistance.
"With the help of our Employment and Training program, Valerie is now earning full-time wages in the medical industry and is off welfare assistance."
"Valerieand her son,Cortez, are here with us tonight."
"Valerie, willyou and your son please stand so we can congratulate you on thecourageandperseverance that has allowed you to build a better life for you and your son."
"We will continue to move forward, helping people move from dependence on the government to independence."
We will put forth programs that require more able-bodied welfare recipients to apply for work or work training as a condition of receiving the welfare benefit.
One of the key ways out of poverty and despair is through work.
That brings hope and that brings a path forward.
"Tomove forward, we need all of Kansas growing."
This includes our urban cores that in too many cases have seen their problems multiply andtheirsolutions divide.
"In the first term, we implemented Rural Opportunity Zones.It has been a success."
"77 counties have embraced it withmore than2,000applicationsreceived25–and more than a quarter of those are from out-of-state26."
People are coming to Kansas for opportunity and growth.
It is time to take this same successful concept to our urban core.
"I am proposing that we provide the same growth tools to high poverty areasin Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka."
The same requirements for local participationwillexist as well.
This willhelpmore Kansans succeed and will draw more people to our state.
"Now, even as we celebrate our successes, we must acknowledge that the most recent data regardingstategovernment revenue and expenditures present a clear challenge that must beaddressed27."
"For the past several weeks, we have been in consultation withgovernment,business and industry leaders regarding our shared fiscal concerns."
They have been generous with their time and frank with their advice.
Tomorrow I will present to the legislature a proposed two-year budget that is in balance –with revenues exceeding expenditures each year.
And we will continue our march to zero income taxes.
Because the states with no income tax consistently grow faster than those with high income taxes28.
There may be some who consider this course too bold.
"well,I’m thesort of guy who would have sentAlex Gordon from third base."
I propose this budget as a starting point to your deliberations.
I understand and appreciate that the “power of the purse” is yours and does not belong to any other branch of government29.
In my travels around Kansas I’ve found what I expect most of you have during your visits with the people we serve.
"Kansans are sensible, decent, compassionate, thoughtful people."
"They prize liberty, celebrate achievement and recognize an obligation to their fellow man."
"They want government to focus on its core functions, to perform them well, to provide quality services, good schools, good roadsand low taxes."
Kansansunderstand the importance of living within our meansand meeting our obligations.
"Kansansknow the importance of a promise whether to friends, family or a business."
"And recognizing that promise, they paytheir debts on time and in full."
The KansasConstitution should reflect thatas well.
I am proposingthe Legislature pass a Constitutional Amendmentand put it before Kansas votersstating thedebt of the state is a general obligation of the state and we will pay it first.
This is good policy for our state.
"Those who make state policy in the people’s name have to make the tough choices.Those who refuse, don’t lead."
Everyone will be able to find things in the budget I put forth that they disagree with.
"I hope as you review the budget, you put forth what youwould do to make it better."
"But as we go about this work, please bear two things in mind."
"First, the family budget is more powerful than the government budget."
"Second, agrowing economy that is adding private sector jobs and increasing personal income can fix a government budget."
A growing government budget cannot bring lasting prosperity to its citizens by appropriating ever more of their earnings.
"If we could spend our way to paradise, wewould already be there."
40 Governorsheld office before theState General Fund Expendituresreached$1 Billion for the first time30.
The next4 Governorssaw that number hit$6 Billion31.
That government spending growth was not reflective of the trajectory of our population or of the economy32.
It was government getting too big too fast.
"The era of ever expanding government is over,because it has to be."
"The major drivers instate spending increases arewhat you think they are:K-12 education33, public pensions34and Medicaid35."
"Over the past several years, in addition toproviding medical care in war zones around the world, Lt Governor Colyer has led our efforts to improve services and control costs in Medicaid.The results havebeen good."
Waiting lists are down36andservicesare up37.
"Costs are growing, but at a slower rate than before38."
"On pensions, we have enacted reform and succeeded in devoting considerably more resources to what was a badly underfunded system."
"In 2010, according to the Pew Center, Kansas had the second worst funded pensions system among all the U. S. states39."
"Thanks to the reforms undertaken since, done with bipartisan support, our rankings have improved and we are now middle-of-the-pack40."
"Understandthough, thatthe unfunded liability in KPERS vastly exceeds any issues with our year-to-yearbudget."
It dwarfs every other item on the state balance sheet41.
All of those truly interested in fiscal prudence should support putting our state retirement system on a sound long-term footing.
"Now, on the matter of K-12 spending."
A majority of the projected shortfall we face is due to increases in K-12 spending since Fiscal Year 201442.I want to repeat that.
A majority of the projected shortfall we face is due to increases in K-12 spending.
"For decades now, Kansas has struggled under a school finance formula which is designed not to be understood---to frustrate efforts at accountability and efficiency."
"A formula designed to lock in automatic,massive increases in spending unrelated to actual student populations or improvedstudent achievement."
"A formula which calculates that we have added more than 100,000 new students43to the public schools while the actual census has grown by a fraction of that number44---an accounting scheme that claims cuts to per pupil spending even as budget increases dramatically outpace increases in student population45."
"Not surprisingly, that formula has been under litigationin Kansas for the past 40 years."
"Just within the last few weeks, the latest ruling was issued in a suit filed under the previous Administration46."
"In the words of thatcourtruling, “one cannot classify the school financing structure as reliably constitutionally sound47.I agree."
"Friends, it is time for a new school finance formula."
"That formula should reflect real-world costs and put dollars in classrooms with real students, not in bureaucracy and buildings and artificial gimmicks."
"That formula should be about improving student achievement and school accountability,not bureaucratic games."
"My suggestion is simple, and I believe necessary---a timeout in the school finance wars."
"In this two-year budget, the Legislature should appropriate money directly to school districts, so it can be spent where it is neededmost, and that’s in the classroom."
"At the same time, the Legislature should repeal the existing school finance formula and allow itself sufficient time to write a new modern formula that meets our needs for great 21stCentury schools."
"And as wego about that process, it should be accountable to local parents and voters,because here the people rule.Accountability."
You have heard me say that we must be accountable with our budget and education policy.
That accountability should extend to how our elected officials and judiciaryare selected.
"Currently, most elected officials in Kansas are chosen in elections when the fewest voters participate."
"In general, Spring elections see a mere fraction of the voters who participate in Fall elections."
generally with about 10 percent of eligible voters coming to the pollsin the Spring48.
Yet that’s when most of our elected officials are selected.
That does not honor our valuesof wanting higher voter participation.
It is time to move local elections to the Fall.
Italsois time we change the way we pick our Supreme Court.
"Recently, the Legislature introduced a greater element of public accountability to judicial selection by reforming the process for selecting appellate judges in Kansas49."
It is time for similar reforms to apply to the Kansas Supreme Court.
"Currently, we have the least democratic system in America to select Supreme Court justices."
"The Legislature shouldput before Kansas voters aproposed Constitutional amendment for amore democratic selection process---one either based on the federal model or providing for direct election of Supreme Court justices, as we did for the first 100 years of our history."
"With the Court involving itself in so many public policy issues, it is time the selection process be more democratic."
Now we turn to a subject that will directly affect the future of every single Kansan.And that is.water.
In my first term I challenged my administration and the citizens of Kansas to develop a long-term vision for the future ofthewater supply in our state.
And you answered that challenge50.Now it is time for us to act.
Water is an intensely passionate issue where local situations vary enormously.
We have not yet accomplished a plan that ensures adequate water supplies throughout our state for the next 50 years butthis will happen before my second term is concluded.
"When I began my comments this evening, I told you that throughout my career, I have been driven by a belief that we are here to serveothers."
"It is a God-given responsibility that we, aselected officials must accept and act upon."
We are at our best when we stir within ourselves our better angels.
When our hearts are tender to what God is tender to.
"the poor, the voiceless, the powerless."
"We should see human lifeas sacred,and recognize its immeasurable worth in every human condition."
"Whether at the beginning of life,or the end of life, Kansas is the most pro-life state in America51.And we are not going back."
So let us bewise and loving in how we serve the peopleparticularly those in the greatest need at the time of their greatest need.
We need a budget that is adequate andnot pernicious.
"We need social policies that are wise and helpful, and which lead people fromdependence to independence."
"We need strong, healthy marriages and families."
"As I said at the Inauguration, big government can never be big enough to replace the family."
And we need vision to pass on to our children and their children to come.
A vision of Kansas that stands the test of time because it is built on truth.
"So as we move forward in this legislative session, let us be wise and prudent and act in the way that the Ancients told us to."
"That is that our actions should be “first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere52."
"Thank you and may God grant us all grace, mercy and truth to carry out our duties."
