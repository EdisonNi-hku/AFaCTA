Madame President, Mr. Speaker, honorable members of this General Assembly, reverend clergy, friends, and citizens of the State of Connecticut, I want to thank you for that warm applause.
When I addressed the General Assembly last June in Joint Session, I thanked each and every one of you for your hard work and dedication.
Together, we made the 1995 session one of the most successful and productive in decades.
It was truly an historic session.
Together we charted a new course for this state.
One filled with hope and opportunity for the people of Connecticut.
Let the Washington spectacle be an example of what we will never tolerate as Democrats and Republicans governing here in Connecticut.
We put aside our political differences and made our main focus the best interests of the people of Connecticut.
In those five months, we created goodwill, cooperation, partnership, teamwork and bipartisanship.
We ushered in the New Spirit of Connecticut.
And for that, all of the people of Connecticut join me in thanking you.
During the past year, we have shown that mutual respect and common courtesy can be the hallmark of a successful legislative session.
Let's pledge, once again, to govern in the same bipartisan spirit during this legislative session.
We're on the move again, and we can't let the citizens of this wonderful state down.
They are counting on us to continue the revolution we started last year, to continue making the state a better one in which to live and do business.
We inherited decades of ever increasing state spending and -- together -- we enacted the lowest spending increase in over thirty years.
We confronted runaway state bonding and we reduced it to a prudent level.
Together, we lowered business taxes, we reformed unemployment compensation, we reformed workers compensation.
We decided to do more than just talk.
We actually changed the business climate to create jobs.
We have attracted approximately thirty new, substantial businesses and five thousand jobs in 1995.
And today I would like to announce yet another new business that has moved to Connecticut.
Greenwald Industries has committed to bring 125 new manufacturing jobs from New York City to Connecticut.
"Their 120,000 square foot facility is the direct result of ""The New Spirit in Connecticut."
The new Department of Environmental Protection made it happen, by working with businesses rather than against them.
We have a new CEO here with us today, Mr. Len Semela.
We welcome you and your new jobs in Connecticut.
We also revolutionized the way state government does business.
We consolidated departments.
We reduced mandates.
And we began the process of converting all state workers to a 40-hour work week.
We empowered our state employees to do their jobs.
And every department of state government has accepted the commitment to be customer- friendly and responsive to those we serve.
We led the nation in making real changes to the welfare system.
We've moved beyond just tinkering with the old system; we are shattering the cycle of dependency.
Together, we said Jobs First, and we have started down the road to replacing the disrespect of handouts with the dignity of work.
We finally put a time limit on welfare so that it will again be a short path to a better life, not a permanent lifestyle.
To ensure that our children can live in dignity and aren't dependent on welfare checks, we enacted child support legislation that targeted deadbeat parents.
Our message was simple: If you are not supporting your children, we will revoke every license that you have in Connecticut.
Within the first few weeks of this new law, between 3,000 and 4,000 delinquent parents called into our offices accepting their responsibility to care for their children.
Some even showed up with cash in their hand.
In one month alone we collected over $1.5 million from delinquent parents.
Together, we are also fighting the crucial battle against crime.
With the passage of a workable death penalty, truth-in-sentencing, our tough version of Megan's Law, and juvenile justice reform, we are winning this war.

Imagine that, 14% of the sentence ordered by the courts.
Today the average time served is 47% and it's getting better everyday.
But, in the final analysis, no criminal justice system is worth its salt if it fails to recognize the rights of victims.
We need to focus more attention on the victims who are left to cope with the tragic aftermath of violent crime.
Accordingly, I will strongly support a constitutional amendment to protect victims rights.
And when it comes to improving education in Connecticut, we did more than just applaud our men's and women's UConn basketball teams.

Now we must take the next step.
We have found the key to successful state government.
Let's leave our politics at the door and do the job we were elected to do -- because the promise of Connecticut still remains a dream unfulfilled.
It is time to boldly chart a new course.
And today let's discuss the elements of this journey, our journey for the Connecticut family.
It is our responsibility to redefine the relationship of our state government, both to our cities and to ourselves.
Wise leadership is more than policies, programs, and lines in a budget.
It is both being practical and having a thoughtful commitment to principle.
It is realistically articulating and applying a philosophy that can fulfill hopes and dreams.
I believe in a government that is bold enough to be basic.
Our government must be steadfast in supporting the free-enterprise system and it must provide the opportunity for us to aspire and achieve.
It must not be a roadblock to our hopes and dreams.
It must be smart and efficient.
It must make sense.
And it must help to care for the children and elderly who are alone or endangered, so that the frailest among us live in comfort and dignity.
Too many of us are unemployed or live in fear of losing our jobs.
Too many of us are frustrated by an economy that does not always reward our hard work.
We must create a business climate that generates jobs for members of the Connecticut family to prosper.
It means controlling the size and scope of state government so that businesses can create jobs.
And there is no more important place to restore jobs than in our cities.
We are beginning to see brighter horizons on the economic front, however the sad fact is that our state is becoming a state of have and have nots.
It is our responsibility to create hope and opportunity across Connecticut -- not just in elite pockets of promise, but in all of our states neighborhoods.
I cannot overstate the problem.
Some of the neighborhoods in these once grand cities have become warehouses of crime, misery and decay.
Of the ten fastest shrinking cities in America, four are the most troubled cities in Connecticut -- New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, and Waterbury.
They have lost more than 51,000 jobs in the last ten years.
Their high school dropout rates are more than double the statewide average.
We already spend almost $1 billion in welfare payments and other state aid in these cities.
History has taught us that throwing money at the cities is not the answer.
We must make very deliberate and targeted efforts that can pay huge dividends.
Building public-private partnerships and using state funds to leverage private investment will be the driving force behind our initiatives.
It is essential that all levels of government work together to make this effort succeed.
There are encouraging signs.
In Hartford, comprehensive plans are popping up to revitalize several areas, specifically the Charter Oak, Frog Hollow, and Veeder Root projects.
In all of these projects there are substantial private resources, such as the commitment by First Fidelity and Trinity College with an emphasis on grass-roots involvement.
I have already assembled Team Bridgeport, which includes senior members of my administration, local and state elected officials and members of the private sector, all of whom have joined forces in the revitalization effort.
We have already designated millions in infrastructure and economic-development aid to stimulate the renaissance of Bridgeport.
We are targeting communities in four cities as Neighborhood Revitalization Zone pilots: in Bridgeport, in Waterbury, in Stamford and in New Britain.
We will continue funding community policing in our major cities.
I am asking you to increase urban revitalization money in the coming year's capital budget.
These monies will be targeted to our most distressed urban centers for economic and community development.
We are committed to a $125 million dollar investment plan over the next five years.
But the state cannot rebuild the city alone.
I commend Peoples Bank for its commitment of $61 million dollars to the people of the Bridgeport community.
We are off to a promising start in a city of so much promise.
We continue to look for public-private partnerships in our other major urban areas.
Our cities can never become competitive as long the legislature places huge mandates on our cities and towns, mandates that adversely affect our urban centers.
Lieutenant Governor Jodi Rell spent much of the past year crisscrossing the state, visiting 101 town halls and meeting with officials from all 169 cities and towns.
At every stop, our Lieutenant Governor has heard cries for mandate relief from our local leaders.
We can no longer ignore these pleas.
This is the year to reform these mandates.
On the issue of taxes, I will not waiver in my commitment to reduce taxes.
State income tax relief and property tax relief will stand.
The tax cuts are law and they will stay law.
Any bill that reaches my desk that proposes to repeal the tax cuts will be vetoed.
In addition, I am proposing to build on the vital tax relief that we are providing our businesses, especially those in our urban areas.
We are going to reinstate the computer tax credit as a signal to our insurance companies that we are here to help in these uncertain times.
We will phase out the excess hospital tax to lower health care costs.
And for small businesses, a credit on sales tax for job creation.
In this year we will implement the new research and development tax credit to stimulate growth in our high tech industries.
And finally, we will continue to reduce workers compensation assessments this year.
No urban agenda would be complete without an emphasis on education.
No social program will rescue our children from poverty.
Education is the vital bridge from poverty to productivity.
Yet, on the first day of school in Hartford, 6,000 kids didn't even show up -- and yes we have heard all the excuses!
It's time to demand some real accountability and individual responsibility.
A child who is not in school is a child getting into trouble.
If parents on state assistance won't get their children to school, I say, No School, No Check -- and I am directing Department of Social Services Commissioner Joyce Thomas and Education Commissioner Ted Sergi to present a plan to us as soon as possible.
Today, I pledge to you to build a consensus, to work with you to frame a school-choice proposal that will be innovative and which will open up educational opportunities for all our children.
I am including an additional million dollars to help disadvantaged students stay in school and go on to college.
And wherever we live today, there is no doubt that teen pregnancy and substance abuse are the root causes of most of our problems.
Therefore, I propose an increase of $3 million dollars for substance abuse and teen pregnancy prevention.
In his November 1994 Grand Jury report, Judge Spada painted a depressing picture of Hartford's welfare program.
It is time for able-bodied recipients -- employable people -- to go to work.
I am proposing that we limit cash benefits for these able-bodied employable men and women.
We have made major changes in the state welfare program, now it is time for the city welfare recipients to go to work also.
These initiatives will change urban life as we know it today, but these issues pale in comparison to the need to protect the children of our state.
No event in my first year in office has touched me more than the tragic death of Baby Emily back in March 1995.
In many respects, I took her death personally and I've dedicated myself to reforming child protection in this state.
I have worked hard with Department of Children and Families Commissioner Linda Rossi over the past year to do everything in our power to stop the abuse and neglect of our tiniest, most vulnerable citizens.
After Baby Emily's death, I insisted that the department review 4,500 cases of at-risk children all under the age of six.
I also requested that an outside independent panel review the circumstances surrounding Emily's death and recommend changes for child protection in the state.
As a result, child protection has undergone a major shift in our state.
Over the past year, these changes have meant increased costs.
But, I will not shy away from our commitment to reforming the system.
Today, I am asking the Legislature to add $40 million to the Department of Children and Families budget in response to this ever increasing problem and to protect the children of our state.
We are proposing additional money to the Birth to Three program as well, so that even more children can be served.
But this all means shifting priorities!
We must balance the needs of our state and my budget does just that.
It makes tough choices.
I propose a budget that is $73 million below what you passed last year.
I am proposing to eliminate some agencies that have no business being a function of government.
I am proposing to eliminate duplication and waste to ensure better accountability and service to the public.
On the issue of our seniors, Lillian McDonnell of Madison recently wrote us.
Today, I just want to let all our seniors know that they are valued members of our community.
We appreciate the contributions they have made over these years.
I know that there has been a great deal of concern about the impact that changes in Washington could have on our elderly.
But I want to make it clear that we are keeping our commitments to our elderly.
We will not abandon them.
We will maintain all programs for the elderly such as Conn PACE.
In fact we propose adding more than $40 million to the budget for the nursing home program.
As your Governor, I have today presented a budget that forges a link in the chain of Connecticut's future.
It nurtures our children, respects our parents, and creates opportunity to aspire and attain our dreams.
Let us never lose sight of our ultimate goal -- to create jobs in Connecticut.
I ask you to join the hundreds of private business people who have been out there for months generating interest in our small but resourceful state.
I ask you to join them -- as Ambassadors.
Ambassadors that focus on what is right about Connecticut -- our unparalleled quality of life.
I'd like to paraphrase some remarks of Daniel Webster, delivered on the Senate Floor some 166 years ago: Our proper business is improvement.
Let our age be the age of improvement.
Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.
Let us cultivate a true spirit of union and harmony.
I ask that you join with me to continue the good work of the past year.
Together, let us again work as a team to fulfill the promise of this great state so that it can become the splendid place for all to enjoy!
Thank you.
