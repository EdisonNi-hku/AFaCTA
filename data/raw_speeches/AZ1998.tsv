President Brenda Burns, Speaker Jeff Groscost, Senate Minority Leader Jack Brown and House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, Honorable Senators and Representatives, distinguished guests, and fellow Arizonans throughout the State, good afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome.
Well, it is great to be back in the House!
I must admit that I never dreamed I would be speaking in this Chamber again, much less as Governor.
As I said when I was sworn in on September 8th, I feel as though God has touched my life.
And though I do not always understand His plan, I have learned not to question it.
At this time I would like to publicly thank my husband for his support.
He and the rest of my family will always come first.
I would like Terry and the other members of my family to stand and be recognized.
I have been given an unprecedented opportunity to serve the people of Arizona.
Only by working together will we guarantee our mutual success as we move into the 21st Century.
While we should assure the education and health of children, and the security of our communities, government should not do for people what they can do for themselves.
Instead we should help people prosper and grow by getting out of their way, thus encouraging their creativity and initiative.
My first step after taking office was to make sure we improved the level of communication by removing the artificial barriers that have sprung up throughout state government.
To this end I have brought people on board who share my core values of responsibility, integrity, cooperation and efficiency.
Although we as elected officials, may not always agree on every issue, in the end we are all on the same team.
Talking to political opponents or other branches of government is not an act of weakness, but of strength.
Re-opening the lines of communication also reminds us of one extremely important fact -- we work for the same people.
Open communication is the hallmark of my Administration.
I used to sit where you are sitting and I know how important it is to be included.
Your challenges are daunting enough under the best of circumstances.
We can rise to the occasion by speaking clearly to each other about our ideals and our differences.
Since I have become Governor, Arizonans have made one thing abundantly clear -- they are tired of the bickering and the name-calling.
They expect, and in fact they demand, capable effective leadership from all of us.
And they look for results.
We must accept responsibility for our actions.
If I make a mistake, and I probably will, I will accept the responsibility, correct the problem, and move forward.
I am also mindful of the fact that Arizona is more than metropolitan Phoenix.
I value the friendships I have made throughout this State.
Many friends have chosen to embrace the values and lifestyles that their smaller communities enjoy.
They confront issues unique to rural areas.
This Administration will not forget them or their needs.
As Governor I will continue to reach out to everyone.
I have high expectations of excellence.
for myself, for my staff, and for all of us.
The people of Arizona share those high expectations.
I won't give up on a problem before we find a resolution, or accept less than the best solution.
This is also our opportunity to set a high ethical standard.
"Though ""political"" ethics has become almost a joke, I know ethics and integrity are important to those of you sitting in this Chamber."
They are definitely important to me.
Arizona is at a crossroads.
This Legislature and this Administration must confront a set of issues reaching a crisis point in public education, health care, the protection of children, and in creating permanent tax relief.
Since becoming Governor I have spoken with many people throughout this State about such concerns.
Arizonans work hard, they cherish their freedom and faith and are not afraid to speak their minds.
They have confided in me their top priorities: their homes and their families, the job security to protect them both, and the preservation of the beauty of our State.
These are the guiding principles we must keep foremost in our minds as we govern.
We have the opportunity to establish the direction that Arizona will follow for decades to come.
How do we meet these challenges?
Look at what we have already done!
The recent Special Session was a success during which much was accomplished.
We provided immediate funding for Child Protective Services and expanded the Family Builders program in both Tucson and Phoenix.
We assured the fiscal stability of the Arizona Long-term Care System.
We completed necessary repair work on the juvenile justice reform bill.
We corrected the legislation that subsidizes health insurance for the working poor.
And, we enacted several election law changes that will benefit the public.
I know some of you were disappointed that we did not address changes in the welfare reform legislation.
For the record, I support welfare reform.
I always have.
I want to help resolve the remaining issues.
EDUCATION Let's start with my top priority, education.
My view is basic: I believe every Arizona child has the absolute right to a quality education in a safe school environment.
There can be no exceptions.
We have to solve the bricks and mortar problem.
We start by resolving the capital funding issue in a way that is fair to our children and meets the test of the Supreme Court.
Not just because we have been ordered, but because it is the right thing to do.
I am committed to finding a solution that guarantees every child, from Yuma to Showlow, from Douglas to Kingman, an opportunity to learn in adequate facilities.
My Administration has met with all the interested parties and has analyzed the various existing plans.
In consultation with the President and the Speaker, we have agreed to resolve this issue together, before completing the budget.
We can not, and we will not, just throw money at this problem or any other.
But realistically, I think we all know there is no such thing as a free lunch.
My budget will include spending increases for education, including a set-aside of more than $125 million dollars to resolve the capital finance crisis.
These monies are in addition to monies already earmarked for capital purposes.
We must try to solve it without raising taxes, if necessary by re-shaping our budget priorities.
However, I think the more fundamental issue is what our children are learning and how they are taught.
Our education system isn.
t making the grade.
For example, 43% of Arizona fourth graders score at or below basic levels in math.
And 50% score below basic levels in reading.
We need to find out why.
Children with a poor foundation in these basic skills will lag behind for the rest of their school lives.
Perhaps our first step toward a solution is a step back.
I believe that grammar schools should teach basic learning skills, that there are right and wrong answers, that good behavior should be expected, and that objective, standardized testing should be used to measure the progress of our students and of our schools.
I believe students, parents, administrators, teachers and even neighborhoods must be accountable for the performance of our schools.
My office, this Legislature and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Keegan should help school districts make the changes they need.
After all, that is the true meaning of local control.
We must provide a solid learning foundation in the earliest primary grades and our allocation of resources should reflect that focus.
I believe that parents should have the choice of where to send their children to school and that alternatives, like charter schools, provide healthy competition and innovation which improve our overall education system.
We must continue to remind parents that nothing can compensate for failure in the home.
A parent.
s most important responsibility is to make sure his or her child heads to school every day well-loved, well-nourished, well-behaved and ready to learn.
It has been popular lately to blame teachers for many of the problems in the classroom.
I will not join that criticism.
We expect more out of Arizona teachers today than ever before, yet their financial rewards are meager.
They must be psychologists, police officers, social workers, secretaries, doctors, and nutritionists.
In the time they have left, they are supposed to teach.
I believe we need to give teachers back control of their classrooms.
If we need to create alternatives to mainstream schools for consistently disruptive students, then we should start making those plans now.
We are witnessing the first generation of parents in history who are as concerned about violence and drugs at school as they are about report cards.
School districts have rightly created zero tolerance programs for drugs and guns.
It is time for us to help them extend that policy to return order to their classrooms.
"Maybe they should put up a sign, ""No Drugs, No Guns& No Lip!"""
This is our chance to revitalize and revolutionize Arizona's public school system.
Working together, we can create a legacy of learning that will be enjoyed by our grandchildren's children.
HEALTHCARE FOR CHILDREN My next priority also involves children.
In our State, one child in every five is not covered by health insurance.
Arizona has the country's fourth highest rate of uninsured children.
We already know that uninsured children see doctors less regularly, are less likely to be immunized, and are often under-treated or untreated.
Their poor health starts an early downward spiral.
A sick child can't learn and an uneducated child can't succeed.
I am proposing a program called KidsCare that will provide health insurance to Arizona's most in-need children, the children of working poor families.
These are people who work.
They just don't make very much money.
Their children deserve to be protected.
A new federal program provides more than $112 million dollars in federal health care funds in exchange for investing only $36 million dollars in un-allocated, but already collected, tobacco tax funds.
Together, that federal/state investment can provide nearly $700 million dollars in medical coverage for our uninsured children over the next five years.
I know many of you are wary of funding from the feds and even more skeptical of what sounds like a new entitlement program.
I share your concerns.
I have taken steps to make sure this does not become an endless economic drain caused by a federal program.
First, the legislation that will be introduced will guarantee that expenditures will always be capped so they cannot exceed revenues.
Second, the program is automatically repealed if the federal funding is eliminated.
KidsCare will give us the chance to utilize federal money that comes from our taxes and protects us from the vagaries of the Federal Government.
Arizona's poorest children need this program.
I look forward to working with you to pass this legislation.
While we are on the subject of health care, it would be an understatement to say the Department of Health Services is facing some immediate challenges.
To help meet those, I am pleased to announce that after a thorough selection process, I will appoint Dr. James Allen to head the Department.
Dr. Allen is my guest today and I would ask that he stand and be recognized.
I know that he is eager to start and we all look forward to working with him.
We have some lofty goals for DHS in 1998.
We must take the steps necessary to obtain re-certification for the state hospital.
We must rescue the Department's Behavioral Health Division from its current emergency.
And finally we must work to resolve the Arnold vs. Sarn court order that has tied our hands for nearly two decades.
CRIME Another priority will be fighting crime.
At this time I would like to publicly thank the many police officers and firefighters who daily put their lives on the line to protect our lives and our homes.
Every State of the State speech for the past two decades has addressed the issue of crime.
Unfortunately, despite all the attention, and all the money, problems still persist.
I believe in tough enforcement and swift, fair justice.
"I advocate a ""one strike and you're out"" policy."
But, I also believe we must do a better job of preventing crime, especially with juveniles.
That is why I am excited about a program I plan to develop in partnership with all levels of government and the private sector.
Our aim is to attack crime the way it must be attacked, with total community participation.
This program will foster neighborhood involvement by coordinating the efforts of police, educators, human service specialists, job trainers, drug abuse counselors, and residents.
It will be implemented through grant money and current funds, with no additional revenues.
Our goal must be an entire criminal justice system that works, including courts that are competent, fair and fast.
I know the Governor, with good reason, traditionally stays silent on budget requests by the Judiciary.
But funding for additional court personnel and facilities is needed if we expect our courts to keep pace with the increase in our crime fighting efforts.
I propose a three-pronged approach to crime: a results-oriented, community-based program to zero in on crime enough police officers and prison space to protect our citizens and a fully functioning, fair and swift court system.
All three can be accomplished without raising new or additional revenues.
ENVIRONMENT Education and crime aren't the only issues Arizonans are discussing.
I have heard from many who are concerned about protecting our open space.
I believe some of the most critical open spaces are Arizona.
s working farms and ranches.
This is our heritage and a large part of our identity.
More importantly, it is the lifestyle and livelihood of a great number of Arizona families.
I will do everything I can to make sure they continue to produce by striking the proper balance between a beautiful environment and a bountiful harvest.
Here and in Tucson, we worry about open space in a different way.
We worry that poorly managed growth may damage both our environment and our quality of life.
An anti-growth backlash could hamstring efforts at responsible growth, which is needed to keep our State strong.
Protecting open space must be part of any new growth strategy.
Arizona's unique and diverse natural beauty is an essential part of the legacy we leave our children.
Open space cannot be what remains once we have done everything else.
To that end, I believe that Arizona's state lands may hold a very critical key to resolving some of our open space needs.
We must find ways to meet the objectives of the land trust while still securing the future of some of Arizona's precious open space.
My budget sets aside $5 million dollars for the purchase of state lands through the Arizona Preserve Initiative.
Preserving open space and private land is only part of my commitment to protect our environment.
Last November I signed an Executive Order creating the Governor.
s Air Quality Strategies Task Force.
I have directed the members to address the many air quality concerns facing this Valley.
We must do battle with one of the more visible issues, the brown cloud, without undermining the prosperity of our citizens.
I can tell you that every option being considered will require some sacrifice by each of us.
But cleaning the air is essential to everyone.
s health.
I expect the task force to be prepared with recommendations for your consideration by mid-February.
Additionally, I am recommending that we allocate about $4 million dollars to support our Clean Water Revolving Fund.
This will allow us to receive roughly $22 million dollars in federal funds under the Clean Water Act so Arizona communities can access low cost loans for wastewater facilities.
These monies will primarily benefit smaller cities and rural areas, thereby contributing to their economic development and quality of life.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Protecting the environment makes good economic sense, as does maintaining strong relationships across the oceans and with our neighbors.
The State of Arizona has greatly benefited from international trade and tourism.
We have been a competitive player in the global economy and will continue to do so in the future.
I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to maintaining and strengthening our ties to Mexico.
I have met with Governor Armando Lopez Nogales of Sonora, Mexico twice and I look forward to continuing our dialogue.
We are committed to promoting Arizona and Sonora as a vibrant economic region.
Also important to me is our relationship with our Native American neighbors.
We may have opposing opinions at times, but we ought to approach our differences with mutual respect.
I treasure the years I spent teaching in Chinle and living among the Navajo people.
THE BUDGET AND TAX CUTS Finally, let.
s talk about the subject you have been waiting for.
The most important policy statement made by any Governor is her budget.
I am submitting a budget built on conservative ideals.
It stays the course, adhering to principles that have delivered Arizona from fiscal hardship to unprecedented good health.
This budget calls for some increased spending for children's programs, especially in the areas of education and healthcare.
It also calls for appropriate funding levels for public safety, job training, new technology and an economic boost for state employees.
My budget is built on solid principles that maintain a sound economic infrastructure, encourage continued economic growth and provide protection against future economic downturns.
I will continue the fight to lower taxes.
My budget lays the groundwork for a five-year vision for tax reform.
I am proposing the single largest tax cut in Arizona history.
My proposed $210 million dollar tax cut package provides relief to individual and corporate taxpayers.
It calls for a $100 million dollar cut in vehicle license taxes and a $60 million dollar cut in individual income taxes (including an income tax exemption of $10,000 dollars for family members who care for their elderly at home).
That's $160 million dollars of tax relief for individual Arizonans.
My proposal also addresses the undeniable fact that Arizona is a high business tax state.
Any success we have had in securing new jobs has come in spite of a high business tax burden.
Just imagine the job creation we will unleash when you join me in making our business tax structure more competitive!
To begin reducing business taxes, I propose a corporate income tax cut of $35 million dollars in FY 1999, increasing to $55 million dollars in FY 2000.
I am also asking for a $15 million dollar cut in the personal property taxes paid by small businesses.
The net result of these changes will be an improved ability to attract and retain high-paying jobs.
In addition, I am recommending a temporary two-year cut in the unemployment insurance rate levied on employers, resulting in a savings of $94 million dollars for businesses paying into the fund.
Over the next year we will analyze the fund to determine if a permanent tax cut and/or benefit increase, is warranted.
All combined, my tax cut proposal, the unemployment insurance cut, and the taxes already scheduled to phase out will allow Arizonans to enjoy tax relief of over $300 million dollars in fiscal year 1999.
This budget is based on very conservative revenue estimates, despite past criticism by advocates who would like to see state spending increased.
The reality is that although the United States is in the midst of its second longest economic expansion since World War Two, we know this growth cycle cannot last forever.
Though we will do our best to help it continue, Arizona must be prepared when the next inevitable slowdown begins.
Towards that end, I am recommending an increase in the budget stabilization fund -- the so-called Rainy Day Fund -- that was established while I was Speaker.
Last year you recommended we increase the percentage of revenues dedicated to the fund from 5% to 7% by fiscal year 2000.
Taking your lead, I will recommend we increase that amount to 7.5%.
That would allow us to deposit almost $90 million dollars into the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal year 1999.
This is the fiscally conservative thing to do.
One final important principle that drives the executive budget is controlling the growth of government.
This budget calls for increased spending only where absolutely necessary.
Further, I will pursue policies that direct state agencies to be more responsive to the citizens, to be more cost effective and to improve the quality of services delivered.
THE DAYS AHEAD No speech can adequately address every important issue or provide solutions to every challenge.
But I believe I have outlined a blueprint that speaks to the most significant issues we face -- education, health care, crime, quality of life, and tax reduction.
Although I was not elected to this job, I intend to take full advantage of the opportunity given to me.
To do so I need your help.
And as you know, I am not afraid to ask for it.
I know many of you have proposals.
My door will always be open.
By working together we will find the best solutions.
If we leave our campaigns and our egos at the door, we can achieve great success.
"Mark Twain once said, ""Always do right."
It will gratify some people.
. . and astonish the rest.
Let us do right by the people of Arizona by keeping a steady eye on the mission they have given us: to provide for limited government that encourages the creativity and energy of our citizens, to educate our children and to provide for the safety of our communities.
I will hold that guiding vision before me every day I serve as your Governor.
Thank you and God bless Arizona.
