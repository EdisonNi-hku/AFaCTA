SENTENCES
Welcome!Good morning!
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Chief Justice Taylor and other officers of the judiciary, fellow elected officials, visitors, friends, family and a special greeting to those who are joining us electronically."
"In addition to the customary radio and television coverage, we are live on the Internet by means of Real Audio!"
"Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Mr. President for the courtesies you have extended as we begin the 54th Wyoming Legislature."
I appreciate your help preparing for the session and I look forward to a constructive and positive relationship over the next 38 days!Good news!Well !
How can you beat yesterday’s news from the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group!
A BIG pop in the revenue projections that we hoped for but never really expected.
"Last fall, when I was at a meeting in Gillette, I happened to see a bumper sticker that read A Lord, please, just give us one more boom, and this time we won’t mess it up!"""
"Well, even though it might be short lived, we have our chance!"
The CREG notes that most of the increase is from natural gas.
"Last year at this time, we were going through a mild winter, concerned because the Wyoming posted price at Opal was far below the national average, quoted at Henry Hub."
"This year, the Wyoming quoted price is higher than the National benchmark."
I don’t think that’s ever happened.
Last year’s price disparity led us to concentrate on marketing and pipeline access.
"Even if the primary reason for the increase is the unexpectedly cold winter, part of the increase can be attributed to efforts made to enhance market access."
We expect gas prices to continue to be a bit higher on average but not maintain today’s peak.
"Oil prices are up too, compared to a year ago."
"We expect oil production and prices to decline after this year, but not as much as was predicted a year ago."
"In other minerals, we’re expecting another jump in coal production as Phase 2 of the Clean Air Act is implemented."
And there’s high interest in new trona leases.
It’s anybody’s guess how sustainable the new income will be.It’s unexpected but welcome.
Let’s take advantage of the breather while we tackle the challenges that bring us together today.
"America’s deep freeze has warmed Wyoming’s pocketbook!Well, what’s the net impact?"
I’ll use last January’s revenue prediction as a baseline.
"If sales tax had been raised one full percent and if the gas tax had been raised by five cents per gallon, each for one full year, that would come close to matching the new money in yesterday’s report.That’s a lot!"
Our Highway account is predicted to increase by $14M over the next 18 months.
Local governments over the same period will receive a ten million dollar windfall.
"The University, the Community Colleges, the Water Development Account, the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund - All will see some benefit."
Expenditures - That’s the income side.
Now let’s turn back to the cost of government.
"There’s some good news there, too."
"From 1987 until 1995, Wyoming had a fundamental flaw in its budget system."
Revenue shortfalls were made up through one-time receipts and transfers from reserve accounts.
"This year, we’re starting to see the benefit of better management and prioritization."
The budget I submitted to you last year held growth in state spending to less than one percent.
We are reducing duplication and increasing efficiency in state services.
Specific problems have to be worked out by all affected agencies at the same time.
Coordination isn’t just a good idea.It will be practiced.
We’ve used strategic planning to set priorities for state programs.
"We are the first state in the nation to implement strategic planning statewide, all at once."
We’ve done it with a lot of participation.
Never before have Wyoming people had a greater say in the work of state government.
The supplemental budget for this session represents the lowest supplemental request in recent memory .
"In fact, except for the mineral bust in 1985, there hasn’t been a request this low since the Governor Hathaway days of the early 1970's."
"Plus, we have a larger operating reserve than any in recent years."
"I credit much of our success to our state employees, who took on the task, first with a lot of skepticism, and then with enthusiasm."
You can be proud of the good work being done by state employees on your behalf.
I’m regularly at the Capitol late in the evenings and on weekends.
It’s remarkable how many cars there are in the parking lot during those same long hours -- state employees putting in the extra time just because they want to get the job done right.
"THE ISSUES Education In November 1995, the Supreme Court got our attention in a big way with their decision on school finance."
"The Court found that inequities in funding distribution existed without rationale and, by deduction, inequity was then also present in substance and delivery."
No other state court has ever gone that far.
Responsibility for solving the inequities was thrust back on the Legislature along with the implication that more money would be a significant part of the remedy.
The assumption that more money is needed will loom over everything we discuss this session.
We need to know the cost of education and the formula to distribute the money.
The report from the consultant to establish the cost of education and prescribe the funding formula isn’t due until February 14 which is too late for action this session.
Then the great debate over funding will be whether and how redistribution of today’s funds will be done.
Two little words - Hold Harmless - will set the tone of the debate.
"We will very likely hear the cry ""Don’t let my district lose any of its funds - just bring all the others up to mine!"""
"We must look first to redistribution, to see how close that comes to meeting the standard for cost."
"The ""basket of goods"" for knowledge and skills needed by all students is defined."
Responsibility for setting standards of achievement and assessing the results will lie with the State Board of Education.
There has been very little disagreement or controversy over this part of the remedy.
"Equity of programs should be viewed as equity of opportunity, not equity of achievement."
Responsibility for learning still resides with the student.
The delivery system is where we start to see the need for some heavy lifting.
"Where the state’s responsibility is to set standards, define the means of assessment, determine the funding, help finance construction and then get out of the way, it’s the responsibility of the local districts to decide how to meet the standards."
"The state defines the result, the districts decide the methodology."
"Community based, community accountable."
I have indicated my support for transitional funds for schools as we work to a new system.
"I would support additional funding for schools for legitimate transition needs, but only if they are based on common sense, demonstrated examples of problem areas."
"I have not yet seen a funding mechanism, or a funding level that I would support for the transition."
Most of us believe intuitively that technology can help distance learning and promote preservation of our smaller schools.
But what will be most effective?
I support the recommendation for an RFP to define technology needs and plans.
"A specific demonstration project for technology begins next week, through an extraordinary partnership between the state, private industry and the schools."
"Hughes Satellite Systems and Western TeleCommunications Inc. will provide hardware and technical assistance to demonstrate how two-way interactive video and Internet access can be provided to four of our small high schools - Baggs, Kaycee, Hulett, and Guernsey."
It will give us real experience in understanding the great options out there if we’re willing to form partnerships and stretch our imaginations!
Success of K-12 education depends heavily on the cooperation of our University and the Community Colleges.
"Each has been very supportive in coming up with ideas for schools, including improvement of teacher training, providing dual credit courses, and helping define what will or won’t be productive."
"The potential for reform could begin with the Western Governors’ University, which is a virtual institution that will leverage the best of our western courses and professors to provide better access to higher education at lower costs throughout the West."
"The methods of distance learning, leveraging physical resources, focusing on the best teachers, and meeting the needs of the business community are all principles that we can apply directly to our public schools."
"These principles include choice of courses, choice of teachers, and choice of method and time of delivery and self-guided learning."
This approach needs to be applied to how public schools operate so that we can dramatically change the delivery of education in ways that are long overdue.
"Given that most of the information needed for resolving the issue won’t even be available until later this year, I support the call for a special session in early June."
"Leadership is required of both your Governor and the State Superintendent, but too much of the basic information on cost and delivery is still missing."
Economy and jobs Eight of the ten fastest growing states in America are in the West.
"Wyoming is not one of the fast burners, but it’s only a matter of time before the impact hits us."
"In my meetings around the state, I hear a clear message of let’s grow, but on our terms and with our leadership."
"We don’t want to see explosive growth as in Las Vegas, or the problems that have cropped up along Colorado’s Front Range, or Utah’s Wasatch Front."
"Wyoming’s people say that they want quality jobs and quality communities and we want job opportunities for our young people, but we want it to be compatible with our quality of life."
"Historically, we have depended primarily on Minerals, Tourism and Agriculture."
Now we need economic diversification.Technology based companies.Light manufacturing.
More professions that take advantage of higher education.
But each community has different goals and different standards.
"What then, should be our strategy?"
I suggest four main areas to start.
One - Business says they need a higher quality workforce and opportunities to keep their workers and their businesses up to date.
Two - We want community based definitions of success and community involvement in the design of solutions.
Three - The state should develop a business plan involving state leaders and successful businesses.
Four - Focus on quality of life and protection of our natural resources.
Maintain accessible open spaces and a healthy environment.
Increase access to decisions for development.
The one thing most mentioned by community economic developers and business leaders is that Wyoming needs to help with worker training.
I support the bill that would redirect interest earned on federal payroll tax deposits and tap part of the savings in workers’ compensation premiums.
"The funds that would accumulate would then be awarded upon application by the same employers who paid into the account, to develop new workers and to upgrade existing ones."
We can do it with no new increase in payroll taxes or fees.
Our Workforce Development Council is finally pulling together all the individual and uncoordinated groups that now can build quality workers.
[We have success stories already in Workforce Development that deserve mention.
"First is the Wyoming Microsoft Project , started in Jackson Hole High School, and now extended to ten other Wyoming schools that will teach students the skills needed to become Certified Microsoft Technicians."
Jackson Hole High School is the first in America to host such an innovative partnership.
The young people who participate in this project have strong prospects of high paying jobs immediately out of high school or they can go on to advanced training at Central Wyoming College.
"The second success story involves Powell High School, Northwest Community College and a consortium of 16 of our smaller schools around the state."
They focus on learning the skills needed in the field of Graphics and Visual Communications by working to meet standards set by the businesses and industries that will eventually hire them.
Our communities clearly say that they want only certain types of new business development.
But there’s no definition or focus.
"In response, several of our best existing businesses in Wyoming have offered to provide financial support to develop a Wyoming Business Plan, and have pledged $40,000 as front-end money to develop the plan."
I’m asking for state support to match their pledge.
"We will direct the effort with a Governor’s Business Council which will finally bring together all the various boards and committees that oversee what is at best, a fragmented approach to business development today."
"Wyoming’s economy depends upon our natural resources, including development of those resources."
"Our quality of life depends upon our open spaces, scenic lands and healthy environment."
"As the demands for both resource development and resource protection grow, it is more and more difficult to maintain the balance."
Yet Wyoming people can create innovative solutions through collaborative processes.
I have hosted a number of Partnership conferences geared toward bringing people together to develop solutions.
"I am committed to the assurance of access to these resources, in particular, resources managed by the federal government, not only for recreation, agriculture and mineral development, but, above all, access to the decision making process."
Decisions made by the federal government impact our communities and our economy.
"Well over half of our economy depends upon the wisdom and guidance of one federal cabinet official, the Secretary of the Interior."
"In the spirit of cooperation and collaboration, I yesterday extended my personal invitation to the Secretary to visit Wyoming so that we might resolve his disagreements with the Wyoming approach to the RAC.It’s time to work together."
Community Focus Several of the issues of this session focus on the strength of our communities.
"We have talked about the role that local leaders play in establishing economic goals, delivering the best education and reforming welfare programs."
I also support a return to community values as well when it comes to providing care and treatment for young people and the mentally ill.
"Welfare Reform For the past two years, Wyoming along with the other states, has been working to bring people programs back to the states where they belong."
"The Governors voted unanimously one year ago, on specific proposals for low income health care, or Medicaid, Welfare Reform and Workforce Development, and how they could best be transferred back to the states without federal mandates attached."
The best intentions only yielded one of the three.
Welfare reform passed late last summer and now we want to be sure to properly assume a Wyoming approach to implementing the act.
Wyoming’s focus will be to move away from a social entitlement toward developing work centered opportunities geared toward providing independence.
"We need to encourage people to understand that the assistance will be temporary, with the federally imposed limit of five years on benefits."
There will still be a safety net for those who can’t meet the new standards.
Federal law does not count higher education as a qualification for receiving benefits unless the recipient is also working at least part time.
That’s in conflict with the Wyoming law passed last year that allows benefits to be paid for students.
"Because students did rely on the promise of last year’s law, I used my executive authority to extend benefits for qualified recipients through this spring semester."
Now it’s time to reevaluate our statute on higher education benefits.
Last year’s Wyoming law essentially determines that a welfare recipient who pursues higher education and skill training without working is entitled to welfare benefits.That is rather extraordinary.
No other segment of our population is given an entitlement for support while going to college.
"To guarantee benefits to one small group is unfair to the other citizens of the State who struggle daily to contribute to their own, or their children’s higher education."
"Wyoming’s welfare reform program that is centered on self sufficiency and work can give a big boost through health care, child care and education benefits, but individual initiative must be the focus."
"Every qualifying individual who needs assistance will be helped to develop their own unique plan that will guide them to a reasonable opportunity for employment at a reasonable wage, including a higher education degree through individual effort."
"The success of welfare reform and along with it, workforce development that I mentioned earlier will depend on how efficiently we organize state efforts and spend the funds."
Each agency has a part of the solution.
"I ask you for the authority to reorganize functions and programs of the Departments of Education, Employment, and Family Services with support from Health and the Community colleges."
We need consistent policies without duplication and overlap.
We need consolidation and reassignment of functions to the agency with the most expertise in specific areas.
Final recommendations will be available during next year’s budget session for your review and approval.
Troubled Youth Your Judiciary committees have sponsored a package of bills that would re-direct our treatment of youth at risk to the community level.
I support placing emphasis on personal and family responsibility and using community-based treatment in dealing with our youth who are at risk and those who put others at risk.
"I support tougher sanctions, earlier in the process with juvenile offenders."
"As court ordered placements continue to increase, we need to redirect our current youth treatment programs toward earlier intervention and diversion programs."
The success of education reform in many schools will depend in large part on how we design our programs for troubled and troubling youth.
Mental Health I support the proposals of the Select Committee and Partnership on Mental Health to improve delivery of services in Wyoming.
The recommendations are an excellent first step toward improving the system of care and avoiding litigation.
"The recommendations will provide for additional services in the form of intensive case management, psychiatric services, a Supported Independent Program in Fremont County and strengthening of the substance abuse residential programs."
"However, my support is conditioned upon targeting services to seriously and persistently mentally ill adults and seriously emotionally disturbed (SED) children as its first priority; and providers must be fully accountable with service based on measurable results."
Some of the reform to improve and resolve issues pertaining to SED children and adolescents overlaps initiatives for Juvenile Justice.
These actions are being coordinated to avoid duplication and assure proper service.
Public Safety I support two bills that are designed to get tougher with those who drink and drive.
One bill would lower the blood alcohol content that defines legal intoxication to .08.
Another bill would toughen up our open container laws.
"It’s time to send a message, particularly to our young people, that drinking and driving don’t mix under any circumstance."
I support legislation that would require convicted Wyoming felons to submit blood samples for inclusion in state and national databases on DNA.
We are already connected to automated identification systems.
All that’s needed is the authority to share DNA information with other states’ law enforcement agencies.
Wyoming is not isolated from increases in violent crime and illegal drug activity.
We must continue to prevent illegal drugs and their impact on our youth.
Drug prevention education must be available in all of our schools.
Early intervention programs must be available to individuals --youth or adult who fall prey to this terrible problem.
"And finally, we must commit to continuing an aggressive interdiction and enforcement effort to send a strong message that illegal drugs are not tolerated in Wyoming."
Corrections I strongly urge approval this session for construction of the prison.
I do not support privatized operation of either the medium or maximum security facilities at Rawlins because the responsibility of secure incarceration and risk management is too serious to consider otherwise.
I remain open to other possibilities that would contract for services within any of our correctional facilities.
The supplemental budget contains a request contract for additional placement of Wyoming felons in out of state facilities.
This addresses the short term need to properly manage the high risk felons in our system.
"Those who can be placed safely in community alternative programs, have been placed."
We are only buying time to build a maximum security facility in-state.
I support revenue bonding to finance construction of the new prison backed by an appropriation to guarantee the bonds.
That leaves the option open to redirect any appropriated funds to any future higher priority for the funds.
Water - our most fundamental renewable resource.
"As downstream neighboring states thirst and the regulatory and policy interests of the federal government increase, so must our defense of our rights to use water in Wyoming."
"Governor Ben Nelson and I have successfully resolved several minor issues regarding the North Platte River, but a full settlement is still elusive."
I support the funding request from the Attorney General and the State Engineer as sponsored by the Select Water Committee for both the North Platte settlement and the Big Horn River general adjudication.
"I also support the funds recommended in the 1997 Omnibus Water Bill for a comprehensive water plan to define our needs for wildlife interests, economic development, recreation and municipalities, to name a few."
"State Trust Lands Last May, the Legislative Management Council and I appointed a diverse select committee of Wyoming people to address management of the state land trust."
"The Committee’s recommendations address the entire Trust consisting of surface lands, minerals and the Permanent Land Fund."
I respect the difficulty that the Legislature has had in the past to address this issue.
"The proposed bill, which I strongly support, represents a series of compromises."
I urge you to recognize this as you give the bill your careful consideration.
I also propose that some of the policy statements contained in the Select Committee’s report should be incorporated in the pre-filed bill to establish clearly the intent and purpose of the statute.
Mineral Royalties and Markets We need the ability to market our resources at the highest available price.
I am supporting legislation that will authorize the State to take its share of any federal mineral royalties in-kind rather than in cash.
We need legislation to allow this option.
Then we can receive a higher return on mineral production and develop the opportunity to assist our independent producers in their marketing efforts.
"We can work together to aggregate production, put it out to bid with transporters and buyers, and enjoy the benefits of higher income from smarter marketing."
Taxes We have strong pressures for new spending with revenues we don’t have under a revenue system that isn’t very dependable.
"I view my obligation as Governor to outline as, best I can, the areas that may need new funding and the possible sources of those funds."
"We hear of the need for infrastructure maintenance and construction, with proposals for our highways, new state lab, the Barrett building, youth facilities, the new prison, both construction and operation, social services for youth treatment and mental health, education, K-12 and higher ed, but I am not convinced that we actually need new taxes."
It’s still possible that redistribution is the proper remedy.
I believe we should consider the issue of highway infrastructure along with other state services and responsibilities.
"The fourth cent sales tax is scheduled to expire in July 1998, the beginning of the next biennial budget period."
It was originally adopted to increase funding for education.
I recommend that we defer action on ALL tax and revenue issues until the special session this summer when we will have a much clearer picture of what will be necessary to adequately fund K-12 education.
I make that recommendation particularly since we now have some breathing room provided by the unexpected increase in the CREG report.
We can use the time between now and then to assess those needs against other priorities.
We should send a message to our taxpayers that we don’t take tax issues lightly.
"We need a comprehensive look at all new spending, a clearer look at priorities and a fresh look at the Wyoming revenue system, both state and local."
"I do not support any increase in taxes as the solution, but I do support a review of generally accepted principles of good state tax policy as a means to increase stability and enhance our planning process."
"Closing Well, there you have it."
"That’s not all of our state of the State, but it’s enough to get us started toward significant reforms on important issues."
"I will continue our efforts for better planning, improved coordination and prioritization of programs."
"We must constantly choose only those things that government SHOULD do, and not all of what government COULD do."
I look forward to a productive partnership with you and our fellow citizens as we discharge our obligations and achieve our dreams.Thank You !
