As we write the final chapter in the history of the twentieth century, we need to remind ourselves who we are as a people, the struggles we have faced and what we can learn from our collective experience.
As we know, those who fail to heed the lessons of history are condemned to repeat its mistakes.
We were molded in the crucible of the Civil War.
Our state was created by Abraham Lincoln, whose birth and life we honor today.
In the years that followed, West Virginia confronted the challenges of industrialization, deindustrialization, global wars, regional conflicts, great depression and a succession of man-made and natural disasters.
We have been tested as few people in the nation have ever been tested.
For too long in our history, we have been divided by ancient conflicts pitting one group against another, one region against another and one value system against another.
We have paid a dear price for these divisions.
They have sapped our vitality, our wealth and our opportunities.
Now we can chart a different course, one built on mutual respect, compromise and consensus.
We can enter the twenty-first century renewed in spirit and self-confidence, if we choose to learn from our past and to escape its imprisonment.
Tonight, I challenge all of us in this magnificent structure and all West Virginians regardless of rank or station to work together for the common good.
In recent years, important steps have been taken in a positive cooperative direction.
I commend my predecessor, Governor Gaston Caperton, and the members of this Legislature, on both sides of the aisle, who have put the welfare of West Virginia above partisan political advantage.
Much of our progress is directly related to your efforts.
While I am proud to be a Republican, I am first and foremost a West Virginian.
I will walk the extra mile to work with anyone for the betterment of our beloved state.
In this same spirit, I challenge the press and media of this state to report honestly and accurately the work of government, to criticize when it is warranted, but not to ignore the many significant accomplishments of this government and the vitally important private sector.
We cannot progress as a people in a climate of cynicism that results in the continuous promotion of a negative image.
We should be justly proud of our human and natural resources, and we should let the rest of the world know that we have pride and self-respect.
If we want others to come here to live, to invest, to create jobs and to strengthen our communities, we must be positive about our own state.
In the last decade, omnibus reform measures have been enacted in elementary and secondary education, higher education, workers compensation, environmental regulation, health care, corrections, ethics and infrastructure.
These complicated but necessary reforms have occurred at a bewildering pace.
Our time is a different time -- one not driven by crisis but by challenges of a different magnitude, but no less daunting.
Now we need a new vision of government and a new model of government --not more government, but better government.
We need a government that trains, motivates, empowers and rewards its employees -- one that uses technology to a maximum advantage.
We need a government that manages its own paperwork and doesn't get buried in it.
We see obsolete government all about us.
At this very moment, in critically important agencies, we lack basic data essential for sound decision making.
We have databases that are incompatible, we have programs that have spun out of control with little or no financial accountability and we have asked state employees to carry sometimes impossible workloads without the tools to get the job done.
Look at this story in Monday morning's paper.
Your legislative audit confirms that nearly $2 million were spent to help develop a system for state caseworkers to assess allegations of child abuse or neglect.
Yet, the system was used less than half the time.
"Your auditor said that the system had ""a total lack of management information concerning performance in the county offices."
In short, our government is failing in the essential task of protecting its most vulnerable children.
Unfortunately, we see far too many instances like this to ensure public confidence in what we are doing.
I'm afraid if we were judged by the competitive realities of the private sector, we would be found wanting.
I know that state government has many dedicated and resourceful workers.
They often work without proper support, training and appreciation, but we cannot ignore the glaringly obvious need for change.
We can and we must do better.
Tonight, I call for a revolution in government.
I will devote the talent, time and will of this administration to this task.
We will put far less emphasis on passing new laws and far more emphasis on making the old ones work.
The steps that we must take to revolutionize government are not easy -- they cannot be accomplished by simple cosmetic changes.
I have very carefully selected the new cabinet with the due deliberation that these very important offices deserve.
The individuals are experienced not just in their respective fields, but in the science of management.
They are leaders with proven administrative capability.
Their foremost task is to modernize our government and make it more efficient.
And you and the people of this state will surely hold us accountable.
I propose to create a chief technology officer as an integral part of the Governor's office with government-wide authority to affect changes.
A supplemental budget will request the office of information and technology to be moved from the secretary of administration to the governor's office.
This officer will be responsible for: Statewide technology standards; Coordination of cross-agency technology programs; Identification of technology needs and opportunities; Standardizing information systems procurement specifications; and Dealing with the impact of the Year 2000 problem to state computer systems.
This new office will not be some blue sky, think tank.
Its job will be to find practical solutions to the everyday problems of government.
It will solve problems from the perspective of the public who receive services, not the government that provides them.
The Legislature created the Science and Technology Commission last year with broad powers.
The chief technology officer will work with this commission to build a statewide Intranet for use by state and local governments, by private sector businesses and private citizens.
We will use academic and private sector research people to seek new technologies that bring new products and new services, which in turn build new businesses with new jobs.
I will ask you to approve legislation that strengthens our present personnel division and transforms it into a fully integrated human resource program, which will include the Center for Quality Government.
The director will be charged with responsibility to establish a government-wide human resource program that will enable all state employees to participate in this revolution of government.
We must change the culture of government by setting higher standards of performance and then rewarding results.
It is now time to involve the private sector in those specific areas where it can do the job in a better, more cost effective way, while protecting state workers who would not otherwise leave government through attrition or retirement.
The problems we face are systemic.
They exist to one degree or another in every department and agency.
The task of reform is therefore enormous, and we cannot solve the problems overnight.
We will begin immediately and we will work every single day to accomplish our purpose.
Beyond the challenge of revolutionizing government, none is greater than the education of our citizenry.
Our future will be determined by our commitment.
In this task we cannot fail.
Substantial progress has been achieved in the last decade.
In the Jan 22 issue of Education Week, the state is ranked near the top in several major categories of performance.
West Virginia is ranked number one in the nation in effort -- the financial investment made relative to per capita wealth.
We are also ranked second in the nation in equity---the measure of the equality of per-pupil spending.
We are second in the nation in the use of computers for teaching and learning.
We have become a national leader in some very important measures of educational quality.
I am determined to build upon this solid foundation.
Even in years of limited resources, education must remain our first and foremost priority.
Accordingly, I will submit a budget to you that includes an additional $32 million for the state Teachers Retirement System in order to keep the fund solvent and protect our improving bond rating.
We made a commitment to teachers and service personnel and we simply must honor it.
We cannot afford to fund this system and also provide a pay raise for our school employees this year.
To do so would have been irresponsible and would have returned us to a practice of ignoring our obligations to the retirement system in favor of what would have been politically expedient.
We have made the responsible choice not to underfund the Teachers Retirement System in order to provide modest raises soon to be eroded as future dollars would be required to shore up a faltering retirement system.
Last year, this Legislature enacted Senate Bill 300, the Jobs Through Education Act, which is designed to create greater employment awareness and career understanding by students.
I have included modest funding in the budget to assist the counties in the development of school plans to support the preparation for the changes in curriculum contemplated by this act.
The Education Week study indicates that we need to improve the preparation of teachers.
For years, this essential responsibility has floundered between the state Board of Education and the higher education system.
Now it is time to forget about turf and concentrate on teaching.
Tonight, I challenge both systems to work to improve teacher training -- to raise and toughen entrance standards, to require more subject matter concentration and to require the post baccalaureate study be concentrated in the teachers' discipline.
The Center for Professional Development must focus its programs on school management, academic excellence, and adapting its programs to the local needs of each county.
I believe that better teacher preparation, especially for middle and high school teachers, and better training for principals who are the managers of our schools, are the keys to improved student performance.
Finally, let me say a word to parents and grandparents.
All the great teachers, all the computers and all the educational resources in the world are doomed to failure if we do not send our children to school determined to learn and succeed.
The state's responsibility ends at your front door.
You must be our enthusiastic partners.
Enrich children with computers instead of cars, books instead of video games and encourage them to do their best every day.
I will submit to you legislation to merge the West Virginia College of Graduate Studies with Marshall University making the Graduate College a division of Marshall University.
I am convinced that this merger will consolidate educational programs, reduce duplication and result in a wise expenditure of state dollars.
This merger and the recent merger of West Virginia University and West Virginia Institute of Technology should serve as models for our other institutions of higher education.
The budget document before you provides the additional funding to meet the higher education salary targets set forth in Senate Bill 347.
This 3.25 percent increase honors a past commitment to implement fully the salary schedule for classified staff and to bring faculty salaries to the 95 percent target of the Southern Regional Educational Board.
The budget includes funding for the Higher Education Grant Program which you had the foresight to fund at a higher level last year.
This program has given thousands of West Virginians the opportunity to get a higher education that otherwise would have been denied.
Frankly, it is my favorite program of opportunity, and if additional dollars become available, I recommend increased support for this program.
The health care world is undergoing rapid change with new and revised federal programs, mandates, changing delivery and management systems.
But we can no longer blame the focus outside our control for the problems that we face within our control.
I am dedicated to make the Department of Health and Human Resources a modern, professional, accountable operation.
I will join with the cabinet staff to make this agency work.
The secretary will report soon those functions of the department that warrant greater private sector participation.
We have received many recommendations, especially in the area of Child Protective Services and Behavioral Health.
I will await this report, however, before recommending further action.
We will undertake plans to create a new swipe card system for Medicaid recipients.
This new technology will assist in detecting and eliminating fraud and analyzing patterns of utilization.
The swipe card will help us manage better this massive program.
I will also ask you to establish the Health Care Cost Review Authority as the central data bank for the systematic collection and organization of all pertinent health care information.
This step is essential to develop an accountable health care delivery system.
With the reauthorization legislation for HCCRA currently before you, it is now time to reassess the purpose and function of this agency.
The realities of the health care system have changed appreciably since HCCRA was created.
Accordingly, I will present to you, comprehensive recommendations regarding HCCRA, so that we can redefine this agency’s role in this session of the Legislature.
I would respectfully ask for your indulgence until we can present those recommendations to you.
In the next two years, West Virginia will feel the full force of the Federal Welfare Reform Act.
We must intensify our efforts to meet the challenges presented by this federal mandate in a rural state of traditionally high unemployment.
We must identify those welfare recipients who can work and place them on a statewide job registry and match their skills with employment opportunities in the private sector.
I call upon the business community to join us in this challenge.
We must create jobs.
In recent years we have had an improving economy in West Virginia.
Major new industries have located here, and we have experienced expansion of existing business and the start-up of thousands of small businesses.
Obviously, the public/private initiative is working and is worthy of our continuing support.
Our unemployment rate is the lowest in years but still too high.
We have a legitimate basis for optimism, but our success is neither guaranteed nor inevitable.
It depends, in substantial part, on the decisions we make and how we manage this government.
I believe we can take specific and concrete steps to grow our economy and create good paying jobs.
We must continue to improve the infrastructure.
Forty years ago I stood in this very chamber and advocated what was considered impossible, the construction of a network of four-lane highways throughout the state.
Tonight, I am here to tell you that I am dedicated to completing that task.
In this session of the Legislature we have the responsibility to carry out the mandate of the electorate by enacting legislation to implement our recently approved road bond amendment.
President Clinton's Fiscal Year '98 budget calls for funding of the federal share for the completion of Corridor H, the Parkersburg Bypass and Corridor G. I will work with the congressional delegation to ensure maximum federal participation.
Additionally, it is time to make a determined commitment to build the southern coal expressway and to explore the possibility of using Parkways funds and other funding for this project.
This step is essential to develop and diversify the economy of the southern coal fields and it is certainly time to make this project a top priority, along with Route 2 on our western border and Route 9 in our Eastern Panhandle.
In conjunction with the development of our highway network, I am initiating an aggressive and intensive effort with both the private and public sectors to identify potential Crossroads of Commerce critical to our economic future.
Those crossroads are defined by the Interstate and Appalachian Highway systems.
I will seek your support to provide water and sewage infrastructure where large tracts of land are available for potential development, and I will work with the private sector to encourage capital formation and investment in these important growth opportunities.
The key to West Virginia's economic expansion is directly related to infrastructure development.
I need only point to foresight in planning for the construction of the Toyota plant in Putnam County, as an example.
If the county officials who built their water system had not had the foresight to install adequate water lines along the north side of the river, it is questionable whether Toyota could have chosen that location.
I will support the development of a regional transpark somewhere near the Charleston-Huntington corridor.
This project will satisfy the dual purpose of providing greatly improved air passenger service and a companion industrial and shipping capability to generate growth and jobs.
This project affords an excellent opportunity for a public-private development partnership.
It is another big step to develop an integrated transportation infrastructure, and take full advantage of the opportunity to locate supporting industries for the new Toyota engine plant.
This regional transpark will also ensure our children and grandchildren the ability to be competitive in an ever-expanding world market.
We must reach out for global opportunities.
Initially, expenditures for a trade office in Nagoya, Japan, were questioned.
Now, however, the office has proved its value many times.
Since the opening of the office, we have grown from one Japanese company to 11 and, since 1990, more than $1 billion has been invested here.
Three weeks ago, I participated via satellite teleconference, with Senator Rockefeller and a delegation of West Virginia business and education leaders in the dedication of a new office in Taipei, Taiwan, where similar beneficial results can be obtained.
I have also directed the office of economic development to explore similar opportunities in Europe and Canada.
I call your attention to an age-old problem in West Virginia, our tendency to export our raw materials and natural resources to other states and nations, only to have others add value and sell us the finished product at handsome profits.
We have all watched the trucks and freight cars loaded with timber, coal and chemical products roll out of state.
Recently, in the mid Ohio Valley, a Polymer Alliance Zone has been created as a not for profit organization designed to encourage manufacturers using plastics to locate near the source of their main ingredient.
I will recommend additional funding in the budget to assist in this effort, and I will work with other regional non-profit organizations to develop similar entities around industries where we enjoy a strategic advantage such as steel, timber and high technology.
Authoritative studies prove that the timber industry has tremendous value added potential.
I see no reason why West Virginia timber cannot be crafted into furniture and other finished wood products sold to the world.
I am a strong advocate of investing modest public dollars to create business incubators with ready-made buildings, access roads and utilities to invite wood products manufacturers to West Virginia where they are near the best hardwoods in the world and often closer to their markets.
Our message is simple -- bring your equipment and we will supply you with the necessary infrastructure and the most dedicated work force in the world.
I recommend that the first of these incubators be built in southern West Virginia and the second in the northern highlands.
Building on our strengths and adding value to the resources we produce is another key to growing our economy.
Let me provide you with an example from one of our bedrock industries, which is rapidly undergoing the transformation to a high technology industry.
In the next five years, an estimated 2,500 workers will retire from our chemical industry.
Will they be replaced or will the industry move on to what is considered greener pastures?
We can retain these 2,500 jobs and add additional ones if we send clear and unmistakable signals that our government wants growth and values the contribution the chemical industry makes to our economy.
This industry is vital to our economy, and we must ensure that the decision makers, some of whom live in foreign countries, understand that their facilities are welcome in West Virginia.
We have a unique opportunity to add value to our coal and natural gas industries by taking advantage of the restructuring of the electric utility industry brought on by deregulation.
Already, West Virginia power plants are contracting with utilities in other states to generate electricity for them.
"This ""mine mouth"" generation concept gives West Virginia an opportunity to become the ""energy state of the east."
We must ensure we maintain a regulatory atmosphere that allows us to take full advantage of this opportunity.
West Virginia's greatest resource is its people.
By providing training for our work force, we have become partners with business, and the Governor's Guaranteed Work Force Program has trained more than 43,000 West Virginians for new job opportunities.
Businesses have praised this program for the quality of the workers and the timeliness of their training.
Due to the tremendous success of this program and because it is an investment in our people, I am requesting an increase of $1.4 million to expand the training.
I have also provided an additional $300,000 for the new Small Business Work Force Program.
It is time to undertake a systematic review of the program of incentives used to create jobs.
It will be our goal to invest, wherever practicable, in hard assets.
To attract and grow certain industries such as high technology and telecommunications, we must use tax credits in their traditional form to be competitive.
In economic development, our purpose is simple and straightforward.
"My mission statement says it best, ""We are dedicated to growing the economy and enhancing the quality of life for every West Virginian."
Economic growth is not an end in itself.
It is not a golden idol to be worshiped.
Instead, it is a means to provide employment at wages and benefits that support families and provide reasonable standards of living.
We can and will grow our economy, and we can do it in a manner that protects the natural beauty and God-given endowments of our state.
We can do it with a government that is modern, manageable and accountable and never forgets that all of us who have the public’s trust are here as servants, not masters.
The budget that I submit for your consideration is based on a revenue estimate of $2.438 billion and includes no tax increases or fee increases.
The estimate is $75.6 million over the estimate for the current fiscal year.
The increased revenue will be concentrated in the following areas: $39 million for public education to pay for the experience increment for teachers and service personnel, teacher’s retirement and the Public Employees Insurance match; nearly $7 million for programmatic increases in Health and Human Resources; $8 million for corrections and State Police salaries and retirement; and nearly $3.5 million for the public defender system.
From increased lottery net profits, I recommend $2.5 million for the Computer Basic Skills program.
This budget and the limitations that it imposes, clearly demonstrate the importance of economic growth.
It is the only reasonable way we can provide the additional revenue to fund the very important public priorities we all want.
Together, we can create a Revolution that will bring about New Times in West Virginia---New Times built on bipartisan cooperation---New Times that stress mutual respect for business and labor---New Times committed to education and health care---New Times that will create a modern, efficient government.
