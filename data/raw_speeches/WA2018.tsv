And I believe that Washington is exactly the state to lead the clean-energy economy and seize the jobs that China and other nations are clamoring for.
This is who we are.
We create, we invent, we build.
And the people of Washington are ready to create, invent, and build the carbon-free future our children and grandchildren deserve.

Not just in Germany.
Not just in B. C. here.
