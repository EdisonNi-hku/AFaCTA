SENTENCES
"Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
"President Grieve, Mr. Chief Justice and fellow Justices, Members of the 54th Legislature, fellow elected officials, Tribal leaders, First Lady Sherri, and all other folks in Wyoming.Good Morning!"
I thank Lisa Dignan for letting me do the spoken part of the State of the State address today!
Thank you for your interpretation!
"Introduction By the Grace of God and the People of Wyoming, it is my honor and privilege to report to you on the State of the State of Wyoming."
"I am responsible for speaking to you about the condition of our state in general, and about the state of our governing tasks in particular."
"One hundred and twenty nine years ago, Governor John A. Campbell addressed the opening of the First Legislative Assembly of Wyoming Territory."
"In part he said, ""The duties devolving upon you are arduous and of the most important character that will probably fall to any legislative assembly convened during our Territorial organization."
"Coming together as the pioneers of a future State, I trust that this initial point in our history will be marked by no personal dissensions, no mere partisan schemes and no local jealousies, but that we may work unitedly for the common good of the whole Territory, and through it for the good of our whole country.I echo those words today."
"We should approach our duties with interests greater than our own, without partisanship and without local selfish interests."
Our call is to see to the common good of the people of Wyoming.
"And in turn, set an example for the nation."
"I am prepared to list the general accomplishments for our state and give you as well, a list of requests."
"We have been preparing the state's budget for nearly a year, in the midst of considerable uncertainty, but with the end result that we have been blessed with adequate revenues and good opportunities to spend them."
"The key issues of this Legislative Session include Education, the Economy and the Budget."
"I will touch on other issues as well, but these are the big three."
Priorities The major priorities are education and economic development.
"Along with these, I include state employee pay, corrections and youth services as needing extra attention."
"Education We have the task of providing in this session for the immediate needs of our kids, while laying the groundwork for their future."
"This spring over 6,500 seniors will graduate from our high schools."
What kind of preparation have we provided for them?
What will their job prospects be?
Equally significant is the fact that over six thousand kindergartners will start school next fall.
What will we do this session for them when they receive their diplomas in the year 2011?
At least half of the jobs that will be available in the year 2010 haven't even been invented yet.
The work begun in last June Special Session established clearly that the state is solidly behind high standards and tough accountability.
Together we set a goal of keeping pace with business trends and the urgent need for distance learning.
Proper use of productive technology remains a high priority.
Today the assessment of student competency is secondary to time spent in class.
Seat time takes higher precedence than measuring achievement.
And technology is the huge untapped resource that needs a home in the delivery of American education and workforce development.
"We need Standards, Assessment, Technology and Accountability!"
"Education reform must include our continuing commitment to tougher standards, better basic education in fundamentals, keeping local control, and expanded use of technology to open up the world to our young people."
"You made a strong commitment to student assessment, technology and accountability last summer.Don't abandon it now!"
K-12 Spending Overshadowing all budget requests is the additional funding for K-12 public education.
"Based on requirements authorized by the special session of the Legislature last June, the net increase in the State's obligation over the last biennial budget baseline will be approximately $83 million per year, or $166 million for the biennium."
"Again that's a $166 million increase in the State's obligation from two years ago, for public school funding."
Local district obligations have been reduced.
"However, the net new money to the schools is only $102.4 million, which includes $29 million for technology."
Supreme Court Criteria The Supreme Court decision offered both a challenge and an opportunity.
"In declaring the current school funding system unconstitutional, the Court's demand of the State was to demonstrate equity of opportunity in our schools and then fund it."
The Court directed two basic items: Define the minimum threshold of education needed for Wyoming's children and fund it out of state sources of funds.
No part of the basic package of education should be funded out of local optional resources.
Develop a system of distribution of funds that is founded on a rational and documented system.
"The previous system did not have a documented rationale, which the Court found to be the most significant omission."
The work done to date by the Legislature has met the criteria set down by the Court.
Most significant has been the recent decision that the MAP model is a cost based model capable of resolving the remaining issues.
Actions for this Session Issues that remain for your consideration are: Transportation Defining necessary small schools Regional cost of living adjustments Maintenance cost adjustments Special education Capital construction Technology plans and preparation Assessment I am concerned that the focus is no longer on student achievement but only on how much money will go where.
The sole criteria at many of the recent working meetings has been how much more money can we add?
We must turn our attention to the fundamental issue of results.
What will our children gain after all this is done?
Will we know if the effort has produced results?
I am convinced that we are on the road to real and substantive reform that could benefit both taxpayers and students alike.
We need to proceed with an attitude of cooperation and set aside litigation.
Our efforts in school management still need to assure both local control and business involvement.
Business must be involved with our schools from curriculum development to job training programs.
Parents must be involved to assure that students are ready to learn and to hold their schools accountable.
"Business is the end user of the product delivered by the schools, well prepared kids."
And business will continue to be the single largest source of school revenues.
"Accordingly, we must push for accountability in achievement by our students and in responsibility in how the monies are spent."
"Attitude Adjustment Even though there are strong arguments that some new funds are needed, the fundamental constitutional system of three branches of government still exists in Wyoming."
Only the Legislature can raise taxes and only the Legislature can appropriate funds.
The attempts by plaintiff attorneys in September to provoke a manufactured crisis with a strategy to shut down the schools didn't work.
Judge Kalokathis ruled that there is a compelling state interest in keeping the schools open while the Legislature continues its next steps of finance reform.
The driving force has been the Supreme Court decision brought about by the plaintiff districts.
It's time to quit litigating and start educating!
"For all the money spent on litigation, particularly at the local level, we have millions of education dollars that don't even come close to getting into the classroom!"
Technology I am pleased to report significant progress on effective use of technology for our schools.
"We have a variety of state, regional and local initiatives."
Education Management Group from Phoenix has teamed up with ten of our smaller school districts to provide teacher training and course development.
"EMG provides the satellite dish, the school connections and the content."
"Central Wyoming College received a $10 million Star Schools grant to aid another dozen schools as they move into modern technology and teacher development U S West Partnership will greatly expand our telecommunications capacity and will benefit education, local government, law enforcement, economic development and our communities."
"IBM, the University of Wyoming and the state Department of Education have designed a pilot project to determine the most effective way to incorporate new teaching methods along with technology improvements NETDAY is a wonderful effort involving communities and their schools."
The state technology initiative will only bring connections to each school.
Inside connections need to be installed and distribution networks set up.
"We just had an old fashioned barn raising in Glenrock that brought students, teachers, parents, business people and other community leaders together to help their local school."
It's a great way to build community spirit and support!
A private company in Park County has donated over two hundred thousand dollars worth of computer equipment for the schools with one condition.
That all students and teachers sign a commitment to be drug free.
"With the momentum that is building for school improvement, I strongly support keeping the state's funding in place for technology."
My budget request includes $24 million for the next step toward the $40 million goal that you set last year.
Post High School Education and Training.
Wyoming's young people deserve access to education beyond the public schools.
We have a great opportunity for our kids who want to go on to college or to pursue specialized education and training in a specific career or skill.
"Over the past year, we've made great progress in bringing our community colleges, the University of Wyoming, the Department of Employment, the State Department of Education and the Department of Family Services together to come up with good plans that work together for all young people."
Don't give in to the temptation to pit our institutions against each other.
Our state's economic development future depends upon an educated workforce which will help retain and attract new and more diverse business.
"All of our educational institutions, from K-12 to community colleges to the University, are funded through a concept we call a ""block grant."
"Just as your work in public schools struggles to properly adjust the block grant for K-12 education, we have to adjust for the realities of higher education."
I have recommended salary adjustments to keep up with the competition for quality faculty and staff and to reflect the goal you set four years ago to maintain salaries at 90 percent of market for these positions.
"Our University deserves our strong support, from all parts of the state."
"Our new President, Phil Dubois, is very clear that the University will serve all of Wyoming, not just those counties that are nearby."
His proposals to join community needs with University capabilities are new and refreshing.
The new enthusiasm to help our public school teachers through the College of Education is long overdue.
"The focused research through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, or EPSCoR is building on a recent record of extraordinary achievement."
We need to maintain that momentum.
Our community colleges have become the focus for regional activity in economic and community development.
They will serve as the regional centers for support of new technology that must be carefully guided as it works its way into our public schools.
They are the center of workforce training as businesses look for qualified training for new workers.
"Our Workforce Development Council has taken several uncoordinated and somewhat ineffective programs that deal with vocational training and skill upgrades, and molded them into a much more effective program to help people get better jobs and employers to get better employees."
The work of the council with the leadership of Frank Galeotos and Alfrieda Gonzales is much more focused on the needs of the community and the goals of the students.
"Past programs were ineffective, as they usually focused only on the supply side."
"Economy But after even the best education in America, where will our young people end up?"
We must provide job opportunities so that our young people will not have to leave Wyoming but can choose to stay with the prospects of a bright future.
We still export nearly two thirds of our best and brightest young citizens.
Let me send a clear message to our young graduates.
WE WANT YOU TO STAY IN WYOMING if that's what you would choose!
We DON'T want you to have to leave just to find a career!
Wyoming's economy must be more diverse with growth in information processing and technology related companies.
Workforce skills have changed dramatically away from basic literacy and physical strength to the present need for complex technical skills and continuing skill upgrades.
Wyoming has not participated in the strong regional growth of recent years.
"We have grown slightly, but at a rate slower than nearly all of our neighbors."
"For over a decade, we have heard the cry for diversification and a call for getting away from dependence on mineral income."
"Indeed, we must diversify our economy and our tax structure."
Do the people of Wyoming want economic growth?
I can say with certainty that the majority answer is YES!
But the type of growth varies by region and even by community.
"All states, including Wyoming, have residents who don't want growth."
That points out the importance of state support of local leadership.
Do I think that the Legislature is going to fund big increases for economic activities?No.
"Not unless there is a clear plan based upon three principles - quality, accountability, and measurable impact."
Our goal would be to establish a clear direction for state economic development efforts which are shared and supported by community leaders statewide.
And to encourage and support local efforts in Wyoming communities as they define and design themselves.
Statewide Economic Development Actions We must clearly define what state and local government should do and provide a state advocacy for select areas of growth.
"For too long, we've let our expectations outrun our actions."
Jobs don't come from the state or any level of government.
Jobs still come from employers who are willing to work hard and manage risk well.
Last year you authorized a Business Steering Committee to develop a new approach to the State's role in economic growth.
"Their work was delivered to your Joint Minerals, Business, and Economic Development Committee last November."
"The committee designed a plan with strategies and programs proven successful in other states, but adapted to Wyoming's unique conditions."
The plan is based upon a dynamic private and public partnership.
"It is innovative and action-oriented, and will stimulate economic development."
Six components represent a comprehensive frame for Wyoming's economic development strategy.
They are interdependent and must be pursued simultaneously.
1) Competitive People Quality of the Workforce - Human capital is our most significant asset for improving Wyoming's future.
The excellence of our public education system is of paramount importance.
The entire educational system must be aware of what business needs and of what students' goals are.
Community Leadership Development and Resources - Local officials and civic leaders are challenged with a wide variety of complex development issues.
"The Committee's statewide survey revealed that local leaders, communities and development groups need external sources of financial and technical expertise."
Governor Ed Schafer of North Dakota and I are working on a joint project called Centers of Excellence in Rural America to develop technical centers in at least two home towns in each of our states to demonstrate how technology might integrate an entire community.
"We have been working with Powell and Lusk to determine what we might do that would guide the way for other communities to integrate citizen involvement, libraries, health care, schools and businesses in a way to help economic growth and community development."
Role of Post-High School Education and Training - The University of Wyoming and the seven community colleges are important assets for Wyoming's economic development.
"Our higher education system has not been fully integrated into the state's development strategies, but needs to be."
"Perhaps the comments of University of Wyoming President, Philip L. Dubois, summarize this most clearly, ""There is little the University can do in the absence of a clear and coherent state economic development strategy backed by sufficient resources and long-term commitment to give it any chance of success."
"2) Competitive Businesses -- To grow and prosper, Wyoming businesses must have a supportive, pro-active business climate that encourages investment and growth."
"Taxation - A stable and competitive tax environment encourages businesses to invest in people, facilities, equipment, and their communities."
Enlightened tax reform must balance the impact among all economic sectors.
"Inadequate public revenue limits the state's ability to shape its future, educate its students, provide essential services, and improve the quality of life of its citizens."
The Tax Reform 2000 Commission has that as a specific charge.
Workers' Compensation has already set a strong precedent by lowering assessments twice in the past two years.
Worker safety has improved substantially and employers have more money left in their businesses.
Over $17 million per year is now staying with employers that previously was being collected by the state.$17 million per year.
"Regulation - Business deserves professional service from state officials who seek to facilitate and solve business problems, not act as obstacles."
"Without sacrificing regulatory integrity, or environmental quality, regulatory customer service needs to be improved in this state."
Our Department of Environmental Quality has set up the Small Business Outreach Program to help our businesses understand state and federal regulations and provide a positive incentive to comply.
"Capital Formation - Profits, growth, and market potential all drive a company's ability to generate capital -- either from equity or debt sources."
"In a state that isn't growing and in an economy that isn't expanding, these three elements may be missing."
There is a role for Wyoming in providing financial assistance to fuel development.
Development Incentives - Wyoming has so few taxes on most business (i. e. no corporate income tax) that many standard incentives utilized by other states are not even possible.
"Carefully applied public incentives can act as a catalyst, leverage private resources, target investment in desired economic sectors, and close deals."
"3) Competitive Communities -- The term ""competitive community"" signifies a community prepared to compete in the global economy in terms of leadership, business, and infrastructure."
4) Infrastructure Development --Wyoming needs to maintain and upgrade its traditional infrastructure.
"Communications infrastructure must remain a high priority, for it allows us to overcome our geographic isolation."
"5) Diversification and Value-Added Products -- The state needs to take an active role in targeting development in businesses that produce higher value products, and create higher skilled, better paying jobs."
6) Redefined State and Private Sector Roles --Wyoming can't develop the way other states have - there is no other leadership unit or funding mechanism than the state itself.
A greater investment of people and capital is required to operate on a scale sufficient to ensure success.
Forming effective partnerships with the private sector is one of the most important actions the state can take.
Business Development Strategies 1) Existing Business Development and Recruitment -- The health of Wyoming's existing businesses is a top priority.
"Key business groups with the greatest short-term potential should be addressed, including resource extraction and tourism."
2) Extraction - Short term strategy must include continuing development of our rich mineral resource.
Wyoming continues to be the leading state for coal production.
95 percent of America's trona comes from southwest Wyoming.
We have 1/6 of the nation's natural gas reserves.
"As Wyoming works to diversify its economy, a stable and significant source of employment and revenue is emerging - the world class gas reserves of Southwest Wyoming."
"The Jonah II field for example, is projected to provide $99 million in worker salaries for drilling activities and $38 million in production salaries."
"We could have over 200 new full time jobs with salaries over $40,000 per year."
Key to the development of gas in the region will be the on-going work between the state and federal agencies.
A working group of state and federal environmental officials have been working for the last 18 months to assure a proper approach to air quality issues and proper protection of our Class I airsheds while still allowing development of this important resource.
"3) Entrepreneur and Enterprise Development -- As we restructure our approach to economic growth, let's remember the strength of Wyoming - Our small businesses."
Small Business development with support for entrepreneurs is vital to our growth strategy.
"Today, two thirds of our Wyoming businesses employ 25 people or less."
Ninety- two percent of our businesses employ 100 or less.
4) Community Enhancement -- A careful assessment of community and regional needs is necessary as a first step in improving service delivery at the local level.
"Regional offices staffed by development professionals will assist communities and developers with planning, grant applications, and project management."
Effective Targeting -- One of the fundamental needs of any successful economic development program is to identify targets of economic opportunity.
"Value-Added Resource-Based Firms High-Value, Capital Intensive Manufacturing and Processing Products From and For Existing Companies - Buy from each other before going out of state Technology and information-based Firms Tourism/Recreation Resources and Product Expansion High-Quality Professional Services - Even lone eagles hire local workers."
Information Technology and Processing Regional Alliances within the state and with other states.
Working to expand the roles and missions of Warren AFB and the Wyo Air Guard.
Working with Utah for the 2002 Olympics.
Greater Yellowstone three-state cooperation.
Implementation Plan Wyoming's critical economic situation calls for bold and decisive action.
The strategy I've outlined cannot be brought to life with Wyoming's current economic development structure and programs.
Wyoming is not operating on a high enough professional level and financial scale to make a difference in the economy.
"Wyoming Business Council -- The structure will be much like that of a corporation, with a board of directors, a central office, regional divisions responsible for operations, professional performance standards, and real world accountability."
The primary function of the central office is to support service delivery within the regions.
The primary functions of each regional office are to provide small business services and community enhancement technical assistance and expertise.
"In order to consolidate operational authority, a number of state boards and authorities will be reviewed and their functions will be assumed by the Council, as appropriate."
A permanent private sector fund or foundation should be created to assist the work of the Council.
"Regional Operations -- Regional delivery systems can provide a more customized approach and more immediate delivery of services, and better address the different mix of economic sectors in each area."
"A regional service delivery plan will need to be developed in close cooperation with local officials, development organizations, and the public."
"State services should complement, not replace, local efforts."
Performance Benchmarks -- The public demand for accountability in economic development has never been more pronounced.
"Three general categories of benchmarks will be measured, with a subset of specific metrics in each."
Operational Benchmarks Economic Performance Benchmarks Quality of Life Benchmarks Wind River Reservation I call your attention to the special needs of the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming.
There the need for new business and jobs is most critical.
Unemployment is 70 percent even in good times.
The tribal leaders here with us today are committed to self-initiated and directed growth.We are in this together.
"We've made good progress in troubling areas, such as court administration, water rights, and welfare reform."
"The Arapaho Tribe has developed a plan to take over responsibility for welfare reform from the state, and I have included $1.6M in my budget request to enable their request."
PUBLIC SAFETY Corrections The State Penitentiary in Rawlins was built to hold 561 inmates.
Modular units expanded the capacity to 781.
"Twelve months ago, we were housing 968 inmates in the Rawlins facility."
We contracted with a county facility in Texas to take 100 inmates from Rawlins.
"Now, we still have 100 inmates in Texas and about 968 inmates in Rawlins."
The net population growth has been averaging 9 to 10 per month.
"We must have more space, with proper classification, control, and professional staffing."
The proponents of the policies that would commute sentences or blindly set aside jury trials and convictions are high on something besides common sense.
"I would remind those who advocate leniency in our corrections policy, that the ""catch and release"" programs in Wyoming are under the Game and Fish Department, not the Corrections Department!"
"The major increase in this budget request, after K-12 education, is support for the various institutions and programs in the Department of Corrections."
"The primary increases are first and most importantly, for security, both for the public and for the safety of our corrections personnel."
Inmate programs and treatment are second priority.
Inmate housing in alternative secure placements will consume over $10 million of the additional funding just to accommodate the expected increases in adult male population ahead of completion of the new facility in Rawlins.
I recommend that we continue to purchase inmate housing both in and out of state through contractual arrangements.
The cost has grown from $35 million to construct a new facility to over $45 million in the past three years.
"In the meantime, we will necessarily continue to contract with prisons in other states to house our overflow at a cost of over $3 million per year."
"I am not following a politically convenient ""get tough"" attitude with criminals."
The clients that we have in our corrections programs are younger and more violent than ever before.
Over two thirds of all inmates in Rawlins have been convicted of violent crimes or sexual offenses.
They made their own choice to be where they are.
"Over the past 15 years, the average population in Rawlins has doubled."
even though Wyoming population has stayed relatively the same.
"But at the same time, convicted felons who are placed in less restrictive community settings and on parole have tripled, from nearly 1200 in 1981 to over 3500 in 1997."
We've already placed all the potential lower risk prisoners in community settings where they can be closer to support and earning part of their upkeep.
Let's not risk the lives and safety of our communities by making prisoner desires a higher priority than public safety.
Our first priority in prison management is to protect the health and safety of the public and the corrections staff.
Our second priority is inmate rehabilitation.
Programs and rehabilitation are indeed necessary considering that the average length of stay in the adult male corrections is 31 months.
Most inmates will be returning to society.
We don't want them to blow their freedom and end up back in prison.
The situation in Rawlins is considerably improved even with the issues of over crowding.
We have better staff training and procedures in place.
We have increased support for the staff.
We have decreased the influence of the con-bosses.
The problems that seem to crop up every day in the news are not new.
"In fact, there is an actual decrease from recent years."
It's just that we've chosen to publicize more of what's going on to draw attention to the need for better facilities and support.
"The best way to solve a problem is to elevate attention to it, not sweep it under the rug."
"Prison Finance Last year, you asked the State Building Commission to evaluate three options for prison financing: use of a cash appropriation, capital facilities revenue bonds or lease revenue bonds."
"At the time I submitted my budget recommendations last December, the Commission had not finished its work."
The SBC has since recommended that you pursue the establishment of a State Building Authority to issue lease revenue bonds for the financing of the new prison.
I concur with their recommendation and support the legislation that would establish the State Building Authority.
"With early passage of the legislation, the $41.7 million would be available as you requested last year."
"Victims' Rights Before I leave the issue of Corrections, I want to draw your attention to a small but significant bill regarding Victims' Rights."
"Last year you authorized the consolidation of two programs, one dealing with prevention of domestic violence and the other regarding victims' assistance programs."
The consolidation you approved is complete and ready for your approval.
It will allow more victims of crime and domestic violence to receive better service with quicker response and greater community support.
"As I watch the extraordinary fuss over the killer Keith Jesperson, I often wonder how much better off we would be if the media would focus even one-tenth as much attention on the victims of crime and their needs as they do the criminals."
Let's quit making celebrities out of criminals and be more attentive to the victims of their crimes!
All of society would be better off!
"INVESTING IN PEOPLE State Employee Pay Last month on a stopover in Casper, I was visiting with a lady at Eastridge Mall about several state issues."
She mentioned state employee pay and asked why I had not proposed any adjustment in compensation.
I answered by saying that my budget request did indeed include funding for pay in critical areas.
"She argued with me saying with considerable confidence that I had only proposed new pay for ""the executives."
"So I explained that the recent article in the newspaper was somewhat misleading, that the executive pay referred to was for all state employees, who make up the Executive Branch of state government, which also includes the community colleges and the University of Wyoming."
"All three entities should, indeed, be treated the same."
The lady thought the Executive Branch was only the executives in government.
Our state employees are skilled and experienced.
Two-thirds of them live outside the Cheyenne area in your home towns.
Many are being drawn away to other employment.
The best way to provide quality government services is to attract good quality people who are motivated and then properly compensated for the value of their work.
I followed the goal set by the Legislature four years ago to keep employee pay at 90 percent of the appropriate market for a given classification.
"The method requires the review of an independent compensation commission consisting of five members, three of whom are appointed by the Legislature and two appointed by the Governor."
The Compensation Commission was the source of my recommendations in the budget to meet the goal you set for pay.
I continue to support the goal as well as the new pay plan that gives much more recognition to the abilities of front line employees and managers as they assume more responsibility for the quality and efficiency of their work.
"Youth Last year, you approved a package of bills that refocuses juvenile treatment at the local level."
"I support prevention and intervention at the level where it will be most effective - in or near the home community, with a focus on Restorative Justice."
"Restorative Justice would make the victim and the community whole, in the case of youthful offenders, and would make the youth who are at risk of neglect and abuse more whole at the hand of the community that can best care for them."
I believe strongly in the value of community based treatment.
"Our juvenile proposals would keep juveniles in their communities, and bring the community into a stronger role of treatment for young people."
"The most disturbing trend in Wyoming youth today is the increasing use of drugs, particularly methamphetamine and to a lesser degree, heroin."
"Marijuana and alcohol continue to be high use drugs, but the use of methamphetamine, or crank as it's commonly known, is up dramatically."
"I strongly support a new initiative to deal with the alarming increase in the use of methamphetamine, particularly by young people."
"While enforcement and arrests can deter and diminish supply, we also have to reduce demand, to use education and substance abuse treatment programs to decrease the demand for the drug."
No town in Wyoming is exempt from this new epidemic.
"Small or large, the use is a creeping cancer, taking a toll on our youth and their future."
"Nationally, experimentation with methamphetamine by school age youth is four percent."
"The experimentation in one of Wyoming's largest counties is as high as 16 percent, or four times the national average!"
"The problem won't be solved just by putting more money into law enforcement, treatment, prevention, and education programs, even though that will help."
The most effective solution will be public concern and your personal involvement.
We must each be involved in our own communities or else lose our most treasured resource - our youth.
Welfare Reform Wyoming has gained national recognition for our progress in welfare reform.
"Over the past three years, total caseload has dropped by 66 percent, by far the best percentage of all 50 states."
The national average is only a reduction of 25 percent.
The new child support collection system is held up as a model for other states and our collections are twice what they were two years ago.
Wyoming's program to count higher education as qualifying work won recognition as the first of its kind to gain federal approval.
"With all the apparent success, though, we must continue to track former clients to see if we have permanent change or only temporary good statistics."
Our Department of Family Services has implemented a tracking system to determine where the clients are going and the prospects of permanent independence from public assistance.
The budget that I submitted has a substantial increase proposed for child care for low income families.
"With the success we have had in decreasing payments for welfare, we have an increasing need to assure effective and quality child care to families who are just now making the transition from public assistance to independent employment."
"Children's Health I have long been a strong advocate for preventive measures to enhance health care in Wyoming, particularly for children."
"Last summer, Congress passed a new Title 21 of the Social Security Act designed to give states the opportunity to provide health insurance coverage to low income, uninsured children."
"Since last fall, we have been working with your Joint Interim Labor, Health, and Social Services Committee to see if we can properly use the plan in Wyoming.We call it ""KidCare."
I support the Committee's work that could provide health care coverage for low income children that might not otherwise be insured.
There are problems yet to be worked out that must be resolved so that families don't just move from private pay providers onto a state funded system.
Our objective must be to bring health care coverage to children who have no other alternative.
"Properly implemented, it can be a conservative expansion of health insurance coverage for low income children."
"The bill supports employer-based health insurance, and gives us the flexibility that we need to use our funds efficiently."
I will follow the bill with interest and ask your favorable consideration.
"Early Childhood Council Last fall, I issued an executive order to establish an Early Childhood Development Council."
"This will bring state agencies together, and will bring in community advocates and parents as well."
Recent research has shown that from birth to age three are the most important years in a child's development.
I am not advocating the addition of new state services for children birth to age three.
Our focus is to do more for families and their children by refocusing current programs in a more supportive and effective way.
The current discussion over child care licensing would be a logical activity for the council to take on and recommend the type and level of inspections that would be most beneficial and efficient for the state.
Mental Health I support the proposals of your Select Committee and the Partnership for the Resolution of Mental Health Issues.
These efforts have continued the overall improvement of community based mental health services in Wyoming while avoiding more costly litigation.
"The initial progress you authorized last year has been good, particularly for children and adolescents who are seriously emotionally disturbed and adults who have serious, persistent mental illness."
The Wyoming State Hospital has been directed to continue its efforts toward facility improvement and national accreditation.
Their work also includes expanded services to local communities.
"I ask that you consider either the State Building Commission budget request to build a new facility in Evanston, or grant authority for the Department of Health to seek alternatives to improved facilities and services."
"If we slow our efforts now, we could lose the cooperation that has taken two years to build as we work to avoid further court actions."
PAYING THE BILLS How do we pay for everything?
Part of the answer comes from better planning and setting priorities.
"Strategic Planning Long overdue in government, strategic planning has increased the confidence of agency directors and allowed us to begin a rational process for setting priorities."
Requests for increased funding will not be approved unless all other programs have been reviewed for reductions.
All major agencies came to the table with their priorities and resources.
We took a comprehensive approach to budgeting and recognized the interdependency of programs.
"Sub-cabinet working groups have been established for : Human services Economic Development Natural resources Public Safety Separate operating agencies Each agency not only reviewed their own budgets, but also did a peer review of other agencies to evaluate impact and relative priorities."
"This past September, agency requests for expenditures exceeded the known revenues and fund balances by over $161.9 million."
The need to trim was obvious to bring about a balanced budget.
"In addition, that amount would have been an increase of 15 percent in spending, while my goal was to hold total spending constant."
"I challenged all agency directors to go back and review all priorities to determine those that were mandated by law and which were needed for health and safety reasons, and then rank their remaining requests in order of importance."
Then agencies sat down with groups of related agencies to review each others' budgets and priorities to reduce requests even further.
"The State Department of Education then updated their estimate of school foundation requirements, considering increased local revenues, increased estimates for state revenues and an unexpected decline in K-12 enrollments."
The overall effect of these three factors improved the K-12 profile by approximately $39 million.
"With an increase of $27 million in revenues and a decrease in the state share of K-12 expenses by $39 million, the $161.9 million deficit decreased to roughly $96.1 million."
"While that was welcome news, it still wasn't enough."
The Executive Branch then went through a more intensive review of agency priorities and looked to other earmarked accounts as a means of reducing the requests and reallocating existing resources.
The net effect was another $73 million reduction in General Fund requests.
"The budget you have provides for increases of $102 million new money for public schools and an increase of $17 million for Corrections and public safety, for a total increase in just these two categories of nearly $120 million, while the net increase in General Fund expenditures is only $30 million, or around three tenths of one percent."
"Instead of a 15 percent increase in state spending, you have a budget that is essentially flat compared to current obligations."
That was accomplished by reducing other agency spending to avoid overall increases.
"The ""flex"" has been the most important tool available to assure effective, efficient use of taxpayer dollars. ."
I strongly urge you to keep the flex provisions in the budget administration.
To do otherwise would decrease efficiency of service and sharply increase overall costs.
The Consensus Revenue Estimating Group The CREG revenue estimate revision came out just one month ago.
I had been somewhat apprehensive about the numbers since this has been a relatively mild winter compared to last year and I expected a decline in oil and gas revenue.
"But the estimate made last October had already allowed enough for the mineral decline, and with increased income in sales tax revenues, we have over $9.0 million more available than when I submitted my budget in December."
Severance taxes and federal mineral royalties were strong in 1997 primarily due to higher than expected natural gas prices in 1996.
"Reserve accounts are slightly higher than expected, primarily due to the Legislative Royalty Impact Assistance Account, which takes the bulk of royalties in excess of $200 million and income from coal bonus payments from recent federal sales."
The state's assessed valuation has risen from a low in 1988 of $5.7 billion to over $7 billion this year.
"For the first time since 1977, property other than minerals now exceeds the valuation of minerals in Wyoming."
Minerals had dominated our valuation and amounted to 72 percent of the total back in 1984.
"Residential, commercial and industrial properties have increased in value significantly in recent years."
Mineral valuation bottomed out in 1995 and has made a modest rebound in the past two years.
"For the next two years, I do not anticipate any significant changes to the current level of general fund revenues."
"Sales taxes remain strong, gas shows modest strength, oil continues a mild decline, as do coal and trona."
There are some very large coal lease sales planned over the next few years.
Investment income New management authority that was authorized by the Legislature to address investment strategy is in the final stages of implementation.
The State Land and Investment Board has approved asset allocations and fund strategies.
The recently approved constitutional amendment to allow investment in common stocks is in the process of implementation.
"However, the hoped for gains in interest income will still be several years away."
The amendment allows up to 25 percent of state permanent funds to be invested in equities.
"The permanent funds, counting Permanent Land Fund, the Permanent Wyoming Mineral Trust Fund, and the Workers Comp Account (which is authorized to be invested as if it were permanent funds) total over $2.4 billion."
That would allow $600 million to be invested in equities.
"As of today, we only have about $100 million invested in equities."
"Legislatively Directed Investments, which are often below market rates in order to accomplish some public policy purpose, restrict the amount that could otherwise be invested."
"Your State Loan and Investment Board recommends that you adopt the ""prudent investor rule"" to allow conservative investment that can improve yield returns and reduce the need for future tax increases."
"Wyoming's Fiscal Picture Since Fiscal Year 1987, the deficit of recurring revenues over expenditures in Wyoming has averaged $70 million per year."
"The shortage has typically been made up by transferring funds from reserves and by using special revenues, windfalls and one-time monies."
One ominous trend has been for all levels of government to postpone or eliminate basic maintenance and reconstruction.
"That makes the current year look good, but irresponsibly leaves us with long term asset deterioration and future deficits."
"Given the trend of the past, what does the future hold?"
"If we could focus on the changes that have been instituted for better management and planning, the future would be basically optimistic."
"But when we consider the uncertainty of school capital construction, highway maintenance, and deferred maintenance, each of them may need significant outlays in infrastructure expenditures that are not in the state's forecast."
Wyoming's basic revenue system is under review to make it more reliable to meet state needs.
Thanks to your support last year we have the Tax Reform 2000 Commission that has begun its 18 month task of developing recommendations for future revenues.
"The Tax Reform 2000 Commission is to recommend standards and options for developing a fair, viable, and economically competitive state and local tax structure capable of generating sufficient revenues to meet expected needs in the future."
The commission has approximately 18 months to complete its task.
"They could take the entire 18 months just for review and analysis, with added time needed to win public confidence in the final recommendations.Taxes What about taxes?Do we need any new revenue?"
"After the local optional six mills go away this year, most property owners will see a decrease in their property taxes."
Any increase in taxes should come only where it is an investment in equity.
"We must target any overall increases in state spending in those areas such as highways, schools, and job growth."
We don't need more spending on the operations of state government.
The strategic planning process has helped us hold the line on growth in government by moving funds from lower priorities to higher ones.
What we need to focus on is building capacity and increasing equity.
"Education, the economy, and quality of life all can be enhanced with targeted investments in equity, or those things that enhance future job growth and opportunity."
But let's put them all in perspective.
"I've been lobbied hard to support the five cent per gallon increase for gasoline and fuel to go to our highways, roads and bridges."
And I do support it as a user fee.
But many of the proponents of that increase have lobbied hard against new funding for our schools.That's a mistake.
The highest priority for new spending will be our schools.
"When we have that issue settled, we can turn our attention to the high priority of our transportation infrastructure."
"I will support the fuel tax, but will watch carefully to see how the schools, including higher education, fare first."
Telecommunications Key to economic diversity and growth as well as educational opportunity is a competitive telecommunications industry.
"The legislation that you adopted in 1995 soon became a model for much of the rest of America, and we are beginning to see strong results."
"We now have digital switching in all service areas, with the completion of the U S West upgrade and the installations by the independent providers."
Your legislative direction last year for development and implementation of a statewide education technology plan has had great results.
U S West is the successful bidder for a high-speed digital network which will offer access for all Wyoming schools to information and distance learning ahead of the target date of 2001.
But the benefits go far beyond the educational advantages.
Prospective providers were asked to bid a network that would serve our educational needs as an anchor tenant in a larger system.
"The result is an advanced use of technology that addresses the needs of the schools and leaves enough extra capacity to include other needed services such as telemedicine, connecting our libraries, with plenty of bandwidth left over for local business access and economic development."
The benefit to local business could easily become the single most significant factor to come from the school technology grant.
"With this advance for our schools, for health care, for our economy and certainly for our people, you can see the tremendous benefit that comes from good planning and a recognition that good government recognizes the interdependence of our services."
"The advances could not exist without the initiative and investment that has come from the private providers, including not only U S West, but also the independents."
Tri-County Telephone and TCT West combined forces to offer a state of the art SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork) capable of supporting the most advanced functions and features anywhere.
"The new connections function with only one switch, located in Basin, with fiber optic links to each Tri-County and TCT exchange."
Innovation is alive and well all over Wyoming!
"Electric Power While much of public attention has focused on deregulation and restructuring of traditional power industries, the Foote Creek Rim wind power plant in Carbon County has gotten well under way and will likely be producing electric energy later this year, adding value to one of Wyoming's most under-utilized resources: the WIND!"
Foote Creek marks Wyoming as a leader in implementing leading edge electric technology.
The first phase of the Two Elk power plant will be a 50 megawatt gas-fired combustion turbine located in Campbell county southeast of Wright.
The plant may begin delivering electricity as early as next fall.
An interconnection with a nearby natural gas pipeline will provide the gas to fire the turbine.
One of the lessons from this venture is that newer electric generation technologies can be deployed in far less time than even just a few years ago.
"Later stages of Two Elks may increase the generation output to 250 megawatts, using not only gas, but also waste coal, making better use of a dwindling resource."
"These examples of changes in the way electricity is generated signals changes in the industry as a whole, not only for generation but also for transmission and distribution."
"Given that the competition is opening up nationally, we still want to approach restructuring the Wyoming way."
Much time and effort has been expended over the last two years identifying the challenges that restructuring would have for Wyoming.
Your legislative committee has worked hard to bring an informed approach and I commend their efforts.
Many of Wyoming's gas customers have a choice on gas supply thanks to a pioneering program that was first used here in Wyoming.
"The ""choice gas"" program saved money for 95 percent of the retail customers living in the K-N service area."
"Just when you might think that there is no real pioneering to be done, Lower Valley Power and Light has given us a new way."
They have successfully brought natural gas utility service to the Jackson and Afton areas and given residents a chance to lower their winter heating bills.
"Federal Resource Issues Wyoming continues to be plagued with a hodgepodge of federal actions and jurisdictions that are often in conflict with each other or, at best, confusing in action."
The Greater Yellowstone Area is but one example.
"We have worked on transportation issues, bison migration, wolves, grizzlies, brucellosis, snowmobiling, and winter use."
"Only after we spent extraordinary effort here and with our congressional delegation, were we able to obtain cooperating agency status for the states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana along with designated gateway communities including Jackson and Cody."
"Cooperating status means that the state and local groups will be recognized in management issues to give the people most affected by management decisions, a voice in the outcome."
I spend over half my time working out problems caused by federal management indecisiveness.
"We have worked to settle litigation on the Platte River through a cooperative agreement, following a pattern set on the Colorado River."
"For three years now, I've invited all federal agencies in Wyoming to come to the Governor's Kitchen Table Conference to discuss issues of mutual concern, from air service to park management to mineral development."
"Our intent is to work for solutions, not confrontation."
The Southwest Wyoming Technical Air Forum was but one example that resulted from these conferences.
We have worked hard through the Western Governors' Association to resolve even greater issues of management.
We have had personal meetings with the President's Council on Environmental Quality to resolve how the National Environmental Policy Act can be streamlined and include community involvement.
We have sponsored the Open Lands Conference to give landowners and communities better tools to guide development and preserve quality of life.
We have taken the lead on resolving the difficulties in the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act to give the states and landowners greater certainty in species recovery and funding.
Water quality and air quality issues take actions that go beyond our state boundaries.
"In every case, Wyoming has worked for cooperative solutions, but at the same time have pushed the agencies to recognize that the states are not employees of the federal government."
"Indeed, we have concurrent and shared responsibilities."
"Judicial Reorganization As soon as I complete my remarks, Chief Justice Taylor will be giving his State of the Judiciary address."
I endorse the proposals of the Supreme Court to evaluate and reorganize the court system in our state.
"The budget this session contains funding for yet another county court system that still isn't well defined in terms of organization, work load and funding."
"Rather than letting the system plod on into inefficient oblivion, I encourage you to give favorable consideration to the Justices' proposal for a reorganization commission."
Conclusion We have many positive changes that show the results of our mutual work together.
Education opportunities for our children are better than ever.Let's build on that momentum.
We most certainly have had instances of frustration where the progress of reform has not been as quick or as expansive as we might have wanted.
But that is the nature of democracy.
"We can look at our mutual record of achievement and at the work to be done, with renewed enthusiasm to continue our diligent, and certainly patient, work to shape and remodel the legacy we received from those who went before us."
Last week I had the opportunity to review a report called The Wyoming Business Barometer.
"Schlesinger Associates, a Wyoming company, has taken a private initiative to survey our Wyoming businesses to find out what's really happening in our state."
"They asked some tough questions, such as what are the main growth deterrents to economic growth statewide."
The answers were very revealing.
One of the major factors listed as a deterrent was the non-growth attitude business perceives is coming from state and local government.
Also cited as a factor was the lack of governmental technical assistance for business growth.
Most revealing was the fact that 75% of the businesses surveyed did not know there are state programs for businesses assistance.That indicates two things.
Assistance needs to be delivered at the local level and the support needs to be marketed so that business can take advantage of what's there.
But even more significant in the Schlesinger report were the survey data that show Wyoming's businesses are very optimistic about the economy.
Over 75 percent of all businesses in Wyoming say that current sales are as good as or better than last year.
"85 percent say that they have customer base as good as or better than last year, and 77 percent say that profitability is as good or better than last year."
But even better statistics are forecast for the next year.
Eighty-eight percent of our businesses believe that their business direction will be the same or better than this year.
Fifty percent plan new equipment and business upgrades.
Forty-two percent plan new employee training.
Thirty-seven percent plan to add new product or production lines.
"Far more businesses look to their local Chambers of Commerce and economic development organizations than they do to the state for assistance, bearing out the findings that any state development structure must focus at the local or regional level."
That's a remarkable show of optimism that is certainly not reflected in state wide media and reports.
We have a strong and enthusiastic base of operations for economic growth.The time is ripe.
We shouldn't waste another minute.Let's get to work!
