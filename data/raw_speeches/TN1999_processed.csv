SENTENCES
Governor Wilder.Speaker Naifeh.
Members of the 101st General Assembly.Constitutional Officers.Justices of the Supreme Court.Attorney General Summers.Members of the Cabinet.My fellow Tennesseans.
"I come before you this evening to fulfill my constitutional obligation to ""give to the General Assembly information of the state of the government."
"The framers of our state’s constitution followed the example of our nation’s founding fathers; they crafted a government built on a system of checks and balances among the executive, legislative and judicial branches."
I am mindful that the voters who returned our administration to office also returned the vast majority of senators and representatives who sought another term.
They did so because they are satisfied with the way we have jointly guided our state’s policies and progress.
And they did so in the hope and expectation that we will continue to work together to meet the great challenges of Tennessee’s third century.
"In my inaugural address I quoted Thomas Jefferson: "" every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle."
We hold more in common as Tennesseans than we hold differently as partisans.
"We are, as Jefferson said, ""brethren of the same principle."
"For our citizens and for our state’s future, it is important that we work together to do what’s right for Tennessee."
We can have no finer example to follow than that of a man who made it his life’s work to do what’s right for Tennessee – our recently retired Comptroller William Snodgrass.
For 44 years Mr. Snodgrass was Tennessee’s fiscal watchdog.
It is not by accident that Tennessee is one of the handful of states to have earned AAA bond ratings from all the major rating agencies.
He did excellent work alongside governors of both parties.
He is the very model of principled public service.
"On behalf of all Tennesseans I say, thank you, Mr. Snodgrass."
"In many important respects, the State of our State has never been better: Our policies have encouraged an unprecedented season of economic growth for our state -- four consecutive record years for business investment and job creation."
Over the first 8 years of this decade Tennessee ranks 4th in the nation in personal income growth.
"In the last four years we have increased state funding for our public schools from 1.88 billion dollars to more than 2.4 billion, and we have begun an important debate about how to improve our colleges, universities and technical schools."
The crime packages we have crafted together have helped to reduce crime and to make our neighborhoods safer.
Our TNKids initiative has focused the state’s attention on the well-being of our children as never before.
The welfare reforms we enacted together have resulted in a 60 percent drop in the number of employable adults on welfare.
Our environment is the cleanest it’s been in a generation.
It is precisely because our state is experiencing good times that we have the opportunity to plan ahead.
"So, tonight I will dwell not so much on the State of our State but rather on what we must do to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"Our Poet Laureate, Margaret Britton Vaughn, opens her Bicentennial poem with the reminder that: ""The fertile soil of Tennessee grew more than corn, tobacco and cotton."
"It grew a crop of people who are Trailblazers…"" Tonight, I urge the members of the historic 101st General Assembly to join me in claiming that distinction for ourselves."
"Seventy-six years ago, Governor Austin Peay and the 73rd General Assembly faced up to a similar challenge."
They met it by enacting reforms that influenced our state’s course for decades to follow.
They made it possible: to improve public education; to build hundreds of miles of modern highways; to provide state funds for the first time to the University of Tennessee and other institutions of higher learning; to create our system of state parks and to clear the way for creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
"These are important and lasting achievements, and they are the reason we remember Governor Peay and his contemporaries today."
And they were made possible by the first important reforms Austin Peay undertook – the reorganization of government and the reform of the tax code.
"Tonight, I intend to discuss these same issues – government reorganization, tax reduction and fairness – and one other that’s become a concern in our day, the stability of TennCare."
I use Austin Peay as a point of reference because in many ways his administration ushered Tennessee into the 20th century.
"But his reforms came 23 years after the century dawned, following years of drift and indecision, and so they were undertaken in response to a crisis."
"Tennessee today is not in crisis, but one looms on the not too-distant horizon and knowing this, we have an obligation to act now to forestall it."
"Interestingly, our situation today is strikingly similar to that of Governor Peay’s day."
"The economy has changed, and the way Tennesseans live and work has changed, but our government and tax structure have not."
"In the 1920’s, state government still relied on property tax revenue, just as it had in the 1800’s."
Property taxes met the state’s needs back when most Tennesseans farmed and when agriculture was the largest sector of our economy.
But by the 1920’s most Tennesseans were not farmers.
The dominant forces in the state’s economy were business and industry.
"As Governor Peay explained it: ""Our taxing system was devised in the beginning for an agricultural state, and although government has expanded in all directions, and its demands have enormously increased, it has continued to lay the increasing burden on land."
"It has not shifted the proper share of cost to the income producing property, which has come into existence with modern business."
"The result was the steady erosion of the state’s tax base to the point that -- even in a time of plenty -- state government operated in the red, unable to fund vital services."
"Most economic activity occurred beyond the reach of the state’s property tax, and those whom the tax did reach bore an unfair and heavy burden."
Governor Peay and his contemporaries responded with sweeping tax reform.
"They abolished the state property tax and replaced it with Franchise & Excise taxes, which imposed a lower tax rate but spread the tax burden fairly and broadly."
"For the 76 years since, Franchise & Excise taxes have been Tennessee’s principal business taxes."
F&E taxes apply to corporations.
"In the 1920’s, that’s how the vast majority of businesses organized themselves."
"Today, however, businesses have other options; they can organize as Limited Liability Companies or LLCs; as limited partnerships; as sole proprietorships – all entitites which operate outside the boundaries of our F&E taxes."
"What’s more, the passage of time and changing business practices have revealed the F&E tax to be full of loopholes."
For example: One business in this state reorganized itself in 1997 and cut its state taxes from about 195 thousand dollars to just 10 – not ten thousand -- ten dollars!Click here for graph.
"In another instance, a national chain with outlets in Tennessee reorganized and lowered its state taxes from nearly one million dollars to 7 thousand dollars.Click here for graph."
Many businesses are able to essentially zero-out their tax liability with the stroke of a pen – and increasing numbers of them are doing just that.
"As a result, at a time when our economy is strong – in fact, in the midst of the best economic year we’ve ever had -- F&E tax collections this fiscal year are running 8 percent below actual collections from the previous year.And it will get worse."
Our F&E tax is projected to erode by more than 100 million dollars annually for years to come.Click here for graph.It’s 1923 all over again.
"A vast and growing amount of economic activity is taking place beyond the reach of our state’s principal business taxes, and those who do pay the tax, pay one of the higher tax rates in the Southeast."
"This is the situation I propose to remedy – not by raising business tax rates – but by cutting them, and applying them fairly and broadly as part of a package of tax reduction, simplification, and reform: the Tax Relief and Fairness Act of 1999."
"I call on this General Assembly : To repeal the sales tax on grocery food; To repeal the franchise and excise taxes and To replace them with a single, simplified and lower business tax rate, applied fairly to all businesses in Tennessee, regardless of how they are organized."
Let me take them one at a time.
Repealing the sales tax on grocery food will mean tax relief for every single Tennessee household.
"For an average family of four, it means annual savings of almost $500."
It will also help grocers in the many Tennessee communities that are within an easy drive of competitors across state lines.
"Because our repeal of sales taxes on grocery food will also affect the local-option sales taxes collected on those items, I recommend that the state replace the revenues local government will lose."
"Eliminating the sales tax on food is a goal many of us have shared, but have been unable to fund."
"It is achievable now, as part of the Tax Relief and Fairness Act."
The Tax Relief and Fairness Act also repeals the F&E taxes and replaces them with what we call the fair business tax.
It represents tax savings for many and tax fairness for all.
It is also simple; the return fits on the front of single sheet of paper.
It involves a straight-forward calculation: 2 ½ percent of a company’s compensation and 2 ½ percent of the profit it reports for federal tax purposes.
We will exempt the first 50 thousand dollars in each category.
"With those exemptions, more than 100 thousand small businesses – sole proprietorships, family farms – will owe no tax and won’t even have to file a return."
"The fair business tax treats all businesses alike, regardless of how they choose to organize themselves."
"And because the fair business tax applies to all businesses, we can afford to sharply reduce the business tax rate."
"At 2 ½ percent, it will be one of the lowest business tax rates in America."
"For companies looking for a fair deal, our state will be even more attractive as a business location."
But those looking for tax loopholes should look elsewhere.
You will hear the outcry of those who have had a free ride and now object to paying their fair share.
You will hear from those who say we ought to preserve special breaks for some businesses and impose an income tax on working Tennesseans.
That’s not tax relief; it’s not tax reform; it’s not tax simplification; and it’s not tax fairness.
All an income tax does is raise the tax burden on Tennesseans and create a way to finance the easy and endless expansion of government.
Tennessee does not need a state income tax.
"I know you will be heavily lobbied – especially since our tax applies to lobbyists, too – but make sure the lobbyists aren’t the only ones you listen to."
Listen as well to the softer and more numerous voices of those who will pay less: the thousands of businesses for whom we provide fairness and lower rates; the millions of families for whom we provide sales tax relief.
What I propose are the most sweeping business tax changes Tennessee has undertaken in three-quarters of a century.
The Tax Relief and Fairness Act of 1999 accomplishes what Austin Peay’s reforms did in the 1920’s – they adapt our business tax structure to the way business is done today: We treat every business the same.We close loopholes.
"By making the business tax simple, we make it harder for people to game the system, and by cutting the tax rate, we vastly reduce their incentive to try."
"In addition, we make possible the biggest sales tax reduction in our state’s history – $549 million in tax relief."
"That represents hundreds of dollars in tax relief for every family, especially to those struggling to make ends meet."
"And, we assure our state of a broad, equitable and elastic tax base that will adequately support vital services for our citizens – now and well into the future."
"That must figure into your deliberations, as well."
"We’ve set ambitious priorities: Offering our children a safe, healthy start and An excellent education Creating economic opportunity Protecting public safety and health, and our environment In the near future, we want to turn our attention to improving higher education and providing an expanded range of home care services for older Tennesseans."
The Tax Relief and Fairness Act will give our state the solid financial foundation we need to address those objectives.
"Revenue, however, is only one side of the coin; the other is making sure we do government’s work better and become more selective about what government’s work is."
The last time our state reorganized its cabinet-level departments was 1959.
A great deal has changed in the 40 years since.
"Today, it is increasingly important that we are able to work together across departmental lines."
"Welfare reform, for instance, draws on the resources of seven departments."
Our TNKids initiative coordinates the efforts of five departments.
"Later this spring, I intend to create cabinet working groups to better coordinate related services among departments."
"I have asked the Commissioner of Finance & Administration, John Ferguson, to direct this project."
Members of my cabinet will lead some of these working groups.
"In other instances, I will be adding respected executives to my staff to lead these groups I do not believe we need to radically alter the structure of state government."
"I do believe we can more sensibly group related functions, and I believe there are many areas where inter-departmental cooperation can mean better service for our citizens."
We will pursue those changes carefully and in consultation with you.
"I approach this as one approaches the renovation of a fine old home; the foundation and structure are strong, but we need to rewire and remodel for the way we live and work today."
"I do ask your support for one specific reorganization proposal, having to do with workforce development."
"Like the Tax Relief and Fairness Act, our workforce development program changes the way we do business in order to keep pace with changes in the economy."
The economy of the Technological Age will require workers to continue to acquire and upgrade skills throughout their working lifetime.
The current job training system just isn’t up to the job.
"It is complicated, cumbersome and inefficient."
"In too many instances, the current system is not training people for the jobs employers are creating."
"In its place, I urge you to consolidate job training and placement programs currently scattered among the departments of Labor, Employment Security, Education, Economic & Community Development, and Human Services."
This is partly a matter of necessity – we need to conform to federal changes in job training programs.
But this is also a matter of genuine importance to Tennessee employers and workers.
"In fact, few workplace issues have united our state’s employers and workers the way our workforce development plan has."
"Our plan has the enthusiastic support of business groups, organized labor, and many community organizations involved in job training partnerships."
The legislation we offer – sponsored by Senators Jerry Cooper and Ben Atchley and Representatives Matt Kisber and Steve McDaniel -- enjoys bipartisan support.
"It reflects the consensus here in Tennessee that we need to do a better job training and retraining our citizens for good jobs, and helping to match them up with employers who need willing workers with today’s skills."
"Our workforce development reforms represent an investment in our citizens, a way to help them compete for and win good jobs."
It will also be a catalyst for economic expansion and job creation by providing Tennessee business and industry with the skilled labor force they need to compete in the global economy.
I urge you to pass the workforce development bill and let us get to work putting Tennesseans to work.
There is one other very important reform we must take on this year – one that affects both our state’s financial stability and the well-being of 1.3 million of our fellow Tennesseans.
I am talking about the program that is rightly regarded as Governor Ned McWherter’s legacy -- TennCare.
"Five years ago, Governor McWherter enlisted your help in creating TennCare, saying: ""At stake is nothing less than the financial stability of state government and the access to health care for 1.5 million Tennesseans."
Our administration has worked with you through TennCare’s start-up problems and growing pains.
"In many ways, TennCare has been a success for our state and our citizens."
We have extending coverage to 400 thousand people who would not otherwise have health insurance.
We have made health care coverage universally available to children.
"Our child immunization rate has reached an all-time high, while rates of teen pregnancy and infant mortality have fallen to all-time lows."
The federal government has renewed our TennCare waiver and other states view our program as a model for their own.
And Tennessee has saved billions of dollars compared to what we would have spent on Medicaid.
"But in the fast-changing arena of health care, five years is a lifetime."
"TennCare was begun in a different era – before the rise in pharmaceutical costs, before federal Medicaid changes, before the changing circumstances of hospitals."
Those changes within the health care industry have affected TennCare.
"I am convinced that many of our operational shortcomings have their roots in deeper, systemic problems."
"Recently, we have added Brian Lapps as our new TennCare Director."
"His background makes him uniquely qualified to address the operation problems, and also to help us adapt TennCare to the changing structural issues affecting the health care industry landscape."
"We believe we understand many of the most significant problems, namely: TennCare provides a richer package of benefits that most Tennesseans can afford to buy for themselves."
"Our coverage for prescription drugs is especially generous, to the point that fully 22 percent of our TennCare dollars are spent on prescription drugs."
"That is far above the national Medicaid average, and it is unsustainable."
"Secondly, TennCare’s eligibility rules are too easily gamed."
"If you had an auto accident this afternoon, you wouldn’t expect to be able to buy auto insurance tonight and have your repairs covered tomorrow; but we allow people to opt-out of TennCare until they need it, collect the benefits, and then drop out again when the premiums are due."
And that’s not the only way we’re being gamed.
We have anecdotal evidence of high-income individuals and out-of-state residents utilizing TennCare as their safety net – a role never envisioned for this program.
"We are experiencing a significant increase in the number of TennCare clients who are considered ""uninsurable"".Click here for chart."
"Our eligibility criteria are so broad that an ""uninsurable"" person is basically anyone who says he or she is uninsurable."
"We have evidence to suggest that insurers and businesses are ""cherry picking"", structuring their health benefits in a way that encourages those with high-cost conditions to get on TennCare."
"Taken together, these factors are sharply increasing TennCare’s costs."
Our projections are that TennCare’s budget will require recurring increases of more than 142 million dollars annually.
"We are close to finding ourselves back where we were before TennCare, when the ruinously expensive Medicaid program threatened our state's solvency."
"Remember Governor McWherter’s warning in 1993: ""Our attempts to keep paying for the current health care system will eventually destroy the quality of every state service in Tennessee."
We could add a half cent to the sales tax each year forever and not keep pace with the cost of Medicaid.
"We must protect the health care system on which 1.3 million Tennesseans depend, and we must protect the financial stability of our state."
As a starting point: I propose that TennCare enrollment be closed to all adults except those who are Medicaid eligible.
This will stabilize program costs in the short term and give us time to work with you to address the larger issues.
I propose that we make TennCare’s package of benefits no more generous than what most Tennesseans can afford to buy for themselves.
"I propose to ask the federal government to amend our TennCare waiver, to permit changes in eligibility and premiums."
"We must be able to prevent people from ""gaming"" the system."
We must be able to require that those who can pay for their coverage do so.
I propose that we examine methods to address the adverse selection occurring in our program.
It is important that all public and private parties carry their financial share in assuring access to high quality health care for Tennesseans.
These reforms will stabilize TennCare and return it to its first principles.
"With costs stabilized, our goal will be to re-open enrollment and to keep it open."
But first we must address TennCare’s structural shortcomings.The time to do so is now.
"I have spoken tonight about difficult issues – tax relief and fairness, the reorganization of state government, the reform of TennCare."
But I believe every problem also presents opportunity.
The opportunity we have is a rare one.
"It is the same opportunity Austin Peay and 73rd General Assembly seized in 1923, when they refashioned our government and tax structure for the 20th century, and in so doing, ushered in one of the most remarkable seasons of progress our state has known."
"We can claim such a legacy for ourselves, if we too, will rise to challenge of our day."
"I have outlined a bold program to seize our opportunities, and to address our problems, not just for this year, but for many, many years to come."
"By establishing a tax structure that is broad, fair, elastic and built on low rates; by organizing government for the way people live and work in the 21st century; by assuring that our safety net programs provide good service at a cost our taxpayers can abide -- our program will make possible the season of promise that all of us desire for our state."
"It will give us the means to continue to improve our schools, and to begin to create one of the nation’s best systems of higher education."
"It will enable us to help our children get a safe, healthy start, to offer a health care safety net to all who need it, and to expand health care options for our older citizens."
"It will enable us to fight crime, punish criminals and keep our neighborhoods safe."
"It will enable us to protect the natural beauty all around us in Tennessee and to pass it on to our children, and to their children."
I ask you to act boldly today to ensure a brighter tomorrow for our citizens.
"Earlier this evening, I quoted Jefferson."
"Let me close by invoking one of my favorite presidents, the plain-spoken Harry Truman: ""Plowing a field with a mule is the most satisfying thing a man can do."
"And at the end of the day, looking over what you’ve done, you can feel a real sense of accomplishment, and that’s a very rare thing."
A rare opportunity presents itself.
It’s a big field that I propose we plow this year.
"But when we adjourn this historic 101st General Assembly, we, too, can look over what we’ve done with that rare sense of accomplishment at what we’ve done to prepare Tennessee for the future."
"Thank you, God bless you, and good night."
