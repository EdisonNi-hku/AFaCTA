sentences
Mr. Speaker, Gov. Siegelman, Senators and Representatives, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Alabama Supreme Court, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the executive branch of government, I welcome you here to begin the second regular session of our term.
You passed solid legislation in the last regular session that, when implemented, will improve the lives of countless Alabamians.
Education reform is your mandate to improve scores on basic achievement tests and eliminate mismanagement in our public school system.
The testing of new teachers for certification is already under attack by lawsuit.
Mismanagement is being exposed in too many schools.
The battle has just begun.
I expect aggressive leadership from Dr. Ed Richardson, our state Superintendent of Education, and Drs.
Jimmy Baker and Joe Morton, our Assistant State Superintendents.
I believe they are capable and determined.
I know we have thousands of fine teachers who, child by child, wage war on illiteracy daily.
As I noted years ago, they are the infantry and our Foundation Program will provide them with the resources to win.
Let me remind parents that without your support and participation, it is hard to educate your child.
That is your primary responsibility.
I pledge to you as Governor and Chairman of the State School Board, I will do all within my authority to carry out your mandate.
However, if my authority is insufficient, I will ask you to grant me the authority to get the job done.
We must succeed in our mission to rescue children who can, but who are not learning to read and write because of poor instruction and little or no discipline.
Due to legislation you passed last year, as of January 1, 1996, any circuit court judge who receives more than $2,000 in aggregate as a campaign contribution from an attorney, associates and partners, agents, clients, agents of clients, directly or indirectly, must recuse himself or herself from the case if requested to by the opposing attorney.
This is good law and when coupled with the approval of three court reform resolutions which will be on the ballot in the June primary, you have provided the framework for our court system to be more independent, more open, more disciplined, less political and less likely to ever forsake the Separation of Powers Doctrine.
And you did more.
You passed a strong industrial incentive package to make Alabama competitive without giving away the state.
You also passed a much improved ethics law.
Some say your work in the last regular session was the best in recent memory.
That is true and I thank you for it.
But today is a new day.
So let us look at the history of tort reform.
In 1987, the Alabama Legislature passed comprehensive tort reform legislation.
"Mr. James K. Coyne, President of the American Tort Reform Association said Alabama's package was one of the nation's best, and I quote: ""The Alabama Legislature passed one of the five best tort reform packages in the nation this year."
The generic changes adopted in Alabama will provide a tremendous economic advantage' to businesses operating in the state.
If I had a business in Mississippi, I'd think about moving it to Alabama.
But the Alabama Supreme Court struck down the 1987 Statute on Tort Reform.
In Armstrong v. Rogers Outdoor Sports (1991) the Court struck down a law empowering the trial courts to reduce punitive damage awards on the grounds that the separation of powers doctrine required reform only by constitutional amendment.
In Henderson v. Alabama Power Company (1993) the court struck down limits on punitive damages on the grounds that the civil jury trial guaranty of the constitution requires reform only by constitutional amendment.
You might note it was four years from the date of the 1987 statute to the first Alabama Supreme Court ruling.
Since then, lawsuits have flourished in Alabama.
Punitive damage awards have increased beyond reason.
"Several counties seem to attract numerous lawsuits where ""jackpot justice"" has the feel of a California gold rush."
On January 8, 1996, I called the Alabama Legislature into special session for one purpose, to pass tort reform.
I proposed a constitutional amendment that capped punitive damages for wanton acts, but not for willful acts.
I did my best to guarantee a legal wall of separation between willful and wanton.
But to no avail.
Then, on the tenth day of the 12-day special session, I took another route.
I converted Alabama's 1987 Tort Reform statute into a constitutional amendment and sent it to the Senate.
After hours of work, five words stood in the way of total agreement.
"Those words are, ""as a matter of law."
Many of you in this chamber strongly requested I call a special session on tort reform and you were right to do so.
And I did, and we need it just as badly now as we did a month ago, because without it our efforts to recruit industry are handicapped which is a direct threat to jobs for our people and this cannot stand.
Therefore, I ask you to make tort reform the number one issue in this regular session.
We have the experience of the special session to build on.
When the special session started, the gap of disagreement was volumes wide.
Now only five words separate us.
So it was a difficult session, as tort reform is a complex issue.
"But, an old English proverb says, ""A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor."
Down through the centuries our courts have always adhered to the principle that the judge determines the law and the jury determines the facts.
"If the five words which separate us, ""As a matter of law"" were inserted into my tort reform amendment the jury would lose its traditional constitutional authority to hear evidence and decide disputed issues of fact."
I am not alone in this opinion.
"Thomas Jefferson said, and I quote, ""The people are not qualified to judge questions of law, but they are very capable of judging questions of fact."
In the form of juries, therefore, they determine matters of fact, leaving to the permanent judges to decide the law resulting from those facts.
I deem one of the essential principles of our government, and consequently one which ought to shape its administration.
trial by juries impartially selected.
My proposed constitutional amendment limits punitive damage awards but adheres to the principles of law that have served us so well for so long.
I ask you to support my constitutional amendment and allow the people to vote on it in the June Primary.
I think an amendment is necessary to cap punitive damages.
Others believe it can be done statutorily.
I respectfully disagree with this position from a legal standpoint.
However, if one wishes to introduce a statute duplicating my amendment, so be it.
I think bills of venue, recusal, mediation, written instructions to the jury, jury selection, wrongful death, offers of demands for judgment and medical malpractice could pass quickly as total or near agreement was reached in the special session on the House and Senate version of these bills.
This is a good start.
The mini-code is an issue we must resolve retroactively as well as prospectively or risk the withdrawal of vital financial services from Alabama and gross injustices to thousands of consumers and numerous businesses.
The four remaining bills are self-critical analysis, rogue agent, products liability and arbitration, and I suggest you tackle them as you finish the others.
Tort reform is not the whole story.
There are other serious issues facing Alabama.
I propose a campaign finance bill that will eliminate the co-mingling of funds so the name of a campaign contributor and the final recipient of the contribution are connected and fully disclosed.
Public disclosure on a timely basis directly linking who gives and who receives is the backbone of any honest campaign finance reform.
The time has come to give the people of Alabama the right to put an issue on the ballot for a statewide referendum vote.
This bill will empower the people to enact general laws and constitutional amendments.
Laws and constitutional amendments passed in this way will not require the governor's signature, nor will they be subject to his veto.
In order to get a general law on the ballot, five percent of the voters in the most recent gubernatorial election must sign a petition.
A constitutional amendment will require the signatures of eight percent of the total votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election.
I urge you to pass a resolution for a constitutional amendment to give the people of Alabama the right of initiative and referendum.
They richly deserve it.
"The Alabama Commission on Higher Education has been called a ""toothless tiger"" because it lacks the legal authority to limit duplication in two and four year schools."
Our bills will put teeth in the tiger by providing measures to clarify and strengthen the authority of ACHE in regulating, planning, coordinating and setting standards for our institutions.
We will also stop subsidizing college tuition for out of state students.
A voter identification bill will end abuse of election laws by requiring voters to present identification when voting.
Why not guarantee honest elections?
Under the direction of a committee headed by Representative Jim Carns and including Senator Hank Sanders, Senator Dwight Adams, Senator George Clay, Representative Ed Maull, Representative Perry Hooper, Representative Locy Baker and Representative Thomas Jackson, we will offer legislation that will end the debilitative and destructive cycle of welfare dependency that discourages personal initiative and encourages indolence and apathy.
What we are offering in our welfare reform package is a lifeline to the truly needy and the hope of a self-reliant future to those entrapped by welfare.
A workers compensation anti-fraud unit bill will require all self-insured employers, group insurance funds, employees and designated agents to report people who are stealing from the public by making false workers' compensation claims.
The bill will create an investigative unit under the Department of Industrial Relations to investigate claims of fraud.
If probable cause exists that fraud has been committed, the matter will be referred to the Attorney General.
We will offer legislation which will help safeguard the welfare of those receiving abortions in our state: By requiring every hospital in the state to report to the Alabama Department of Public Health the number of patients admitted because of complications related to an abortion or attempted abortion.
By requiring mandatory professional liability insurance or approved self-insurance for all abortion centers, employees and physicians.
By requiring parents of a minor child seeking an abortion to sign a consent form in the presence of the abortion provider.
By ensuring that health care workers who refuse to participate in an abortion because of religious conviction or reason of conscience cannot be fired, disciplined, retaliated against, sued or criminally charged.
By ensuring that parents have access to medical information and records of their unmarried children under the age of 19.
And by requiring a 48-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed, except in medical emergencies.
Drug addiction continues to take its toll on our society in numerous ways.
We must cut this scourge off at the source.
I will propose legislation that will impose a mandatory 25-year jail sentence without parole for drug kingpins on the first offense.
A drug kingpin is defined in the bill as any person who engages in a criminal enterprise for the purpose of trafficking hardcore illegal drugs.
A kingpin is further defined as someone who is not operating on his own, but supervises at least five people in pushing drugs.
If a kingpin is caught a second time, he will be executed.
Serious crime, including murder, is soaring among young people and yet their identity cannot be publicly disclosed.
A bill we will offer will allow juvenile offenders to be identified and their criminal records opened to the public.
And so ends our proposed legislation at this time.
"To everything there is a season--""A time to heal"" and a ""time for peace."
I pray tonight that historians will record this 1996 Regular Session of the Legislature of the Great State of Alabama, as one of mutual trust and good will, that produced legislation for the welfare of all the people.
To this end, Mr. Speaker---Gov. Siegelman, let us commit ourselves.
It is time.
Thank you.
