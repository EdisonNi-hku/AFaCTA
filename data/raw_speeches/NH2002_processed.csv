SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, honorable members of the House, Senate and Executive Council, my fellow citizens of New Hampshire: I am honored to be here to report to you once again on the state of our great state of New Hampshire.This year is different."
On September 11th our nation was tested.
"Here in New Hampshire, we lost family, friends and neighbors."
"We mourned, with our nation, the loss of life."
In New Hampshire we did not yield to threats and fear.
I am proud that our state house was one of the few that did not shut down on September 11th.
We have celebrated a renewed American spirit.
"We have recommitted ourselves to the American values, the New Hampshire values, that our men and women in uniform have defended with their lives for generations: democracy and freedom, justice and opportunity."
"We have a renewed appreciation for the people whose courage and tireless service make such a difference in our lives and in our communities - police officers, firefighters, National Guard members, postal workers, and all those who safeguard our public health."
"Today, I ask you to please join me in recognizing six people who exemplify these every day heroes - our firefighter-lawmakers.Russ Bridle.Bill Clayton.Jeff Goley.Jim Holland.Steve L'Heureux.Eric Palangas."
"And let's not forget the Speaker's Chief of Staff, Manchester firefighter Terry Pfaff."
And all our volunteer firefighters.
We thank you all for your service and we are honored by your presence.
We face new challenges today: threats to our security that before September 11th were unimaginable on American soil.
I assure you we are meeting these new challenges.
New Hampshire's emergency response systems are strong.
"Immediately after September 11th, I took action to make our state more secure, stepping up patrols of our harbor and bridges, increasing inspections along our highways."
I answered President Bush's call to put National Guard troops at our airports.
"We are expanding the state's public health lab, offering biological hazard training for police officers, and taking other steps to enhance our emergency response systems.We must do more."
"In the weeks following September 11th, our police and fire departments, haz mat teams and state public health labs were strained to the limit responding to legitimate concerns about anthrax."
"But outrageously and unforgivably, some people committed hoaxes."
We will not accept that behavior in New Hampshire.
"Work with me, Representative Bob Clegg and Senator Hollingworth to toughen the punishment for anyone who makes phony threats or hoaxes."
We must protect the people who protect us - the men and women of the New Hampshire National Guard.
"When I called up the Guard to protect our airports, we found an unjust omission in state law: National Guardsmen and women who are called up for state duty do not get the same employment protections as when they are called up for national duty.This is wrong."
Work with me and Senators Jack Barnes and Lou D'Allesandro to correct this oversight.
"When the brave members of our National Guard leave their jobs to protect us here in New Hampshire, we should guarantee they will get those jobs back."
"It is not just new challenges to our national security that we face, it is also new challenges to our economic security; challenges you and I must meet together."
"Nowhere have these economic challenges been greater than in Berlin and Gorham, devastated by the closing of their pulp and paper mills."
"I have directed state agencies to bring every possible resource to bear to help these communities, these workers and their families."
We're getting children signed up for health coverage through Healthy Kids.
The University System established a scholarship fund so that students don't have to leave college.
"Working with Sen. Judd Gregg, we obtained federal grants to provide job retraining and extend unemployment benefits."
We're fighting in bankruptcy court to protect the idled mills from the harsh North Country winter.
My goal remains getting these mills operating again.
And I say to the people of the North Country: I will keep fighting to get you back to work.
"September 11th shook our economy, moving us faster toward the recession already hitting the rest of the country."
It is up to us to take on this economic battle with all the weapons in our fiscal arsenal.
We cannot afford to hesitate and simply hope for better times.
"We must put partisanship aside and take decisive action to make a difference now, for New Hampshire's workers, New Hampshire's businesses, New Hampshire's economic security."
Let me today outline my plan for getting our economy back on track and our people back to work.
"First, we must increase unemployment benefits."
I am proposing legislation that increases weekly benefits without raising payroll taxes.
"Our unemployment taxes are the second lowest in the nation, and I'm going to keep it that way."
"This bill will help laid-off workers pay for food, clothing, medical care, and other essentials."
"In turn, their spending will pump millions of dollars into the New Hampshire economy."
"Increasing unemployment benefits is the right thing to do for our workers, and the smart thing to do for our economy."
"Work with me and Sen. Bob Flanders, Reps. Burling and Bishop and the other sponsors of this bipartisan bill."
"The sooner we pass this bill, the sooner we begin helping workers who lose their jobs."
"Today, I ask you: fast track this legislation."
"Second, we must invest our tourism promotion dollars smartly."
Tourism provides billions of dollars to the state's economy and supports tens of thousands of jobs.
"In the past five years, with your approval, we have more than doubled our investment in tourism promotion."
So after September 11th we were able to move quickly to make New Hampshire a destination for people forced to change their travel plans.
"As a result, New Hampshire had a banner Columbus Day weekend."
I have directed our Division of Travel and Tourism to take every possible step to keep the industry strong.
We are expanding our advertising in Quebec to attract more visitors from Canada.
We are doing new in-state marketing to remind New Hampshire citizens of the great vacation opportunities right in their own backyard.
"Third, because state construction projects provide jobs and stimulate local economies, I've directed the Bureau of Public Works to speed up the projects included in the state's capital budget."
"As a result, over $87 million of capital projects will be put out to bid by July 1st."
"Fourth, our future prosperity depends on a sustained focus on the fundamentals of a strong economy."
"We will continue to implement the recommendations in our comprehensive economic strategy, New Hampshire in the New Economy."
"We must maintain our efforts to expand international trade, promote our high tech sector, increase telecommunications access, lower energy costs, and improve educational opportunities and job skills."
We must continue opening new global markets for New Hampshire companies.
We have invested in our International Trade Center so it can help companies get business in lucrative world markets.
"Trade missions I led to England and Ireland, to Denmark and Germany, and to Canada have generated an estimated $500 million in sales for New Hampshire businesses."
We must expand global opportunities for our workers and our businesses even more.
"Today, I am announcing that this May I will lead a trade mission to Mexico, one of New Hampshire's largest trading partners."
"We must continue to nurture our high tech sector and encourage new, cutting edge industries to locate in New Hampshire, like those exploring biotechnology."
"With the mapping of the human genome, we can now imagine cures to diseases from diabetes to cancer."
The State is working with businesses and higher education on a new initiative to attract biotech companies and jobs.
New Hampshire companies can and should be in the forefront of technology breakthroughs.
Recently many of us had an opportunity to ride one of those breakthroughs.
"Some scoff at Dean Kamen's Segway, just as 90 years ago, horse-and-buggy loyalists assumed that the automobile was a fad."
"I saw in Segway, as many of you did, a machine - invented and built right here in New Hampshire - that could revolutionize urban transportation."
It is in New Hampshire's interest for Segway to succeed.The future is now.
Pass Senator Klemm's legislation to allow the use of Segways on the sidewalks of New Hampshire.
We have come a long way in expanding access to the high-speed Internet connections that are as important to today's commerce as interstate highways.
"Per capita, we have more fiber optic cable than any other New England state, including Massachusetts, and more than California or New York."
Sixty-six percent of our citizens are connected to the Internet from their homes.
We are among the top ten states in the percentage of our companies doing business online.
"In the past year, we have formed public-private partnerships to create Monadnock and North Country Connects, giving businesses in rural parts of our state access to high-speed telecommunications at affordable prices."
We are now working with other communities to replicate this highly successful model.
"In New Hampshire, we know firsthand how important energy is to our economy."
That's why we've begun working on the state's first ever energy plan.
"We must develop a plan that increases energy efficiency, protects our environment and helps make us less dependent on foreign oil."
And we must keep working to bring down utility rates.
I took on PSNH and the other utilities to fight for lower electric rates.
"As a result of our work, families and businesses across New Hampshire saw their bills drop."
I will not stop until every part of New Hampshire has lower rates.
Businesses and families in Sullivan County are still paying too much to Connecticut Valley Electric Company.
"I say to the executives of CVEC over in Vermont: we did not forget you while we were wrestling with PSNH, and now you are in our sights."
We must make sure working people get the skills and job training they need to take advantage of new opportunities.
"Last session, with your support, we established a permanent job-training fund - a million dollars a year -- to help businesses and workers adapt to changing times."
"Last week, I announced that companies can now apply for matching grants through our new Job Training Program for Economic Growth."
"This program will help companies upgrade existing jobs and create new jobs, giving first priority to small businesses."
And we must continue making smart investments in our children's schools.
"Because we want the best teachers in our classrooms, we have toughened professional development standards and tested 2,000 new teachers."
The Best Schools Leadership Institute is helping 225 schools in 88 communities improve student performance.
School report cards now let parents see how their children's schools measure up.
We want our young people to stay here in New Hampshire for college.
Now we're giving them more reason to stay.
New financial incentives through Granite State Scholars.
A modern learning environment made possible by the largest capital investment ever made in our university system.
And more people now have access to higher education at a price they can afford because we've made it easier to transfer credits between our Community Technical Colleges and the University system.
"Because every child needs a strong start, we invested in the kindergarten incentive program."
Thirty-four communities have added public kindergarten.
"Because of our actions, nearly 7,000 additional children have had the benefit of public kindergarten."
"As a state, we have accepted the responsibility to ensure every child in every town the opportunity for a good education."
We cannot - and should not - ever go back to a system that shortchanged some students simply because of their zip code.
"If legislation gets to my desk that turns back the clock on our children's education, I will veto it."
We ended the last biennium with a general fund surplus of $35 million - allowing us to nearly triple our rainy day fund.
But the slowing economy is now affecting our state revenues.
We must continue to exercise fiscal discipline and responsibility.
I have issued an executive order reducing general fund spending by $6.5 million this fiscal year.
I will take further actions as necessary.
But this is a joint responsibility.
Do not pass spending bills this year unless you have identified how you are going to pay for them.
"In these tough economic times, we simply cannot afford it."
"Our economy is directly linked to the availability of quality, affordable health care."
We have done much in the last five years.
The HMO Accountability Act is making sure that HMO's are providing the health care people need and deserve.
"From an independent appeals process when HMO's deny care to protecting health care providers who stand up for their patients, the HMO Accountability Act is making a difference for New Hampshire families."
"Today, there are nearly 15,000 New Hampshire kids - almost as many people as live in the entire city of Laconia - who have health care because of the Children's Health Insurance Program."
"I have worked hard to expand health insurance for children, and my goal remains simple: enroll every eligible child."
"The increasing cost of prescription drugs is threatening our health care system, and I am working hard to address this problem."
The drug purchasing pool we launched in November with Vermont and Maine is expected to save us $7 million this fiscal year alone on the prescription drugs we provide to people on Medicaid.
This first in the nation program will save us more than $28 million over four years.
"Since 1999, our Senior Prescription Drug Program has helped more than 2,000 seniors save more than $2 million on their prescription drug costs."
"Time and again, the drug industry has gone to court to stop efforts by states to help seniors save on their medicines."
And they've lobbied nonstop to extend their patents and keep cheaper generic drugs off the shelves.
"This hurts our seniors, who can't afford the medicines they need to stay healthy."
"This hurts our businesses, whose health insurance premiums are skyrocketing."
"This hurts the State budget, which has seen its Medicaid costs rise."
"That's why I am working with other governors, businesses, and labor unions from across our country as part of a new coalition called Business for Affordable Medicine."
We are fighting to push Congress to close loopholes that big drug companies exploit to keep lower-priced generic drugs off the market.
I am determined to end the special breaks that leave consumers - young and old - paying too much.
Join me in standing up to the big drug companies.
New Hampshire is a special place.
Our beautiful environment is crucial to our economic strength and to the quality of our lives.
It is a legacy we want to leave our children.
It is a resource we must act now to protect.
We must work to save our open spaces.
Last year for the first time we provided significant funding for the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program.
"This year we have the chance to protect 171,500 acres in the northern part of our state - the IP lands."
This land supports wildlife and countless recreational activities - from hiking to snowmobiling.
It provides hundreds of jobs for loggers and forest products workers.
"The bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate and I have all agreed to bond up to $10 million for a conservation easement and the outright purchase of the most environmentally sensitive land, including the headwaters of the Connecticut River.Protect this precious land.Pass this legislation."
We must act now to protect our water.
This year we are experiencing the worst drought in fifty years.
"Water is a finite resource, the oil of the future."
I am proposing three bills to address our water needs.
We must protect our groundwater from big commercial withdrawals.
We must remove outdated barriers that prevent communities from working together.
We must put in place common-sense conservation measures.
"Join me and Senator McCarley, Rep. Musler and the other sponsors of bipartisan legislation to protect our water for the people it rightfully belongs to - the citizens of New Hampshire."
"And with the Clean Power Act, we can have cleaner air."
We have the opportunity to reduce air pollution from power plants that causes global warming and illnesses like asthma.
Representatives Bradley and Norelli and others have worked hard with me to craft what is sure to become model legislation.
"To the House, I say thank you for passing the Clean Power Act."
"To my former colleagues in the Senate, I urge you to stand with us for New Hampshire's environment and pass this important legislation."
"I am putting forward an ambitious, fiscally responsible agenda."
Nothing less will meet the challenges we face.
"The state of our state is strong, and our strengths can and will overcome our challenges."
"As we begin this new year, let us remember September 11th not only for what we lost, but also for what we gained: a new spirit, a new energy, and a new commitment to each other, to our communities, and to our country."
"This session, let us not forget that somewhere across the globe young New Hampshire men and women in uniform are risking their lives for us."
"We should ask ourselves each and every day, is what we are doing in this historic statehouse worthy of the sacrifice being made for us?"
Let us do the work of the people in such a way that we may answer yes.Thank you.
