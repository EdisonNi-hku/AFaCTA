Members of the 100th General Assembly.

Justices of the Supreme Court.
Members of the Cabinet.
My fellow Tennesseans.
I am proud to report to you, the people's elected representatives, on the state of our state and to present to you our administration's budget proposals for fiscal year 1998-99.
It's hard to name another moment in our state's history when Tennessee has been as well-positioned to seize the opportunities before us.
Our economy is growing; our citizens are confident; our state government is focused -- the state of our state is solid and strong.
Together, we have fostered one of the nation's best business climates.
The last three years have been Tennessee's three best years ever in attracting investment and creating jobs.
We've seen a net gain of 135,000 jobs since 1994.
More Tennesseans are working than ever before in our state's history, and personal income has risen by 10 percent over the last three years.
We have honored our state's long-standing bipartisan commitment to better schools.
Our Families First welfare reform program is succeeding beyond everyone's expectations.
Tennessee's welfare caseload has fallen by more than 37 percent -- two and a half times better than the national average.
We have made important improvements to Governor McWherter's legacy -- the TennCare program.
Because of TennCare, we are making important strides forward in health care: child immunization rates have reached an all-time high; teen pregnancy and infant mortality rates have fallen to all-time lows.
We recognized that a great many children in Tennessee are not getting the support they are due from absent parents, and we together enacted a law to revoke the drivers' and professional licenses of deadbeat parents.
Last year, child support collections rose by more than $13 million.
With your advice and support, we have reformed programs for children and consolidated them within a new Department of Children's Services.
I consider this one of the most important accomplishments of our administration.
Through Crisis Intervention Teams, we are helping families and children in trouble and reducing the number of children who need to be taken into state custody.
We have cut our average daily cost by more than 8 percent, while increasing services to children by over 19 percent.
And through a public-private partnership with Family and Children's Services in Nashville, we have established a model for adoption services statewide.
The program's results are astonishing: adoptions are up 71 percent, and the time a child must wait for adoption has been reduced from an average of three and a half years to just six and a half months!
The Department of Children's Services is more than a success story for state government.
It represents a safe, secure future for thousands of children.
It is a triumph in which we can all take great pride.
Legislators of both parties have joined us in enacting three tough crime- fighting packages to make Tennesseans safe in their neighborhoods.
We have abolished parole for the most violent repeat offenders; we have streamlined death penalty appeals; we have instituted drug testing for those on parole and probation, and we have begun the process of revising a juvenile code crafted in a far more innocent age.
We are building and maintaining one of the nation's best highway systems, and we are doing so on a pay-as-you-go basis, not through the bonds and borrowing that characterize most other states' highway programs.
We have been good stewards of our environment.
Our air and water are the cleanest they have been in the last 25 years.
Importantly, we have done all of these things without raising taxes on hard-working Tennesseans.
We have met the needs of our citizens and addressed the fundamental responsibilities of government, while living within the means of our taxpayers.
That is because of cooperation and bipartisanship in state government, among Democrats and Republicans, and between the legislative branch and the executive branch.
Amid a spirited competition of ideas, we generally find a way to work together and get things done.
Sadly, within the past few weeks, the flags atop this Capitol building have been lowered twice to mark the passing of two men who epitomized both that competitive fire and that cooperative spirit: Carl Koella, Republican of Townsend, 25 years a state senator; Jim Kennedy, Democrat of Nashville, deputy governor, chief of staff and confidant of Governor Ned McWherter; Both gave Tennessee their best; both left us too soon -- to the sadness of friends on both sides of the aisle.
Our prayers are with their families this evening.
Our state is a better place for their service and personal sacrifice.
The budget I present to you, like the others I have offered, sets priorities based on our administration's central goals: offering our children a safe, healthy start; excellence in education; increasing economic opportunity for Tennesseans; protecting public safety and health; and creating a more effective, efficient and focused state government.
Let me address those areas one at a time, beginning with the last -- effective, efficient, focused state government.
By doing government's work better and being more selective about what government's work is, we can best assure that our resources are focused on what's truly important to our citizens.
On our watch, we have cut the growth of government spending by more than half.
Our state's general obligation debt is among the lowest in the nation; our bond ratings are among the highest, and we spend less than one percent of our budget on debt service.
We have, with your support, assured that a portion of the state's revenue growth will be set aside each year in the Rainy Day Fund to provide our state with a reserve on which we can draw in times of genuine emergency.
This year, we make the first installment -- $25.6 million -- bringing our state's total reserves to $127 million the highest ever with the exception of a few months in 1993.
We have combined and consolidated programs and departments where it makes sense.
We have improved service, saved money and reduced the size of state government.
We have fewer state employees today than when we took office -- and our budget this year proposes the elimination of 1,049 unnecessary (and largely unfilled) positions.
Even as we have kept spending in check, we have made major new investments in priority areas.
We have paid for them by making smart, strategic cuts elsewhere.
This represents a fundamental and necessary departure from business-as-usual and government-as-always.
It recognizes that we can no longer count on ever-increasing sums from Washington and that we take quite enough from our citizens in taxes.
The budget which I present to you this evening is in keeping with my philosophy of government and true to the objectives we have jointly established for our state.
As required by our Constitution, it is a balanced budget.
In keeping with my convictions, it does not impose new taxes on the citizens of Tennessee.
We propose a budget of $15 billion, 408 million, including improvements of $330 million.
We focus considerable attention on the twin objectives of giving our children a safe, healthy start and an excellent education.
We provide: $51.8 million more for TennCare.
Part of that allows us to extend coverage to every Tennessean age 18-and-under who cannot otherwise get health insurance protection.
It also allows us to open TennCare enrollment to children in low-income working families who have access to insurance but cannot afford to buy it.
We propose to redirect a total of $19.3 million in various federal funds to improve quality and access to child care.
We raise the state's child care reimbursement rate from 55 to 65 percent.
We increase training opportunities for child care workers.
And, we increase inspections of child care facilities.
We provide an additional $1million for the Governor's Prevention Initiative.
It funds local programs to discourage teen pregnancy, and to keep kids in school, out of trouble and off drugs.
These funds will allow us to expand the number of funded programs from the present 36 to as many as 56.
We provide $3.1 million for an early childhood education pilot program for 3-and 4-year olds from low-income families.
In keeping with our state's bipartisan commitment to better schools and my determination to offer Tennessee's rising generation an excellent education, we provide an additional $83.4 million for K-12 education.
This maintains full funding of the Basic Education Program and raises our state's spending for public education to its highest level in history.
In return for increased funding, however, we must continue to insist on performance and accountability in public education.
This is the deal state government made with Tennessee's taxpayers in 1992, when the state raised taxes for education but required accountability and results in return.
Now, one of the fundamental reforms of the Education Improvement Act of 1992 is under attack -- the one that required appointed school superintendents who are accountable to school boards elected by the citizens.
There is legislation to undo that reform and break our state's bargain with our taxpayers.
That effort must be turned aside, and I ask you to do so.
Money alone doesn't assure good schools.
So I am asking the General Assembly to support our education initiatives.
First, I urge you to join me in creating competition and alternatives in public education by allowing the creation of charter schools.
Charter schools are public schools which include some of the best features of private schools.
Like public schools: They do not charge tuition; they are open to all who wish to attend; they are accountable to the governmental body that issues their charter.
Like private schools: They decide their own curriculum and who will teach it; they are self-governed, by educators and parents; they are free from most regulation; and they have as students only those children whose parents want them to go there.
I am a product of public schools.
I believe in the mission of public education.
My objective in establishing charter schools in Tennessee is to prod our public schools to become better -- especially in our urban centers, where schools lag in performance and where parents have fewer options for their children.
Let's give those children a chance at a better education.
Let's give parents a choice in the public schools their kids can attend.
I urge you to enact our charter school law.
Secondly, I ask you to join us in assuring that a high school diploma means something.
What it should tell you is that the graduate can read at the high school level; can express himself or herself clearly and well, orally and in writing; can do basic mathematics, including algebra; and understands basic concepts in science.
In short, it should tell you that the graduate is prepared for what comes next; more education or a good job.
For too many young people, a diploma means simply that they've put in their time.
Jane Walters, our commissioner of education, has visited virtually every school district in the state.
Last summer, she talked with a 19-year-old and shared his story with me.
He's a good kid -- never got into any trouble, worked hard in school, did everything his teachers asked of him, earned good grades.
But this young man didn't earn a single college credit last year because he spent two entire semesters taking remedial courses -- learning in college the things he should have been taught in high school.
Unfortunately, he's not alone.
This fall, roughly 38 percent of the freshmen in Tennessee's public colleges and universities are taking remedial courses.
I'm talking about true freshmen, 18- and 19-year olds fresh out of high school.
Thirty-eight percent are taking remedial courses.
The young man Jane Walters talked to is angry.
He believes we have let him down --and you know what?
He's right.
This boy did everything we expected of him, and then discovered that what we expected of him in high school wasn't much and wasn't nearly enough to prepare him for college and his life's work.
We have to make sure that a diploma means something.
We propose to test every high school student in reading, writing, math and science and to require that they pass them all in order to graduate.
If they don't pass, they will be taking remedial classes in those subjects until they do.
And they won't earn a diploma until they have mastered the material and passed the test.
If we'd had such a test for the young man Jane Walters talked with, he'd have known that, despite his good grades, he needed to learn more and do better.
It wouldn't have come as a surprise to him as a college freshman.
If you can't read at the high school level, if you can't write simple, declarative sentences, if you can't do basic math without a calculator -- you're not ready to graduate from high school, let alone get a decent job or go to college.
And we're not doing our children any favors telling them otherwise.
One of the most important lessons young people can learn is that actions carry consequences.
Our legislation allows the State Board of Education to establish consequences for students' work in high school -- tests students must pass in order to graduate.
This will give us diplomas that mean something.
It deserves your support.
Of course, we're not merely focusing on meeting the minimum.
We know that many of our high school students are capable of doing more advanced work.
For them, we are offering more opportunities to earn college credit through advanced placement courses.
We are also working to claim Tennessee's share of the funds set aside by the nation's telecommunication companies to help schools bring technology into the classroom.
Tennessee, with our ConnecTen program, was the first state in the nation to connect all of our students to a digital network.
Now, we stand to gain at least $25 million that our schools can use to expand those networks.
I thank the Tennessee Regulatory Agency for working with our Department of Education to assure that Tennessee qualifies for these funds.
Fully 15 percent of our state's General Fund is devoted to public higher education.
This year, I propose an increase of $20.3 million in the operating budgets of our public colleges and universities, plus an additional $3 million for instructional and research equipment and roughly $212 million in capital outlay and maintenance on our campuses.
This fully funds the capital outlay recommendations of the Higher Education Commission.
Investments in education and higher education help prepare our citizens for good jobs and rewarding careers.
We want them to be able to pursue those careers here in Tennessee.
That is why it is a major objective of our administration to develop a business climate that encourages the creation of good, high-paying jobs.
With the support of the General Assembly, we have made an excellent beginning.
Our taxes are low; our regulatory burden light.
For the second time in as many years, we have been able to cut workers' compensation premiums.
The government-imposed cost of doing business is lower in Tennessee than just about anywhere else in the country.
The strong economic performance we enjoy hasn't happened by accident.
We do a lot of things right in Tennessee.
One of those right things is the Tennessee Industrial Infrastructure Program.
Over the last 10 years, the TIIPs program has helped Tennessee reduce the number of Aeconomically depressed@ counties from 42 to only nine.
During our administration, TIIPs funds have been put to work in 89 of our 95 counties.
Our infrastructure investment of $29 million has attracted 82 times as much in private investment -- more than $2.4 billion worth.
Our administration has worked with Chairman Matt Kisber and the Business Tax Study Committee to improve on the TIIPs program.
Our budget increases TIIPs funding to $17.5 million.
We are also increasing our industrial recruitment budget to $3 million.
We are also investing in science and technology.
Two years ago, you joined me in promising $8 million to help bring the federal government's Spallation Neutron Source project to Oak Ridge.
Two weeks ago, Vice President Al Gore announced that Tennessee's early interest and enthusiasm had paid off.
Oak Ridge will be the site for the Spallation Neutron Source project.
This is a $1.3 billion development --exciting, cutting-edge research with important implications for America and the world.
The Oak Ridge/Knoxville/Chattanooga corridor is a magnet for job-creating investment -- the very heart and hub of Tennessee's continued growth and development in high technology fields.
Our budget makes good on our promise to Oak Ridge.
When our state was new, the founders put the word @agriculture@ on the state seal because, at the time, it was what just about everyone did for a living.
Today, far fewer Tennesseans make their living on the land, yet they produce in such abundance that agriculture remains one of our state's economic mainstays.
I ask you to join me in granting a sales tax exemption for farm equipment repair parts and labor.
This is a matter of equity and fairness for farmers.
We are extending them the same kind of tax treatment on equipment repair that our state has long extended to manufacturers and to those involved in warehousing and distribution.
It will cost the state relatively little in the way of revenue, but it sure will make a difference on the balance sheets for many farmers.
An important component of our effort to extend economic opportunity for Tennesseans is to assist those who have been left behind.
We continue to refine the welfare reforms we began in 1996.
It is a point of pride that we have reduced the welfare rolls from 91,000 to just over 56,000, but I promised at the start that we would measure success not just by the number who leave welfare, but by the number who successfully rejoin the mainstream of working Tennesseans.
The results so far are encouraging.
But we recognize that many who remain on welfare and who are now approaching the end of their 18-month limit on benefits are those who are the hardest to employ, those most in need of special education and training.
Our budget provides $11.9 million from federal sources for an expanded welfare-to-work initiative targeted to those hardest-to-employ cases.
And, as I mentioned, we are redirecting $15.2 million to increase the state's child care subsidies for mothers on welfare who are working to make a new start.
State government has a fundamental duty to protect our citizens.
That is especially true when disaster strikes: when a tornado levels a neighborhood in Murfreesboro or Chattanooga; when flood waters leave hundreds homeless in Carter County; when heavy snows or ice storms leave communities without electricity.
In those first desperate hours, our citizens have found help and comfort from the men and women who work for TEMA -- the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
We only hear about TEMA when there's trouble, but they are on guard 24 hours a day, every day -- anticipating problems, planning contingencies to meet them and training thousands of first responders across our state.
I'm convinced that our emergency management team is second to none, and Tennesseans can rest easier tonight, knowing that TEMA is on call.
TEMA's Director, John White, is here tonight; John, will you stand?
Our budget offers the protection of a health care safety net.
A portion of our $51 million TennCare increase will cover improved services for our citizens with mental illness and mental retardation.
We recognize our obligation to help these often-vulnerable citizens.
We have done our best to overcome problems in the system that had been left unaddressed for a very long time.
In the past three years, we have increased spending on these services by almost $191 million.
Let me emphasize that -- since our administration took office, we have increased spending on mental health and mental retardation services by $191 million.
That's a 30 percent increase.
We are trying to do better for these citizens.
One way we can do better is to complete the merger of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation with the Department of Health.
I want to emphasize that our legislation makes no change in mental health and mental retardation programs.
It guarantees them equal status with the health department's other divisions, and for the first time, assures that mental health and mental retardation have a presence in all 95 counties.
I ask you to complete the merger early in your session, so that we can better serve our citizens in need.
In the area of public safety, another obvious point of interest is the bold proposal to privatize the management of up to 70 percent of our state's prison system.
I strongly support it.
The legislation provides a careful, deliberate process under which private companies can compete for the right to manage our prisons.
It provides safeguards for state employees.
It spells out an orderly and well-supervised transition process.
And it holds out the prospect of budget savings of at least $25 million annually -- savings we can apply to programs that can prevent crime and that provide alcohol and drug treatment to first offenders.
We have an opportunity here to pioneer policy in corrections, just as our state earlier pioneered health care policy with TennCare and welfare reform with Families First.
I know you will give it your thorough review, and I am confident that many of you will reach the same conclusion I have -- that privatization is a sound proposal which deserves your support.
Several years ago, the chief justice likened our state court system to a dirt road linking the modern highways of law enforcement and prisons.
Since then, we have funded a number of improvements to our court system, and we do so again this year.
We also provide funding for the additional judges the General Assembly has created.
Last year, we funded the new TBI headquarters complex -- the first consolidated headquarters TBI has had in its 47-year history.
This year, we are funding a new TBI crime lab in Memphis, which has long needed one.
We have more troopers on the highway than at any time in our state's history, and later this spring, we will begin training the largest trooper class we've ever had.
Their vigilance has helped our state reduce the number of highway fatalities.
All of our communities and each of our citizens are made safer by the vigilance of our fire fighters, both professional and volunteer.
To ensure that they get the training and certification required, our budget provides $24.5 million for construction of a new fire academy.
As we have each year I have been governor, we offer several bills dealing with crime and criminals.
This year, I ask the General Assembly to join me in renewing our efforts to discourage people from drinking too much, and then getting behind the wheel, where they are a danger to themselves and others.
We need to send a clear, unequivocal signal that drunk driving is a crime -- not a mistake, not an accident, not a lapse in judgment -- a crime.
I ask you to lower the blood alcohol level for which one can be charged with DUI from the current .10 to .08.
This will encourage a great many Tennesseans to be more careful about getting behind the wheel when they've had too much to drink.
And for those who drink beyond sensibility -- the Ahard core@ drunk drivers with blood alcohol levels well above the legal limit -- we need to impose tougher penalties than just 48 hours in jail.
I also ask you to approve a bill allowing police to revoke on the spot the drivers' licenses of suspected drunk drivers who refuse to take blood-alcohol tests.
These measures send the clear signal that we view drunk driving as a serious threat to our safety and that our tolerance and understanding are at an end.
The public's health and safety, as well as our sense of well-being, is closely linked to the quality of our environment.
I am proud to report to you that Tennessee's air, water and lands are cleaner today than they have been at any time in the last 25 years.
In the past year, we have reached a precedent-setting agreement to protect the Great Smoky Mountains.
We have broken a long-standing deadlock to win an agreement that will clean-up the Pigeon River in East Tennessee and end a century of injustice to the citizens who live along its course.
Last year, we expanded the State Revolving Loan Program by creating a drinking water fund on which communities can draw to make improvements to their water systems.
This year, we provide an additional $3.3 million for that purpose, enabling us to claim more than $30 million in federal matching funds for clean water in Tennessee.
We are also providing an additional $12 million for maintenance operations in our state parks, so that these Tennessee treasures continue to provide our citizens and visitors with opportunities for recreation and the quiet enjoyment of our state's natural beauty.
We take seriously our obligation to be good stewards of our state's natural resources, so that they will be here in all their splendor for future generations.
Governor Wilder, Speaker Naifeh, members of the 100th General Assembly.
because of our common efforts, future generations will be able to look back with favor on our work in these closing years of the 20th century.
They will do so because we focused on creating -- not entitlement -- but opportunity.
They will recall that we encouraged the energy and initiative of our citizens and kept alive their dreams of a brighter future.
Years ago, a school boy in rural West Tennessee wrote of his life and his dreams: AI am a sharecropper's son.
I work very hard for what I have to eat, and a place to stay warm in the winter.
My favorite fruit is the orange, although I don't get very many oranges.
I love my Mama and Daddy, and my two brothers, Jay and Clayton.
And I don't want to grow up to be a man like Hitler.
Someday I want to be a big radio star.
Thank you.
It's signed, Carl Perkins.
He did become a big radio star and one of the legends of rock and roll.
Carl had it harder coming up than many of us, but like kids everywhere, he had big dreams.
I like to think that we grown-ups have big dreams, too.
All of the things our children want to be, we want to help them become.
Let's build on the bright beginnings we have made together, and make Tennessee, truly, a state of opportunity for each of our citizens.
Thank you.
May God bless Tennessee and the United States of America.
