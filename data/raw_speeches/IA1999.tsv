GOVERNORS FULTON, RAY AND BRANSTAD, LT. GOVERNORS PEDERSON, CORNING AND ZIMMERMAN, CHIEF JUSTICE MCGIVERN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COURT AND JUDICIARY, HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY - PAST AND PRESENT, EXECUTIVE COUNSEL MEMBERS AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: TODAY IS A DAY OF PASSAGES IN THE STATE OF IOWA, AS WE INAUGURATE A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAWNING OF A NEW MILLENNIUM.
IT IS A DAY TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE US, TO TAKE STOCK OF WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE, AND TO TAKE AIM AT WHERE WE WANT TO GO.
BEFORE I SPEAK OF THE FUTURE LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT GOVERNOR BRANSTAD AND LT.
GOVERNOR CORNING AND THEIR FAMILIES.
GOVERNOR AND LT. GOVERNOR- YOU HAVE LED US DURING THE BEST OF TIMES AND THROUGH SOME OF THE WORST OF TIMES.
YOU HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND TO DIVERSIFY AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE’S ECONOMY.
YOU HAVE WORKED FOR OVER TWO DECADES FOR THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE - TO MAKE IOWA A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE- AND YOU LEAVE OFFICE HAVING DONE SO.
ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL PEOPLE I EXTEND OUR DEEPEST APPRECIATION TO YOU AND TO YOUR FAMILIES FOR THE SACRIFICES YOU HAVE MADE ON OUR BEHALF.
TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO I FOLLOWED MY HEART TO IOWA.
MY WIFE, CHRISTIE, AND I SETTLED IN HER HOMETOWN OF MT.
PLEASANT.
WE WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO FAMILY.
OUR HOPES AND DREAMS WERE SIMPLE.
WE WISHED TO RAISE OUR OWN FAMILY IN A CARING, WARM, AND NURTURING COMMUNITY.
OUR TWO SONS, JESS AND DOUG BENEFITTED BY THAT DECISION.
EACH DAY THEY GIVE US REASON TO BE PROUD.
DURING THOSE TWENTY THREE YEARS I’VE LEARNED OF IOWA’S GREATNESS.
IT STARTS WITH ITS BOUNTIFUL NATURAL RESOURCES, ACRES OF RICH BLACK SOIL AND MILES OF MEANDERING STREAMS AND RIVERS.
BUT ITS REAL GREATNESS LIES IN ITS MOST ENDURING QUALITY - ITS GOODNESS.
IOWA IS GREAT BECAUSE IOWA IS GOOD.
LET ME REPEAT THAT IOWA IS GREAT BECAUSE IOWA IS GOOD.
OUR GOODNESS ARISES FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL GOODNESS OF OUR PEOPLE - CARING, HARD WORKING, WELL EDUCATED, AND DECENT.
FROM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO DIRECT CARE STAFF AT NURSING HOMES, FROM TEACHERS TO SOCIAL WORKERS, FROM FARMERS TO FACTORY WORKERS, FROM VETERANS TO VOLUNTEERS – CARING, HARD-WORKING, WELL EDUCATED AND DECENT.
NO WHERE IS OUR GOODNESS, AND THEREFORE OUR GREATNESS, BETTER DISPLAYED THAN IN OUR DEDICATION TO FAMILY AND COMMUNITY.
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY IS HOW AND WHERE WE RAISE OUR CHILDREN AND CARE FOR EACH OTHER.
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY IS HOW AND WHERE WE TEACH OUR VALUES, HOW AND WHERE WE MOLD OUR AMBITIONS AND OUR ASPIRATIONS , AND HOW AND WHERE TODAY’S DREAMS BECOME TOMORROW’S IOWA.
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY - MORE THAN GENETICS AND GEOGRAPHY- THEY ARE OUR COLLECTIVE FRAME OF MIND, OUR WAY OF LIVING, AND OUR SHARED VISION OF HOW WE WANT TO BE.
AT THE OUTSET I SPOKE OF THE DAWNING OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM AND OF CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY.
STATED SIMPLY OUR CHALLENGE AT THE CLOSE OF THIS CENTURY AND AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CENTURY IS TO PRESERVE WHAT IS BEST ABOUT IOWA AND TO MAKE IT BETTER.
WE MUST DEDICATE OURSELVES TO PRESERVING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES - OUR LAND, WATER AND AIR AND TO PRESERVING THE BEST OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY WHILE ADAPTING EACH TO THE CHANGING WORLD THAT SURROUNDS US.
MAKING OUR BEST - BETTER WILL NOT BE EASY.
WE WILL BE CHALLENGED TO CHANGE.
TO PRESERVE AND TO ENHANCE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, WE MUST RETHINK WHAT WE DO WITH OUR LAND, OUR WATER, AND OUR AIR.
WE MUST BE GOOD STEWARDS AND REDEDICATE OURSELVES TO RESTORING AND CONSERVING THE LAND, TO CLEANING UP THE WATER, AND TO PROTECTING THE AIR.
IT IS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES THAT HOLD THE KEY TO A STRONGER, MORE PROSPEROUS IOWA.
IF WE ARE ABLE TO MIX GOOD OLD - IOWA COMMON SENSE WITH CHANGING SCIENCE WE CAN ENRICH OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND SECURE A BETTER TODAY AND DECADES OF BETTER TOMORROWS.
CONSTANT AND UNRELENTING CHANGE CHALLENGES OUR NOTION OF FAMILY.
FOR MANY OF US FAMILY IS NOT SIMPLY DEFINED.
STEP FAMILIES, FOSTER FAMILIES, ADOPTED FAMILIES , SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS TODAY REDEFINE FAMILY.
WE LIVE LIFE AT AN EVER ACCELERATING PACE AS WE INCORPORATE TECHNOLOGY INTO EVERY DAY LIFE.
ADAPTING TO CHANGING LIFESTYLES AND MANAGING THE HECTIC PACE OF LIFE WHILE PRESERVING WHAT IS BEST ABOUT FAMILY WILL REQUIRE INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM.
ONE OF THE KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL FAMILY LIFE IS A GOOD EDUCATION.
IOWA HAS HAD A LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION.
TO MAINTAIN THAT TRADITION AND TO BUILD UPON IT FOR STRONGER IOWA FAMILIES WILL REQUIRE US TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EDUCATION AND TO BE PREPARED TO INVEST IN IT.
IN THE FACE OF GROWING RESEARCH, WE CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT AN EDUCATION STARTS WITH KINDERGARTEN.
AN EDUCATION BEGINS AT BIRTH.
WITH NEW JOBS BEING CREATED EVERY DAY, AND NEW SKILLS BEING REQUIRED EVERY DAY WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO ALLOW GRADUATION TO SIGNAL THE END OF AN IOWAN’S EDUCATION.
IN IOWA AN EDUCATION NEVER ENDS - IT IS LIFELONG.
WE MUST CREATE A LIFELONG LEARNING SYSTEM.
WE MUST BE WILLING TO HELP EQUIP PARENTS TO BE THEIR CHILD’S FIRST AND BEST TEACHERS.
WE MUST INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO ALL OF OUR CHILDREN START SCHOOL READY TO LEARN.
WE MUST REDUCE CLASS SIZES IN THE EARLY GRADES AND IMPROVE TEACHER TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THE BASICS ARE TAUGHT WELL - TO LAY A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE LEARNING.
WE MUST INSTILL IN EACH STUDENT THE KNOWLEDGE THEY WILL INDIVIDUALLY NEED TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS.
OUR CHILDREN MUST HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND MASTER ITS USE.
WE MUST ALWAYS BE SURE THAT WHAT WE TEACH IS WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN.
IN SHORT WE MUST CREATE AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT EMBODIES EXCELLENCE AND THAT ENABLES EVERYONE TO LEARN WELL.
LET US STRIVE FOR A WORLD CLASS EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM PRE-SCHOOL TO GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE NATION AND THE WORLD.
NOTHING SHORT OF THAT COMMITMENT WILL ENABLE US TO HOLD TRUE TO THE TRADITIONS OF OUR PAST AND INSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR FUTURE.
WITH A REAL COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF US TODAY’S DREAM OF A QUALITY EDUCATION, WILL BUILD STRONGER FAMILIES FOR IOWA’S TOMORROW.
AT THE HEART OF OUR SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS A SHARED CONCERN FOR EACH OTHER.
TODAY WE FACE STERN CHALLENGES TO THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY.
EVERY DAY DANGEROUS DRUGS ARE SHIPPED INTO OUR STATE , GROWN IN OUR FIELDS, OR MADE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.
EACH DECADE THE DRUGS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS, MORE ADDICTING, AND MORE DEVASTATING.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR EACH OF US TO RECOGNIZE A PERSONAL DUTY.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR EACH OF US TO SEND A STRONG AND CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.
WHILE WE WILL AND WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN DO TO STOP THE SUPPLY OF THESE DRUGS - WE WILL NEVER SUCCEED UNTIL WE STOP THE DEMAND FOR THESE DRUGS.
EVERY ADULT IN THIS STATE THAT WORKS WITH OR CARES FOR THE CHILDREN OF THIS STATE SHOULD ACCEPT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DRUGS OF ALL KINDS - CIGARETTES, ALCOHOL, MARIJUANA , AND THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL METH.
TO HELP THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING DRUGS AND BECOME ADDICTED TO THEM WE MUST DEDICATE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT.
AND FOR THOSE WHO FAIL TO HEED OUR COMMUNITY’S WARNING ABOUT DEALING IN DRUGS, WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO RESPOND WITH SWIFT, SURE, AND APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT.
WHETHER WE PROVIDE QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS - OUR YOUNG CHILDREN, OUR FRAIL ELDERLY, AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF OUR DEDICATION TO COMMUNITY.
EVERY DAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR CHILDREN GO WITHOUT BASIC HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEIR WORKING PARENTS CAN NOT AFFORD THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE.
COUNTLESS TIMES I HAVE SEEN COMMUNITIES RESPOND WHEN A CHILD WAS IN NEED.
WHY - BECAUSE WE ARE A PEOPLE - A COMMUNITY WITH A TRADITION OF HELPING THOSE IN NEED.
LET US STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITY BY EXTENDING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF OUR CHILDREN.
AT THE SAME TIME LET US RECOGNIZE THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY TO REACH OUT TO PROTECT OUR FRAIL ELDERLY AND TO ASSIST THOSE WITH DISABILITIES.
WITH A REAL COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF US TODAY’S DREAM OF A DRUG FREE IOWA WHERE OUR MOST VULNERABLE HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC AND QUALITY HEALTH CARE WILL BUILD STRONGER COMMUNITIES FOR TOMORROW’S IOWA.
TODAY IN IOWA, HUNDREDS OF IOWA’S BEST FARMERS AND IOWA’S BEST WORKERS FACE A TOMORROW OF REAL UNCERTAINTY.
LET US PROMISE TODAY THAT WE WILL NOT FORGET THEIR STRUGGLE.
LET US PLEDGE TODAY THAT WE WILL ACT SWIFTLY AND DECISIVELY TO HELP WHEN AND WHERE HELP IS NEEDED MOST.
CHANGES IN AGRICULTURE AND EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COMMERCIAL CENTERS CREATES AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY.
WE OFTEN SPEAK AS IF THERE WERE TWO IOWANS - ONE RURAL AND ONE URBAN.
IF WE ARE TO THRIVE WE MUST DO SO AS ONE AND WE WILL DO SO AS ONE.
COMBINING OUR RICH SOIL, OUR STRONG WORK ETHIC, AND QUALITY EDUCATION SYSTEM WE CAN UNLEASH THE ECONOMIC POWER OF EVERY KERNEL OF CORN AND EVERY SOYBEAN GROWN IN OUR FIELDS.
AS THE FOOD CAPITAL OF THE WORLD WE CAN ADD REAL VALUE TO OUR CROPS AND OPEN UP NEW MARKETS IN THE STATE GIVING HOPE TO OUR FARMERS.
AT THE SAME TIME WITH EACH NEW PRODUCT COMES THE NEED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, FOR PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING, AND FOR MARKETING THAT CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGH TECH - HIGH PAYING JOBS IN COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES.
WITH A REAL COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF US TODAY’S DREAM OF IOWA AS THE FOOD CAPITAL WILL BUILD A BRIGHTER ECONOMIC FUTURE IN TOMORROW’S IOWA.
WITH A SENSE OF HOPE AND EXCITEMENT WE ENTER A NEW CENTURY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ECONOMY NOT BUILT SOLELY ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR BODIES BUT MORE ON THE POWER OF OUR INTELLECT.
IOWA IS POISED TO TAKE REAL ADVANTAGE OF THAT NEW ECONOMY AND TO OFFER BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES THAT LOCATE HERE THE PROMISE OF LONG- TERM PROFITABILITY BUILT ON THE QUALITY OF OUR WORKERS AND OUR LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN THEIR CONTINUED EDUCATION.
OUR POPULATION IS STABLE BUT TO REALIZE THE PROMISE OF THE FUTURE WE MUST BE ABLE TO RETAIN AND TO ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE TO OUR STATE.
LET ME START BY INVITING MY OWN SONS TO MAKE IOWA THEIR LIFETIME HOME AND TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO INVITE THE CHILDREN OF OUR STATE TO BE A PART OF ITS FUTURE.
TO JESS AND DOUG AND TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THIS STATE, I SAY WE NEED YOU.
OUR STATE’S FUTURE DEPENDS UPON YOU INTELLECT, YOUR CREATIVITY, YOUR ENERGY.
I REALIZE THAT IF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TO STAY OR COME BACK HOME, WE MUST DO OUR PART BEFORE WE ASK THEM TO DO THEIR PART.
WE MUST INVEST IN SCHOOLS.
WE MUST SUPPORT THE ARTS.
WE MUST EXPAND CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND OPPORTUNITY.
WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF RECREATION.
LET US SEAL THAT BARGAIN TODAY FOR A BETTER IOWA TOMORROW.
"TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, LET ME REPEAT WHAT GOVERNOR HAROLD HUGHES SAID IN HIS FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND I QUOTE: ""AS WE MEET, THE QUESTION UPPERMOST IN THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS WE REPRESENT IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY AND I THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR CAN WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A CONSTRUCTIVE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE."
AS I SEE IT WE HAVE NO CHOICE- IF WE ARE TO KEEP FAITH WITH OUR OATHS OF OFFICE.
"HE WENT ON TO SAY ON THAT DAY : "" OUR CONSTITUTION STATES THAT ALL POLITICAL POWER IS INHERENT IN THE PEOPLE."
THE PEOPLE OF IOWA ELECTED A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR.
THEY ELECTED A LARGE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE ASSEMBLY.
THEY EXPECT US TO DO OUR JOBS REGARDLESS OF PARTY LABELS.
YET NOW THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER AND WE PROCEED TO THE CONSTRUCTIVE TASKS OF LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATION, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE DIFFERENCES THAT DIVIDE US AS PARTISANS ARE SMALL BY COMPARISON WITH THE COMMON GROUND THAT UNITES US A FELLOW IOWANS.
WE WANT A BETTER, MORE PROGRESSIVE, MORE PROSPEROUS IOWA.
TO ATTAIN IT WE MUST SEEK BOTH UNITY AND CONTINUITY IN GOVERNMENT.
I BELIEVE GOVERNOR HUGHES SAID IT AS WELL AS IT COULD BE SAID.
A BETTER - MORE PROGRESSIVE - MORE PROSPEROUS IOWA WILL NOT EVOLVE BY AND THROUGH GOVERNMENT ALONE.
WE MUST HAVE A CLEAR VISION OF THE IOWA OF THE FUTURE.
HOW WOULD EACH OF US ANSWER THE QUESTION – WHAT SHOULD IOWA BE IN THE YEAR 2020?
WHAT KIND OF STATE DO WE WANT AND NEED?
WE MUST ASK THOSE QUESTIONS NOW – AND, WE ANSWER THEM THOUGHTFULLY NOW - FOR A BETTER IOWA.
WE MUST STRATEGICALLY PLAN OUR FUTURE.
FUTURE SUCCESS WILL REQUIRE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE NON- PROFIT SECTOR TO ACHIEVE OUR COMMON GOAL.
BUILDING AND CREATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
LT.
GOVERNOR PEDERSON KNOWS HOW TO BUILD SUCH PARTNERSHIPS.
WE WILL WORK TOGETHER - DRAWING ON OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES TO MOVE IOWA FORWARD.
TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO I FOLLOWED MY HEART TO IOWA - NOW MY HEART AND MY SOUL BELONG TO OUR STATE.
AS SOMEONE FOR WHOM LIFE STARTED IN AN ORPHANAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO BE A HUSBAND, A FATHER, A LAWYER, A MAYOR, AND A STATE SENATOR.
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HONOR TO STAND HERE AS YOUR GOVERNOR - EMBRACED BY THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY WE CALL IOWA.
LET US WORK TOGETHER FOR A BETTER IOWA.
LET US NOT FORGET THAT IOWA IS GREAT BECAUSE IOWA IS GOOD.
LET US MAKE TODAY’S DREAMS TOMORROW’S IOWA.
"IF WE DO, WE SAY AGAIN WHAT WAS SAID BY SAMUEL KIRKWOOD MORE THAN 100 YEARS AGO – ""IOWA – OUR EYES HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BEHOLD ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF HER GLORY."
THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
