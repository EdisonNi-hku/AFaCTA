sentences
Good morning and thank you for joining me.
It is an honor to address you today.
This year - and I suspect for the rest of my life - today, January 21st, will hold a very specific meaning.
It was one year ago today, on January 21st 2020, that I established an incident management team to prepare for the possibility of the coronavirus coming to Oregon.
We did not know what lay ahead.
Whether the race would be short and steep.
Or long and arduous.
But, we knew that if COVID-19 reached Oregon, we must be prepared.
Now, we know we were in it for the long haul; we were preparing to run a marathon.
Just five weeks later, on February 28th, we had our first positive case of coronavirus in Oregon.
It was just the second person in the country confirmed positive who had not traveled abroad.
The starting shot had been fired into the air.
And the long race had begun.
For most of us, in a marathon, you are not racing against others.
You are racing against yourself, against time, and pushing your own limits.
You must constantly monitor your performance, adjust your pace, and keep your eyes on the finish line.
The goal is not only to finish, but to finish strong.
Three weeks after our first positive case, I closed schools and issued Oregon’s Stay Home, Save Lives order.
Some folks said it was too rash.
Others said it was too late.
It was the first adjustment that we had to make in this race.
We were falling off our pace.
When I decided to close restaurants and entertainment venues but keep construction and manufacturing open, some said this action was too much.
Others said it was too little.
But by April, we were back on track.
We even were able to send ventilators to parts of the country that needed them more than Oregon.
We were showing endurance early on in this marathon.
We were ready to take the next cautious step.
In May we began reopening businesses, taking a county-by-county approach.
Some said it was too cautious.
Others thought it was too risky.
We paced ourselves again, adjusting reopening guidelines and establishing the watch list for counties.
Constantly monitoring our performance and adjusting as we ran.
At the end of May and into June, the untimely deaths of Black and Brown neighbors from across the country inspired Oregonians to march in our streets with a long overdue clarion call for racial justice.
Many of us were awakening to what has always been true.
Our Black, Latinx, Pacific Islander, and other communities of color are disproportionately impacted by the crises that befall our nation.
As the rest of the country saw a dangerous summer surge, we did too.
But, our curve was less severe.
Oregonians were holding strong.
The overwhelming majority were wearing masks and limiting gatherings.
Then came September; fires suddenly and furiously swept through our state.
Our friends and neighbors lost their homes, entire towns were wiped off the map, and smoke filled our skies for weeks.
We lost 9 Oregonians.
We lost more than 4,000 homes.
More than 1.2 million acres burned.
And just as we began to steady ourselves from the most devastating wildfires in Oregon’s history, the pandemic’s second wave hit us last fall.
We had to take drastic measures again.
This marathon.
The marathon of 2020 was proving relentless.
Yet, many still said that my orders were too restrictive, that the virus isn’t dangerous or that it’s a hoax.
All the while, cases were rising and deaths continued to mount.
The truth is, those commenting on the far ends of this debate were missing the point.
In a short race, like the 100-meter dash, you run as hard as you can for a short period of time.
In a marathon, you have to play the long game.
Your eyes must remain fixed on the horizon.
And just when you think you can’t keep going, you take one more step.
And even when you’re close to the finish line, the final stretch can be the most challenging of all.
As vaccines arrived in Oregon, suddenly the finish line appeared.
And yet, we had to slow our lives down once again, adjust our routines, and make sacrifices over the holidays.
And while we saw record cases and a heartbreaking amount of deaths, Oregonians are still faring better than most of the country.
Now, one year after we began to prepare for the pandemic, we can see the finish line.
But the race is far from over.
And yet, because we were cautious.
Because we listened to experts.
Because we wore masks and limited our gatherings.
Because we enforced health and safety rules in businesses.
We, as Oregonians, will finish this marathon, and we will finish strong.
Today, Oregon has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates in the country.
And our daily case counts are among the lowest in the country.
I directed OHA to speed up our efforts and we are now administering at least 12,000 vaccines per day.
On some days, we’ve administered twice that amount.
Our health care providers, hospitals, pharmacies, local public health partners, and our National Guard have all stepped up and are working together to streamline the distribution process and vaccinate Oregonians more quickly.
I want to thank every Oregonian, every business, every local elected official who sacrificed to put us in this position.
Thank you for the sacrifices you’ve made.
The love that you’ve shown for your families, your friends, neighbors, and the entire state.
As the finish line comes into view, I know that many of you are beginning to imagine what life might be like once we reach it.
Yet, we must recognize that going back to the “way things were” will not move us forward.
Every difficult turn of this past year has only proven this point, further exacerbating existing disparities for Oregon’s Black, Indigenous, Latino, Latina, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Tribal communities.
The first step to creating opportunity is recognizing that racism is endemic to our systems, impacting every part of our culture and our economy.
I am committed to ensuring that the world we build as we emerge from this last year is a more equitable one.
We must build back better.
As we move forward as a state, we must look back, too.
To take stock of the more than 1,600 Oregon lives that were lost in the pandemic.
With each life comes a story.
And over the last year, each life lost also tells the story of those that worked so hard to save it.
I want to share with you just one of those people.
Dr. Antwon Chavis is a pediatrician at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, who is living through the pandemic through our children’s experiences.
I know Oregon will recover from these turbulent times.
But we can’t do this alone.
My proposed budget doesn’t put enough money into our schools, it doesn’t make all of the investments in public health we need.
It’s a budget built on sacrifice and hard choices.
And while our state can deliver the core services that Oregonians expect us to, it doesn’t go far enough to heal the pain of 2020.
If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that everyone—every Oregonian—deserves access to affordable health care.
I have proposed investments in my budget to expand this access, but, I also expect the Biden-Harris administration to help us financially.
Together we must ensure that every single Oregonian has access to this human right.
At the same time we need to continue the pioneering work that Oregon has done to reduce the cost of health care.
Last session I was pleased to sign SB 889, which brought hospitals, insurers, and worker representatives together to lower costs for Oregonians.
Earlier this month, the SB 889 workgroup unanimously approved a framework that will make Oregon a place where people are paying for the quality of the care they get rather than the number of times they visit a doctor’s office.
I’m committed to moving this framework forward immediately.
Finally, as we have seen with the pandemic, broadband, access to the internet, is an essential service just like our electricity.
Our kids need it to participate in class, our businesses need it to connect to customers, and our communities rely on it to provide services to their people.
My budget invests over $100 million in broadband expansion statewide, with a focus on providing access to communities that have been disproportionately impacted during the pandemic, and ensuring every single school across Oregon is connected to the internet.
This could be a bridge that helps Oregon mend the urban rural divide.
And the disparities in access aren’t just a problem here, but across the country.
The Biden-Harris administration can help unite this unnecessary division, especially in the west, by providing federal funding for broadband expansion.
This year, the West was also disproportionately impacted by one of the consequences of climate change—wildfire.
In a historic event, hot, dry, winds brought on a wildfire emergency that our state has never seen before.
None of us will ever forget the blood red sky.
We will never forget what it was like to see thousands of homes burn.
We will never forget the lives lost.
And we will never forget the sacrifices made by our firefighters, first responders, and emergency managers who saved lives and risked their own.
During the wildfires and even today - months later - I am ever more grateful for the acts of compassion and support I’m seeing in every community across the state.
Even in the darkest of times, Oregonians are stepping up to help one another in extraordinary ways.
I want you to meet just one of these inspiring Oregonians, Chief Christina Rainbow Plews of the volunteer Upper McKenzie Fire and Rescue Department.
Many of you likely know of Chief Rainbow’s heroism, protecting her community from fire even while her own home burned.
Stories like Chief Rainbow’s are what tell me that no matter what, we are resilient in the face of so much challenge.
Oregonians give me confidence that we will come out of this disaster, and we will be stronger for it.
For example, we have removed 150 tons of household hazardous materials from nearly 2,300 properties.
Opened up 240 miles of roads.
And we continue to shelter and feed over 1,000 wildfire survivors and work to transition these individuals to intermediate housing options.
There is much work left to do in order to have a full recovery.
At the same time, we must continue to prepare our communities and our landscapes for these more challenging fire seasons.
That starts with creating fire-adapted communities to protect our people and the houses they live in.
We will invest in the Office of Emergency Management to help communities create response plans and fire evacuation routes, and bolster smoke shelter programs at the Oregon Health Authority.
Second, we must respond safely and effectively to active fires.
This means putting more boots on the ground and investing in new technology, like the next generation of air tankers.
Third, we must prevent fire by creating healthier landscapes.
That means coordinating thinning and controlled burning during our wet season to reduce fire risk and increase the odds for firefighters.
While climate change, population growth, and record fuel levels combine to create a growing wildfire debt, an immediate response to mitigate fire risks is required.
Racism and racial disparities impact every single part of our culture and our economy.
The dual crisis of the pandemic and fires has only accelerated these disparities.
We know that all Oregonians felt the impacts of the emergencies our state weathered last year.
But, the impacts are not felt equally.
That’s why our state budget and policies must be built on a foundation of racial equity and inclusion.
I convened the Racial Justice Council last year to guide that work.
We confronted some of the most important issues that Oregonians face with the recognition that much of our lives are inextricably tied up in our state’s dark history of racism.
For far too long in Oregon, our Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and Tribal members haven’t had a meaningful seat at the table.
But, as Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm said, “If they don’t offer you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.
I think, in Oregon, we can do much better than that.
I want to introduce you to two members of the Racial Justice Council, Reyna Lopez and Paul Solomon.
Our state’s — and our nation’s — long history of racist policies won’t be deconstructed in one budget cycle.
Every step matters, so across my budget, I’ve found ways to make over $280 million in investments prioritized by the Racial Justice Council.
This budget begins the process of recognizing and undoing systemic racism in Oregon.
But, my fellow Oregonians, I have to be honest with you.
This is only the beginning.
We are going to have to deploy every resource, every tool, and every creative idea to make progress towards reversing the stain racism has left on our state.
And it starts with education.
That’s why my vision is, and will always remain, creating a seamless system of education from cradle to career.
I have invested more than $10 billion in K-12 schools and early childhood education, including investments that prioritize career and technical education, access to wrap-around services, such as nutritional support, and building an antiracist curriculum that is honest about the past.
We will also continue to make progress toward stomping out the opportunity gap by ensuring 8,000 more kids are eligible for home visiting, early head start, and preschool promise.
No one - no one - should be kicked out of their home in the midst of a pandemic.
In Oregon it was a team effort by the Legislature and my administration to ensure that this did not happen.
Thanks to Speaker Kotek and President Courtney for their leadership.
And late in the year, Congress finally passed an extension of the eviction moratorium and financial assistance for renters and homeowners struggling to make payments.
This is only a drop in the bucket.
There is much more to do to ensure more Oregon families have a warm, safe, dry place to call home.
My budget continues our $250 million investment in affordable housing, homelesness prevention, and rental assistance.
We have also included more than $20 million to help provide a pathway to homeownership for Black, Indigenous, Latino, Latina, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Tribal communities, as well as adding co-op and land trust models to our system.
And as we have learned from Reyna and Paul, we cannot continue to operate with two systems of justice in our country.
One that benefits the wealthy and harms the poor.
One that endangers the lives of Black people going out for a jog or wearing a hoodie.
Or one that lets white supremacists storm the U. S. Capitol undeterred.
Oregon is evolving, out of necessity and out of hope.
Our policies and practices are changing as we do more listening to those who’ve been most harmed.
Together, these are the steps we must take to begin the work of dismantling racism.
Sadly, not everyone in this country believes this.
We have seen violence in the name of nationalism, and white supremacy veiled as patriotism.
We have also seen these hatreds expressed in our communities here at home as they play out in our nation’s capitol.
The intense challenges of 2020 have only reminded us that the foundations of our democracy must remain strong.
Now, more than ever, we must fortify the institution that defines us.
Voting is a basic, beloved, and essential tenet of democracy; it represents our country's greatest collective strength.
And yet, today, the fundamental right itself, the very act of voting, has become a political tool for reapportioning power.
In recent years, both the federal government and many states have moved toward more restrictive voter registration laws and policies.
And like so many reactionary policies proposed in the name of security, you don't have to scratch the veneer very hard to reveal the fear, racism - and political ambition - concealed within.
That’s why I am committed to strengthening this country’s democracy.
And it starts right here, right in this building.
Because in Oregon, voting is a proud part of who we are.
It’s in our very DNA.
We were the first state in the country to institute voting by mail and to establish automatic voter registration.
And today, a remarkable 92 percent of eligible Oregonians are registered to vote, and Oregon voters showed up in record numbers to cast their ballots in the 2020 election.
And in the midst of incredible political divides and a pandemic, Oregon’s 30-year-old Vote-by- Mail system suddenly took a turn on the national stage.
States across the country shifted to voting by mail, and voting early, to enable voters to vote safely and securely.
While Oregon’s accomplishments are significant, our work is not finished.
We must continue to fortify the voting infrastructure we have to ensure that every voice is heard.
We must expand our automatic voter registration program, to include other state agencies who have the capacity to fully capture eligible voters’ data safely and securely.
Why?
Because voter registration should be safe and easy, whether interacting with the DMV or another state service.
We should also allow same-day voter registration and ballots to be counted as long as they’ve been postmarked by election day.
At a time when there has never been more scrutiny laid on the systems through which we vote, Oregon set the example and charted the path to a more safe, secure, accessible, and verifiable voting system.
I will advocate for Oregon’s innovations in voting to be implemented at the national level.
Automatic Voter Registration and Vote by Mail should be available to every citizen in this country.
The right to vote is fundamental, it is sacred.
Your vote is your voice.
And in Oregon, as it should be everywhere - every vote matters.
My investments and policies for my final two years reflect, support, and honor the communities who bore the brunt of the devastation this past year.
These are the very same communities that make Oregon the place that we all love.
I have been awe-struck by Oregonians who have run this marathon, stepping up at every turn to protect friends, families, and neighbors.
The undaunted and compassionate spirit of our state has truly shined.
I end this conversation full of hope, with the finish line in sight, and our eyes on the horizon.
We have been through a lot together this year.
And through it all, we have endured.
We have kept pace and lifted each other up, because we are determined to rise, rebuild, and reinvent a more just and equitable Oregon.
