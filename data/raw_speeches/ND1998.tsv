Lt. Governor Myrdal, First Lady Nancy Schafer, Supreme Court Justices, Tribal Leaders, distinguished legislators, special guests, and North Dakotans listening statewide on the radio or live on the Internet.
It is my great honor and pleasure to be here today to report on the state of our State.
Four years ago I began the tradition of presenting a State of the State speech every year, including those years in which there is no legislative session.
Today, I am using this occasion to urge North Dakotans to reflect on events of the past year, the lessons we learned, and how we might apply these lessons toward meeting the current and future challenges our state.
Last year, in presenting this speech, I talked about the patience, industry and enterprise of our ancestors who settled here more than 100 years ago.
I remarked about the incredible odds they battled, and marveled at their ability to carve out friendly, safe and thriving communities on these untamed prairies.
These pioneers were real North Dakota leaders.
Little did I envision one year ago how North Dakotans would be forced to draw upon that same patience, industry and enterprise to overcome nine life-threatening blizzards, a virtual statewide power outage, and the worst flood in our state’s history.
We all know the stories of these disasters well.
The suffering and loss that occurred in our state last year now seems almost unbelievable in retrospect.
Yet even more amazing to me is the incredible progress we have made to recover from these disasters and press on toward a better future.
For every story of loss, I know several stories of heroic individual sacrifice or personal investment North Dakota people made to help their community, their neighbors or even a perfect stranger.
Extensive state, federal and private disaster relief funds have greatly enhanced our state's ability to progress in the wake of these difficult challenges.
Again, I want to publicly express my thanks and appreciation to the taxpaying citizens of this state and great country for the incredible compassion they have shown North Dakota.
America came through for us.
As important as this financial support has been, it is not the secret to our success.
"As President Clinton said in his visit here, ""We have hardly ever seen such a remarkable demonstration of courage and commitment and cooperation and basic human strength, and we are very impressed and proud to be Americans when we see what you have done in the face of this terrible disaster."
I believe our progress, more than anything else, is the result of the tireless commitment thousands of individual North Dakotans are making to their communities and to this state each and every day.
That commitment to community captures the nature of leadership on a very basic level.
It proves, leadership is North Dakota’s future.
I have witnessed hundreds of these examples in North Dakota this past year.
I have been humbled, awestruck, and proud beyond words more times than I can count.
So, it only seemed appropriate for me to invite a few of our dedicated citizens here today to participate in this important annual event.
Thank you for joining me.
These seven people represent all of the unsung North Dakota heroes, North Dakota leaders, who are responsible for the good state of our State today.
And here’s why: Jim and Katie, will you please stand… A great many citizens contributed to the massive dike-building efforts up and down the Red River Valley this spring, filling and stacking an estimated eight million sandbags.
Residents of Drayton and Pembina constructed a wall virtually overnight to protect their cities.
But without the heartfelt efforts of our youngest citizens – thousands of elementary, high school and college students -- many communities including Fargo and Wahpeton would have been devastated by the flood.
Make no mistake about it, our students led the sandbagging brigades.
They were eager to help and displayed intense community spirit and activism.
Jim Azure and Katie Cook, student body presidents at the North Dakota State School of Science and Wahpeton High School, are here today on behalf of all the students in the Valley whose contributions meant so much.
Jim and Katie, you and your fellow students lead us all by your example.
Duane and Vivian, will you please stand… Devils Lake saw its fifth straight year of rising waters.
But the city's economy remains fairly stable due to North Dakotans like Duane Bye and Vivian Gwin.
Just last week, Dakota Aero Manufacturers announced plans for an airplane manufacturing facility in Devils Lake that will help diversify the local and state economy and create challenging, good-paying jobs for up to 100 people within five years.
Thank you Duane and Vivian and your partners for making this investment in the Devils Lake region and the state of North Dakota.
You lead us all by your example.
Roger Gussiaas, will you please stand… Extreme conditions in every season made 1997 an incredibly difficult and discouraging year for farmers and ranchers.
Yet, these brave business people continue to make bold investments in the future.
Dakota Growers Pasta has prospered beyond the most optimistic predictions.
United Spring Wheat Processors completed a successful equity drive.
And a group of visionary North Dakotans like Roger Gussiaas helped break ground on an $8 million oil seed processing plant in Carrington.
The plant will help shore-up a promising new crop and industry for our farmers.
Thank you for your important role in making this project a reality.
Roger, you and your co-op partners lead us all by your example.
Dave, will you please stand.
Every business in Grand Forks was forced to shut down indefinitely.
Some were destroyed by flood, others fire.
But thanks to the stubborn determination of people like Dave Badman, 92 percent of those business are up and running again.
Dave is a jewelry maker who sells his handmade Badman jewelry throughout the nation.
The flood brought 7 1/2 feet of water to the front of his Grand Forks store, destroying 95 percent of his tools, equipment and inventory.
Dave could have moved and started over anywhere, but he chose to reinvest in Grand Forks.
All summer, he commuted from Fargo and ran his business out of a UND classroom.
This spring he will reopen a 2,900 square foot shop employing six people in the heart of downtown.
Thank you for your loyalty to the Grand Forks economy, Dave.
You lead us all by your example.
Our final hero, 8-year-old Dustin Dishon, is down wounded today.
He’s sick at home and was unable to join us at the last minute.
But Dustin, I know you are listening to the speech at home, and I still want to recognize your efforts.
North Dakota is rated the number one place in the nation to raise children.
Crime is low, and people here are friendly, trusting and eager to help someone in need.
So, when Alaskan pilot Dennis Safranek crashed his seaplane into the Missouri River last October near Buford, 8-year-old Dustin Dishon didn’t think twice about what he should do.
He saw the plane land on the river just outside his home.
Then he saw it crash into a rock, nose dive into the water and sink.
Dustin quickly ran to the pilot’s aid.
He followed the struggling pilot downstream, reached out to him with a long stick and pulled him to shore.
If it wasn’t for Dustin, the pilot said he would not be alive today.
Brave, unselfish deeds like this help create the feeling of safety and comfort that people enjoy in communities throughout North Dakota.
Dustin, thank you for your courage.
You lead us all by your example.
To me, you are the North Dakota leaders who make our state a great place to call home.
These North Dakotans have all made significant personal sacrifices in order to make our state a better place to live.
Their leadership points the way to a better future.
Multiply these examples by thousands and you will see how, working together, we have been able to accomplish so much this year.
Just look what North Dakota has accomplished: We created 8,000 new jobs in our state last year.
We achieved the lowest statewide unemployment rate in the nation in two decades.
Welfare rolls dropped 23 percent.
We provided nearly $100 million in new dollars for higher education, K-12 education and care for our elderly.
We committed $60 million for disaster recovery.
And, we maintained the lowest crime rate in the nation.
One year ago, I said I was but one member of a team that stretches across the state.
Our team faced a formidable opponent last year, but I believe we came out on top.
The challenges have made one thing perfectly clear to me as Governor of this state, when North Dakotans work together toward a common goal there's no telling what we can accomplish.
The floods are gone.
The fires are out.
The blizzards of last year are but memories.
Yet today our state face new challenges, new storms if you will, and for the next few minutes I will talk about a few challenges that I believe are critically important to our state.
Like last year, each of these issues requires the same outpouring of citizen leadership and involvement: I will ask teachers, administrators and parents to embrace the reality of declining enrollments and create plans for ensuring education excellence for our children.
I will outline a plan to provide medical care to North Dakota children who lack it because they don’t have insurance.
I will charge tribal and state leaders to improve living conditions on North Dakota Indian reservations.
And most importantly, through it all, I will ask the North Dakota people, regardless of age, income level, profession, education or hometown, to step forward and lead our state into a more prosperous future.
Today, I challenge each and every North Dakota citizen to maintain that powerful community spirit that was so evident last spring along the endless sandbagging lines, soup kitchens and shelters.
Working together toward a common goal, we survived incredible disasters last year and managed to grow in spite of it.
I know that by channeling this same powerful energy, we can make North Dakota one thriving community filled with opportunities for success for everyone.
EDUCATION: Let's begin with education.
Our public education system has provided a foundation for success for many generations of North Dakotans.
This year again, our students shone above most of their peers, finishing at the top nationally in 8th grade math and science scores.
We suffer little of the problems of violence, drugs, student apathy or poor parent involvement that afflict many other schools in our nation.
I often boast to other governors that 86 percent our students live with two-parent families.
In North Dakota, we expect our kids to learn in school and get a job when they are done.
This administration has made education a priority, putting $190 million more into K-12 schools during our years in office.
This additional funding has helped maintain educational quality while slowing the rise in local property taxes.
Yet some problems are not immediately solved with more money or even hard work.
North Dakota schools face a different, serious challenge -- falling enrollments.
By the year 2010, our schools are expected to be teaching 17,000 fewer students than they do today.
That's a decrease of 14 percent statewide.
The decrease is a result of many factors: Baby boomers are aging.
Couples are having fewer children.
And the 50,000 people who left North Dakota in the 1980s continue to plague us.
Now, their children are noticeably absent in our schools.
Declining enrollments have serious implications for education in North Dakota.
Providing a broad, challenging high school curriculum in a school system for only a few students is just not feasible.
And it is certainly not affordable.
Rather than waiting for the inevitable to happen, we must start now to develop smart plans for addressing these changes.
Our top concern must be providing quality education to our children, not protecting school districts.
Several forward-thinking school systems in North Dakota are already leading the way.
Elgin/New Leipzig is one of them.
Three years ago, school administrators looked rationally at the enrollment numbers they faced.
By 2001, New Leipzig was projected to have only 73 students in grades K-12.
Elgin's figures were not much brighter at just 145.
Rather than digging in their heels, they chose to embrace change and develop a school system that works for both communities while increasing educational experiences for their children.
The administrators, the School Board, the teachers, the parents and students of Elgin and New Leipzig are all real North Dakota leaders.
They lead us all by their example.
They demonstrate that leadership is North Dakota’s future.
I'm pleased to say 30 government students from Elgin/New Leipzig High School are listening to this speech today.
And later this afternoon, they and other North Dakota students will be discussing it with me over the Internet.
This is just one small example of the expanded curriculum, better technology, shared services and improved extracurricular activities these students receive by working together.
Reorganization is not the only approach.
Other North Dakota schools are finding many ways to share resources.
Through the Western Network Interactive Television Program, 26 schools connected by information technology share teachers and after school events through interactive video.
Nine school districts in Barnes County get together regularly to develop collaborative programs such as school-to-work, distance learning, and a professional development academy.
These are services the small schools could not afford on their own.
The opportunities are endless.
But the alternatives to change are grim.
"As administrators in Elgin and New Leipzig told their communities, ""Failing to plan is planning to fail."
They decided they wanted to create their own future.
I could not agree more.
I want all North Dakota school districts to create their own future.
I want communities to design their own plan, just like Elgin and New Leipzig.
Today, I am announcing a joint project between my office and the Department of Public Instruction to help school districts address this critical issue.
First, we are calling on all local school boards, administrators, teachers, parents and students to develop a plan to address the changing demographics in their area.
The plan should include a district's population trends, the condition of school buildings and physical plant, and the financial resources expected in the future.
This information should be submitted by the end of 1998 for inclusion in the 1999 North Dakota School Report Cards.
"These plans will help us develop a ""Report Card for North Dakota's Future,"" an overall plan for the structure of our state's K-12 education system."
This plan will be completed in time for the 2001 Legislative Session and will include legislative or administrative proposals required to support the necessary changes in the system.
Our goal is to encourage all concerned citizens to face enrollment issues head on.
Your communities and regions will benefit from proactive planning.
But, more importantly, your children will benefit from the broader educational and extracurricular programs that can be afforded by working together.
With leadership, we need not fear the future.
CHILDREN’S HEALTH CARE: We work hard in North Dakota to give our children good schools, safe communities and loving families.
All of these are important for nurturing happy, well adjusted and motivated children.
But good health is perhaps the most basic requirement for learning in school and leading a productive adult life.
Four years ago, I appointed a Health Care Task Force to assess the quality and availability of health care for North Dakotans.
Among other things, the task force identified several thousand low-to-moderate income children who lack health insurance and therefore receive inadequate medical care.
These are children of working parents who cannot afford health insurance but don’t qualify for Medicaid.
Today, I’m announcing a program to help these children receive the basic medical care they need to give them a healthy start on life.
Beginning later this year, the state will provide a health insurance program including medical, dental and eye care for several thousand North Dakota children.
This program grew out of last year’s federal budget deal, and will require a matching share from North Dakota.
But we will avoid adding new levels of bureaucracy by using private insurance and focusing on the important area of preventive care.
We must address basic health problems in our children early on before they develop into life-long ailments.
Every dollar spent on preventive dental services saves at least three dollars, and every dollar spent on doctor visits for children saves seven dollars for the same treatment in an emergency room.
With this new Children’s Health Insurance program, we hope to give more North Dakota children the opportunity to grow up healthy and strong and become leaders in this great state.
TRIBAL CHALLENGES: Everyone has read news reports about the difficult life on North Dakota Indian Reservations.
High unemployment, poor housing, high rates of substance abuse, record high diabetes.
The problems fester and grow from the inside out, and are devastating to many people and communities.
We can not be satisfied with this.
North Dakota is praised for its high quality of life.
We must do all we can to see that it extends to all people and places in our state.
I believe it is time for North Dakota leaders to look at the structures of state and tribal governments, the interaction between these two levels of government and how this affects the well-being of citizens, particularly the Native American citizens of our state.
I have been carefully observing this situation for the past five years, and I have to admit most often I do not like what I see.
Far too often, the current structure creates or feeds on-going conflicts and confusion among our people.
Far too often, government structures obstruct the ability of Native American citizens to achieve a reasonable standard of living.
The governance of state and tribal laws is a confusion of complex and frustrating rules that only a few understand.
Whether it’s child support issues, law enforcement, taxation of residents and their purchases, or environmental regulations, jurisdiction needs a careful and thorough review for the good of all North Dakota citizens.
Examples are many… Take housing.
Many Native Americans in North Dakota do not have adequate housing and government shares in the blame.
Separate hunting and fishing regulations create conflicts among users and discourage broader use and enjoyment of these vast and relatively untapped recreation resources.
And, economic development on reservations is less than it should be in part because government structures discourage investment and capital formation.
The cultural heritage of all our citizens adds immeasurably to the richness of our lives in North Dakota and must be preserved.
We should strive to have governments in place that foster cultural growth and prosperity rather than hinder it.
To that end, I have asked tribal and state leaders to join with me on a new task force to find solutions to these sensitive issues so we might eliminate the barriers that hurt the well-being of an entire culture of our people.
This initiative will not produce more programming nor more money.
Instead, I foresee a careful examination of the complexities regarding state and tribal sovereignty, and how these actually affect the growth and development of Native American citizens.
Our nation and our world are becoming more integrated and interdependent.
Boundaries are becoming less not more distinct.
It is time for us to address these traditional boundaries in North Dakota and build more productive relationships between state, federal and tribal governments.
It is time for us to lead other states by our example, and advance a better quality of life for all Indian people.
LEADERSHIP: This leads me to my most critical topic today, leadership.
In some ways, it is the only topic of today.
It is the central theme to everything I have already discussed.
Effective leadership is essential for ensuring quality education amid declining enrollments, for improving health care for children, and for improving the quality of life on our state's Indian reservations.
We've seen some powerful examples of leadership in our state this past year, and I believe it represents just a fraction of the leadership talent that exists in North Dakota.
We saw leadership in disaster.
I traveled from snow-covered towns to flood-stricken cities.
Everywhere I went I met courageous local leaders, ordinary men and women who have accepted the challenge of public service.
These individuals sacrificed sleep, comfort and personal safety to protect the people they serve.
Looking back on 1997, I am proud of our system of government.
Local emergency managers and leaders did their jobs.
The state provided millions of dollars and countless hours of technical and physical support.
And the federal government came through with very generous emergency assistance.
By and large, the system worked.
I’d like to take a moment to recognize all the state and other public employees.
Congratulations.
Your actions speak louder than any words I could use to describe them.
You lead us all by your example.
While disaster recovery is ongoing, we must also take steps to prevent similar widespread damages in the future.
We are purchasing homes in flood-prone areas along the entire Red River Valley to keep people and property out of the most dangerous places.
We are completing a risk assessment of the Valley to pinpoint flood-related risks that might cause problems in future floods.
"We are ""disaster proofing"" registers of deeds offices to protect critical property and tax records."
And cities are re-examining floodplain regulations to ensure they are adequate.
This is just the beginning.
We are reviewing the entire state floodplain act and policies used by other states and local governments.
I will include recommendations for possible legislative changes in my presentation to the 1999 Legislature.
Our goal is to disaster proof North Dakota.
We cannot prevent wind, flood, fire, storm or drought, but we can make our state more resistant to the damaging effects of these unavoidable prairie forces.
We saw leadership in higher education… North Dakota’s University System is one of our strongest, most important assets.
Our colleges and universities educate, research, train, entertain and serve citizens of our state in countless ways.
The 1997 Legislature recognized the value of our University System with a $33 million increase in funding.
This spring, the UND, Mayville and Lake Region campuses underscored the valuable roles our higher education institutions serve that stretch far beyond the traditional duties of education and research.
They opened their doors and all their resources to the displaced Grand Forks community.
UND served as a starting point for recovery for hundreds of displaced people.
Without UND, rebuilding efforts would have been much delayed.
I commend the university’s administrators and employees for being so accommodating and filling so many urgent needs at a moment’s notice.
These colleges were leaders in flood recovery, and are good examples for all our state institutions.
Our higher education resources can and should be maximized for the greatest good to our entire state for education, research, entrepreneurial training, the arts, workforce training and economic development.
An independent report outlined recommendations to achieve this, and the Board of Higher Education incorporated many of these ideas into their 6-year plan for the University System.
I encourage the Board, Chancellor Isaak and all campus presidents to continue answering these urgent calls for stronger leadership, more strategic development and better accountability.
We also saw leadership in water development.
Another major accomplishment of 1997 occurred in the area of water development.
Devils Lake received long-awaited Congressional approval for an outlet.
And, for the first time since 1986, the state's environmental, agriculture, water, legislative and elected leaders agreed on a plan to complete the Garrison Diversion project once and for all.
It is a good, environmentally sound plan, a fair compromise that will secure a stable, high-quality water source for the entire state.
The Dakota Water Resources Act is one of the most critical pieces of federal legislation facing North Dakota today.
Designing a plan to complete this project could not have happened without the dedicated leadership of each local, state and federal representative involved.
And these leaders will be called upon once again to help win support for this bill in Congress.
We must see that our hard work pays off.
And we saw leadership in agriculture.
Extreme weather posed serious problems for North Dakota farmers and ranchers this year.
Blizzards, flooding, drought, and disease prevented many producers from taking advantage of the new opportunities of Freedom to Farm.
I am concerned about the problems facing farmers today.
There are the immediate challenges: a 33 percent decline in wheat production from last year, disease, livestock losses, both too much and too little rain.
But the most discouraging trend I see today is the general frustration farmers in all areas are feeling.
"It troubles me to hear them say, ""It’s just not fun any more,"" or ""What’s the point?"""
The solutions for agriculture are as complex as the dramatic changes occurring in the industry.
The Commission on the Future of Agriculture is beginning to identify and strategically plan for these changes, and I give my full support to this effort.
Ultimately, grassroots leadership and involvement is what will drive our agriculture industry and our rural communities through these challenges.
Some people have already stepped forward in a major way.
As a result, we have multi-million dollar facilities like ProGold, the North American Buffalo Co-op and many others that are invaluable additions to our agriculture economy and rural life.
And recently, the North Dakota Farmer’s Union announced plans to form a backgrounding feedlot cooperative in North Dakota for up to 30,000 head of cattle.
Other individuals are leading the way in agriculture more quietly, but the impact is no less significant.
Many operators are stepping out of their comfort zone to plant new crops, use new technology and implement other cutting-edge solutions to lower costs and improve the bottom line.
It is the most basic philosophy of business.
I will be focusing my efforts in the agriculture industry in two main areas this year.
Crop and disease research is critical for the industry now and in the future.
We must find more money to support the excellent research NDSU is conducting for new, disease resistant crops.
This year, I will be working closely with our research institutions and agencies to attract more research funds from Washington as well as private sources.
I am also going to push hard in Washington for improvements to crop insurance programs.
This is a risk management tool that was a key part of promises included in Freedom to Farm.
"Congress said, ""We’ll give you freedom to farm your own way and some tools to manage your risk."
North Dakota farmers made one thing clear this year.
We must sharpen those tools.
We are working hard to shore up the economic stability of rural communities, to improve risk management tools for farmers and ranchers, to focus more money on agriculture research, and to create more off-farm jobs and value-added processing centers to support rural families.
The Bank of North Dakota is announcing additional flexibility under farm loan programs to term out operating lines and refinance existing term debt.
We can and must find ways to help farmers, ranchers and the agriculture community realize more benefits from their work that produces high quality, affordable food for all of us.
Disaster recovery, water development, declining school enrollment, agriculture, economic development, tribal issues - these are just a few challenges facing our state that demand a consistent crop of well-trained leaders.
"At a recent ""Capital for a Day"" in Center, I asked the mayor about the demand for leaders in his community."
He said not only is it tough to recruit people, but hard to retain them.
Public service can be frustrating.
I don't know anyone involved who hasn't at some point wanted to throw up his arms and just give up.
This is why we must become more aggressive in identifying leaders, training them and involving them in our communities.
The state can't just go out, tap someone on the shoulder and proclaim.
"""From now on, you are a community leader."
Leadership development, like economic development, is a home-grown affair.
You find leaders first in the community.
They step forward in businesses, civic groups, church organizations, schools and local government.
And the state also has a valuable role to play.
We can provide training and technical support for your potential leaders.
Today, we begin a year-long effort to highlight the importance of leadership in our state.
I urge leaders and organizations at all levels to actively seek out potential leaders and ask them to consider their contributions to our future.
I have asked my Rural Development Council to spearhead a statewide project called Leadership North Dakota.
The project will incorporate three statewide forums organized by the North Dakota Leadership Systems Consortium aimed at rallying grassroots participation in the development of leaders.
In February, the first forum will take place over the statewide interactive video network and will focus on identifying national trends and local issues regarding leadership.
More than 600 current community and state leaders are already invited to participate in this event.
In June, the second forum will feature a six-hour appearance by world-renowned speaker Tom Peters.
He will inspire teams of new and seasoned leaders from throughout the state toward more active community involvement.
This year-long program will culminate in October, when I will host a Governor’s Leadership Development Conference to identify existing resources, training programs and gaps in services in the our state's leadership development network.
From these sessions we will produce a leadership program that is flexible and adaptable for organizations and communities statewide, yet provides a common core of skills and tools needed for success at any level.
A year from now, at the next State of the State, I will report back to you on our activities, and where we will go from there.
If all of us, working together, can foster a new generation of leaders, then our state will remain in good hands, indeed.
Those of you who follow my State of the State speeches know I traditionally take a late night walk around the Capitol grounds during my preparations for this speech.
Last night, on a splendidly cold, calm, North Dakota evening, I focused on our Heritage Center.
I envisioned the reflections of our past presented inside that building, replaying the incredible heritage our citizens point to for our strength.
"I remembered some words of Elwyn Robinson in his book, ""The History of North Dakota."
"He wrote: ""It is my conviction that an adequate knowledge of North Dakota’s past provides the best foundation for making decisions that will determine its future."
I then gazed upon the Capitol building itself.
This magnificent structure is a source of strength for us as well.
Built in the 1930s in the midst of the depression when things were crumbing all around us, this building rose to stand tall on the prairie.
It was a symbol of hope and prosperity.
A symbol of the future.
I thank the leaders of then who believed in the future of today.
In front of the Capitol last night, I looked at the two bare and silent flag poles, awaiting their time today to proudly fly the flags of North Dakota and the United States of America -- symbols of freedom, peace and safety.
I was struck by the words of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.
In his inaugural address in 1981, he outlined the challenges we, as a nation, were facing.
"He said our challenges ""…will require our best efforts and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together, with God’s help, we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us."
There is one more encouraging sign that arose from the crisis’s we faced last year.
Polls showed that people’s faith in God increased during these tragic times.
And, as we turn to God again today and ask for his supreme guidance for all the leaders of our great state, I know we will overcome the challenges.
I’m confident that, working together, hand in hand, we will face the issues I’ve outlined today and come out on top.
We will grab hold of our strengths and we will create a better future for North Dakota.
And we have every reason to believe that.
Afterall, we are North Dakotans!
Thank you and God bless you.
