Madame Speaker, Mr. President, honorable members of the Governor's Council and the House and Senate, my fellow citizens of New Hampshire: One year ago, I stood before you for the first time as Governor, as New Hampshire's first woman Governor, sharing the podium with New Hampshire's first woman Speaker.
Madame Speaker, we have accomplished a lot working together.
One year ago, I pledged to you in this historic chamber and to everyone in our great state that I would bring people together to solve the problems we face.
I urged you to join me to focus on what's important to our families and our future; to put aside partisanship and instead choose leadership in tending to the people's business.
One year later, we have much progress to report and a new challenge to meet.
The Supreme Court of our state has issued a challenge that will test our commitment to our children and their education; a challenge that will test our values and define our future; a challenge that can either tear us apart or bring us together.
Once again, it's time for leadership, not partisanship.
It's time to focus on what's important to our families and our future.
It's time to come together to address all the challenges we face.
Over the past year, we've come together in triumph, and we've come together in tragedy.
When a madman struck in Colebrook, and a young police officer was killed in Epsom, we came together and honored the fallen, we shared the grief of their families, we rallied around the community.
Dealing with those tragedies taught me one important lesson: That all the differences we have about politics and ideology are insignificant in the face of our duty to each other as citizens of this great state.
We know what we can accomplish when we work together.
We've done a lot in one year.
And New Hampshire is prospering.
Today, I'm very happy to report that the state of our state is excellent.
By almost any measure, we're leading New England and the rest of the nation.
We had the second lowest crime rate in the nation.
We ranked fourth overall in the health of our people.
Unemployment at its lowest rate since 1988.
842 new businesses opened in the past six months.
16,000 new jobs in the past year.
Wages up almost seven percent.
The number of people without health insurance down one third.
Over the past year, we've worked hard to keep New Hampshire growing.
We speeded up improvements to state roads and bridges.
We made smart investments to increase New Hampshire tourism, promote New Hampshire products and expand international trade.
The first governor-led trade mission outside of North America has created exciting new opportunities for our businesses.
We made changes to make government work better for less.
We called in experts to make real estimates of state revenues to ensure honest, responsible budgets.
We reformed the way we put the state employees health benefits out to bid, and because of that we'll save almost $10 million dollars this year alone.
We sent more money back to cities and towns to help provide property tax relief -- $98 million dollars more than in the previous biennium.
I said we would make education a priority, and we did.
We increased support for schools by 40 percent.
Our kindergarten initiative is working.
This fall, more school districts established public kindergarten than in any single year in New Hampshire history.
And over two dozen districts are looking at kindergarten for next year.
We've made a difference for students at all levels: a reading recovery initiative to make sure every child learns to read; full funding of catastrophic aid; help for schools to use assessment tests to improve student performance; a tax-free tuition savings plan for college; and almost 2 million additional dollars for our schools through the Goals 2000 program.
We did all that while we were cutting the budget deficit from more than $44 million dollars to just over 1 million.
And we did all that without any new broad-based taxes.
If we stay on track, the deficit will be gone altogether in two years and replaced by a surplus.
We need to address the Claremont decision, but we can't let that or anything else pull us off the course we've set toward a balanced budget.
We've shown that we can put education first, make smart investments in our future, and be fiscally responsible.
So now let us turn together to face the future.
As important as the Claremont decision is, we must not lose sight of the many other challenges and opportunities ahead of us.
We've set a course of steadily improving our schools, and we should be proud of what we've accomplished.
But we can do better.
Because our ultimate goal is to have schools that are not merely adequate, but that are world class -- schools that will enable us to have the best prepared work force possible.
That's why I'll soon be announcing a Best Schools initiative to make New Hampshire an example for the nation of how to teach our children and prepare our people for the 21st century.
We're also going to work to help our children stay healthy.
Today, 20,000 New Hampshire children have no health insurance - no protection if they get sick or injured.
We have the opportunity to begin to expand health coverage for children.
And, we should do it this year.
We need an economic strategy to help ensure that New Hampshire continues to prosper and seizes the opportunities of the 21st Century.
We have filed an application with the U. S. Department of Commerce for a grant that will help provide funding for us to develop that strategy.
We expect to hear later this month that we have been successful.
We'll also keep fighting to bring down the cost of electricity.
I will keep pushing this issue in every forum possible until every family and every business in New Hampshire has lower electric bills.
I will fight for as long as it takes, but I believe a settlement that lowers electric rates and brings competition to the electric industry is in the best interests of New Hampshire.
And today, I say to the management of Public Service Company and Northeast Utilities, you should recognize that it is in the best interests of your stockholders as well.
Recognize that the pursuit of short-term profits at the expense of your New Hampshire customers is simply bad business.
New Hampshire ratepayers have more than shared the burden of bringing PSNH out of bankruptcy.
They have borne it on their backs.
Now is the time for your stockholders to share the burden.
You can win back the good will once associated with the name Public Service Company of New Hampshire.
Competition is coming.
Embrace it, and work with us to lower electric rates.
I'm going to work not just for our economic security but for our personal security, too.
We know that we're not immune to violence, and when it occurs, it must be punished.
Together with the Deputy Speaker and the Attorney General, we have crafted legislation that will strengthen our death penalty laws.
Views on the death penalty are deeply held, and I respect the right of each of you to vote your conscience on this issue.
But I believe that there are murders so heinous that the ultimate penalty is warranted, and I believe our law should cover them.
Next week, I will be introducing a new Corrections Commissioner who will take a fresh look at our prison system.
We must build a new prison now to relieve overcrowding and enhance public safety, and we must resolve the issue of the Lakes Region Facility once and for all.
These are all important issues facing our state.
But the greatest challenge facing us comes from the Supreme Court's decision in the Claremont lawsuit.
It is a challenge that will test all of us -- our dedication to our children's education and their economic future; our steadfastness in meeting the court's timetable without being rushed to hasty decisions; and our creativity in finding a solution that preserves what is best about New Hampshire yet recognizes what must to be changed.
Most of all, it will test once again our ability to work together for the greater good of New Hampshire.
Let's start by being honest about this challenge.
The full ramifications of the court's decision are far-reaching and filled with complexities.
I've learned in my life to beware of those who rush forward with instant answers or simple solutions.
They may make headlines, but they rarely make progress or solve serious problems.
I am confident that we will find a solution -- if we work together, and if we let ourselves be guided by common sense and dedication to our children's future.
The Supreme Court ruled that education is a fundamental right.
That ruling did not tell us anything that we didn't already know in our hearts as parents.
That's what this issue should be about -- our children and their education.
About every parent who looks at their children with hope.
About providing opportunity for every child while respecting the pocketbook of every parent.
We are not the first state to face this kind of decision.
Eighteen other states have been in the same position.
We need to learn from their mistakes and profit from their successes.
While facing a court order is not unique, we must find a solution that is uniquely New Hampshire.
As we work to find the answer, I will follow three fundamental guidelines.
First, I will oppose any new broad-based tax.
Our citizens don't want one, and I don't believe the court ruling requires one.
Second, I believe that local control is one of the great strengths of our educational system.
Anything we do must preserve the right of local communities to control our schools.
Third, our solution must ensure the quality of our children's education.
We must find a way to lift up those schools that need help without dragging the others down.
We must accept this responsibility to our children, not avoid it by rewriting our constitution.
This issue is not, as some have suggested, a simple choice between passing new broad-based taxes or rewriting our constitution.
And it is not a simple choice between local control and a state takeover of our schools.
We've heard those voices before.
Only a year ago, those same voices said that we could not expand kindergarten without broad-based taxes or a state takeover.
Those same voices also said that accepting Goals 2000 funds to help local schools would take away local control.
But together, we proved those voices wrong.
Over the past year, we've shown that the old choices -- between doing nothing and overturning New Hampshire values and traditions -- are not really the only choices.
Let us prove them wrong again.
We can preserve what is best about New Hampshire, and still move forward to change what needs to be changed.
We can, and we must.
One year ago, I stood before you and said that the people do not look to us for partisanship; they look to us for leadership.
They do not judge us by our party, by our ideology or by our gender, but by the quality of our work -- the quiet, steady work of people striving together to make tomorrow a little better than today.
The work ahead of us will not be easy.
It will be hard.
But I have faith in the people of New Hampshire and this legislature.
I know the good this legislature is capable of accomplishing.
I have seen it firsthand, as a proud member of the state senate for six years and as your governor for the last 12 months.
I have every confidence that we can rise to meet the challenge before us.
Let us be guided by our hope that future generations will look back and express thanks for the work we did in this session.
Thank you.
