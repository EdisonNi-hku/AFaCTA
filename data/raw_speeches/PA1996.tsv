Thank you.
And good morning.
One month ago today, late at night after most of us had gone to bed, heavy snows began to fall across our Commonwealth.
With the dawn, the storm intensified and would not relent.
By the time the sun had set again on Pennsylvania, much of the state was covered with 30 inches of snow.
It was the Storm of the Century.
And it had only just begun.
Next were heavy winds, bitter cold and drifting.
Five days later, another foot of snow.
Seven days after that, the mercury hit 56 degrees.
As quickly as it arrived, the snows began to melt.
And then, the Almighty handed Pennsylvania the ultimate test -- heavy rains.
The destructive floods came fast and strong.
More than 200,000 Pennsylvanians were forced to flee their homes.
Over 52,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.
From that first snowfall to the receding waters, our communities and our citizens suffered losses totaling at least $1 billion.
One hundred Pennsylvanians lost their lives.
It is only right that we begin today with a moment of silence for those victims, a moment of prayer, each of us in our own way.
******************** We should also pause for a moment today to recognize those who kept the toll from rising.
Three of these heroic Pennsylvanians are with us.
"Winston Churchill once said that ""courage is the quality which guarantees all others."
My words can't capture the courage of these Pennsylvanians.
Equipped with only a jet-ski and their courage, Eric Malone and Mike Bowmaster saved five people from the raging, icy Juniata River.
Braving frigid waters and deadly currents, Eric and Mike pulled four people from the water after flooding overcame a mobile home.
Soon after, they pulled from the water a teenage girl who held onto a bush, clinging for her life.
And then there was Sgt.
Arthur Goodling who represents the best of the Pennsylvania National Guard.
Buffeted by high winds, snow squalls and using night vision goggles, the Guardsmen of Company G lowered their Chinook helicopter in and out of tight quarters for twenty-four hours.
They rescued 65 people from roof tops, cars and fence posts.
At one point, Sgt.
Goodling himself plunged into rushing waters in an attempt to rescue a fellow Pennsylvanian.
Gentleman, today you represent thousands of Pennsylvanians whose names we may never know, but whose courage and compassion we will never forget.
On behalf of all Pennsylvanians, thank you.
Shortly, the General Assembly will reconvene in this chamber, to open a special session on this natural disaster.
Pennsylvanians helped one another survive the blizzard and the floods.
As their elected representatives, we will join together to help them rebuild.
It is our desire.
It is our duty.
Working together, it will be done.
******************** But today, we gather for a different task.
As we recover from the past we still must look to the future.
We must continue our work to make Pennsylvania a competitor and leader in the global economy.
We must continue our work to provide better schools, safer streets and family-sustaining jobs.
And we must continue our work to make Harrisburg a lean model of customer-driven government.
I submit to you a budget for Pennsylvania's future.
This is a budget for the 21st century.
It emphasizes people, not government.
It invests in technology; not bureaucracy.
It makes hard choices, not automatic handouts.
It demands accountability, not just from those that government serves, but from government itself.
We can no longer look to Washington for more.
We will receive less.
This budget assumes that Washington will send Pennsylvania nearly $600 million in cuts.
It assumes state revenue growth will be slow.
This budget is for our future.
We will not respond like budgets of the past.
Too often, state government met such challenges with increased taxes and increased spending.
Too often, state government dug into the pockets of taxpayers when they could least afford it.
My budget does the exact opposite.
For the first time in 25 years, state government will spend less than the year before.
We cut general fund spending by $30 million.
We redirect another $787 million to better reflect the priorities of Pennsylvania.
And we cut taxes -- $60 million worth.
Every cent, aimed at job creation and retention.
Every cent -- aimed at the job market of the 21st century.
******************** Last year, we cut taxes by $286 million.
We did it to send a signal that Pennsylvania is now job-friendly.
We did it so everyone will know we are more committed than ever to retaining the jobs we have and creating new ones.
Already, we have seen results.
This past year, Pennsylvania kept and created nearly 30,000 jobs.
This budget contains a tax cut to continue that trend.
First, something new for Pennsylvania-- a Job Creation Tax Credit.
Employers will now be eligible for a tax credit of up to $1,000 for every new, family-sustaining job they create.
It is a $30 million annual tax cut with a guarantee.
Taxpayers won't spend a cent unless there are new jobs to show for it.
Second, I propose a $24 million reduction in the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.
And third, I call for the elimination of the 1991 sales tax on computer services in several sectors of our economy.
Just listen to what Harrisburg did.
A high-value, good-paying future oriented sector of our economy was beginning to take off.
So what did Harrisburg do?
It taxed it.
That just doesn't make sense.
These are precisely the jobs we want for Pennsylvanians.
Tax cuts are an important part of our economic development strategy.
But they are just that -- a part.
Today's intense competition requires more.
In support of Pennsylvania's workers, we have done more.
This budget nearly doubles our investment in customized job-training -- $7.5 million more.
It's a proven program.
We also create regional skills centers that operate as virtual supermarkets for training and education resources.
And we establish Individual Learning Accounts to give employers and employees the opportunity to invest together in themselves.
But, there is another kind of investment Pennsylvania must make to retain and create jobs.
This investment bears no cost to taxpayers.
It requires only an investment of our will.
We must reform workers' compensation.
Here are the facts.
We recently compared ourselves to six of our competitor states.
In 40 out of 42 categories, Pennsylvania has the highest workers' comp rates.
In most categories, we are not even close.
This is one competition where we can't afford to be number one.
I recently received a letter from a bottling company executive in Philadelphia.
"Here is what he wrote - ""It has become increasingly difficult for business to remain competitive and profitable in Pennsylvania due to our workers' compensation statute and classification structure."
As a company doing business in three states, we face a difficult choice: stay in Pennsylvania or move our distribution to a neighboring state and benefit from potentially large cost reduction.
If they move their 700 jobs to New Jersey or to Delaware, that company could save three to four million dollars a year in workers' comp rates.
Three to four million dollars a year.
For the time being, those jobs are still here.
"But, as the executive warns in his letter, ""Further delays in meaningful reform will only increase the exodus of industry from our state, and after 93 years in Pennsylvania, we would hate to be joining this flight."
But the flight is already underway.
Just ask 200 men and women who are unemployed in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Ask them, if they would have liked to work for TRACO on Pittsburgh's North Side.
TRACO could have expanded right next to their existing facility, but instead took its 200 new jobs to Iowa.
Why?
A major factor --workers' comp.
Ask the 50 employees who could have been employed by Turner Steel.
That employer, in Hermitage, expanded in Ohio.
Why?
Because of workers' comp.
How long will we wave good-by to our jobs?
When will we act to save them?
I say, the time to act is now.
Pennsylvania's workers perform difficult, demanding jobs.
And on the job, some do get hurt.
When that happens, it is only right that while they recover, we provide them quality health care and financial support.
That basic principal will not be compromised by meaningful, fair and equitable reform.
But we can no longer pretend that our workers' compensation system is helping our workers.
Tragically, ironically, the system we designed to help injured workers is costing healthy workers their jobs.
No economic development strategy will be complete without real workers' compensation reform.
This is not about labor versus management.
This is not about special interests.
This is about Pennsylvania jobs.
We must also design new economic development tools.
This past year, I personally worked with many of you to attract good job-creators like Sony and Pfizer; Bush Industries and Berg Electronics; Lockheed Martin and Harris Semi-Conductor.
Pennsylvania was fortunate to enjoy these and other successes.
But the competition among states is fierce.
We discovered that our economic development tools, although sharp and to-the-point fifteen years ago, have lost their cutting edge.
I propose a consolidation of our economic development programs so that we can deliver the right kind of services, the right kind of capital, at just the right moment.
Pennsylvania also needs to offer one-stop-shopping to all potential employers.
Through a business resource center, modern technology will connect prospective employers with every community in our state.
And Team Pennsylvania will work with existing employers to resolve problems before they take our jobs elsewhere.
This budget also reaffirms our willingness to compete and win in global markets.
We will expand our presence in Asia and Latin America, and target new markets for products -- including our number one industry -- agriculture.
And we will attract the dollars of foreign and domestic visitors with an aggressive new campaign for tourism.
******************** But when it comes to creating jobs -- jobs for the future -- there is nothing more important than education.
The link between economic development and education is irrefutable.
A Pennsylvania high school diploma should send a clear message to employers.
It should mean that its recipient is ready to meet the high standards that are expected of 21st century workers in any plant, any office, anywhere.
Otherwise, no tax cut, no regulatory reform, no new program will help secure Pennsylvania's economic resurgence.
If today's students are to be tomorrow's workers they need a first hand foundation in technology.
"I propose project ""Link to Learn"" for Pennsylvania's children -- a three year initiative."
$121 million for the 21st Century.
It will bring Pennsylvania's children together and put our classrooms on-line.
Erin O'Brien is a 5th grader at Grace Park Elementary School in Delaware County.
The other day, she e-mailed me about the role she hopes technology could play in her education.
"She wrote -- ""We could be on the Internet and reach out to places that we aren't in right now."
We could see things that otherwise would be impossible to bring into our classroom.
I want Erin and her fellow students to see the impossible.
Our goal is to make computers as commonplace as the chalkboard.
This community partnership begins with a $40.3 million payment this year.
We will help buy computers for local school districts -- targeted at the schools that need them most.
Just as important, we will link those computers with other classrooms, with our communities and with our institutions of higher education.
Think about it -- virtual libraries -- virtual classrooms -- and teachers trained to use them.
Coupled with an expansion of the distance learning network, soon Pennsylvania's children will be able to talk, interact and learn from each other.
In fact, tomorrow I will have the chance to use this new technology.
From our Capital, I'll be linked to students in Philadelphia, Erie and Indiana.
Together we will explore the information superhighway and demonstrate that in the age of cyberspace, classrooms shouldn't just be preparing for the 21st century -- they should be living in it.
We reach out to Pennsylvania's children in other ways as well.
Three- to five-year-olds receive more help with a $2 million increase in Early Intervention.
We will create a better atmosphere for learning with an increase for Safe Schools and Alternative Schools.
And we bolster Pennsylvania's support of lifetime learning with an additional $1 million for public libraries.
Last year, Pennsylvania's school districts received their largest funding increase in basic-education in four years.
This budget sustains that record funding level.
But it will not increase.
Yet, we can still provide millions and millions of dollars to our school districts without asking taxpayers to pay more.
I challenge the General Assembly to send me the broadest possible mandate relief package for our local school boards.
That way, we can relieve the tax pressure on older Pennsylvanians and property owners.
Spending previously dictated by Harrisburg will be directed by teachers, schools and parents.
The Pennsylvania School Boards Association estimates that the elimination of one mandate alone -- mandatory sabbaticals -- could save $225 million.
That's the equivalent of you voting for a 6.7% increase for basic education.
Send it to my desk.
It's a bill I'll be proud to sign.
For me, one of the most difficult decisions in the budget was to not include the line item for educational opportunity grants.
It's no secret how I feel; giving parents and children choices must be one of our highest educational goals.
I will continue to make my case to Pennsylvanians.
I am confident that their support of this reform will soon be reflected in this chamber.
In other words, I'll be back.
******************** Last year we began another very important debate in Harrisburg.
It was a debate about the relationship between government and those it serves.
It is, in part, a debate about welfare.
We must continue that debate now.
Pennsylvania is a compassionate and generous state.
We care about one another.
And for years, we have spent billions to eradicate poverty and help the most vulnerable.
Right now, thirty-three cents of every dollar Pennsylvanians send to Harrisburg is spent by the Department of Public Welfare.
Despite our good intentions -- despite the unprecedented sums of money -- government has failed to break the cycle of dependency.
We failed, because along the way we separated welfare from our traditions and our common sense.
I call upon this legislature to pass welfare reform that embodies Pennsylvania's traditions: its work ethic; its commitment to family; and the importance we place on education.
It's just common sense.
Common sense -- those who receive benefits from the state should be held accountable.
So we will require an agreement of mutual responsibility -- an agreement of mutual responsibility between welfare recipients and the working Pennsylvanians who pay for their support.
Common sense -- working welfare recipients should not be penalized for saving their money.
So we won't.
Common sense -- teenage parents on welfare will always be on welfare without a diploma.
So we will insist that they get one.
Common sense -- it is difficult for welfare parents to go to work or school if they can't afford day care for their kids.
So we will make an unprecedented investment in child care -- $52 million more.
Common sense -- self-sufficiency means work.
So we will require work by the end of two years and we provide 66% increase for job-training to help people obtain it.
Our objective is not just to save taxpayers' money.
Our objective is to save people.
If we do the job right, we will do both.
We can no longer wait for Washington.
I ask that the General Assembly begin work now on this reform.
Together, I know we can get the job done.
Pennsylvanians are committed to helping the most vulnerable among us, but they also want safe neighborhoods, quality schools and good roads.
If we are to support the priorities of Pennsylvanians --- this year and in years to come -- we must get medical assistance spending under control.
Over the last ten years, the cost of medical assistance has soared 134% -- double the rate of our state budget.
Those costs are staggering.
We can no longer afford such broad coverage.
This budget tightens the eligibility for medical assistance benefits to able-bodied adults without dependent children.
It directs much of the savings to programs that promote self-sufficiency -- job training, drug and alcohol treatment and special mental health services.
In addition, we accelerate our efforts to improve the management of this monstrous program.
Today we begin implementing the dramatically improved Health Choices program -- a managed-care program for Medicaid recipients in southeastern Pennsylvania.
We must explore any means to stretch these dollars as far as we can.
And we continue our special efforts for children.
I propose we redirect another penny of the existing state Cigarette tax to the Childrens Health Insurance Partnership, or CHIP.
This program, provides health insurance to children of the working poor.
Total costs soon will outstrip its dedicated revenue.
This is an important program.
We will find the savings to sustain it.
For example, the savings generated by the simple merger of the Departments of Community Affairs and Commerce into the Department of Economic and Community Development will free up resources to support the children in CHIP.
We also looked for ways to improve services for older Pennsylvanians.
I propose a $20 million expansion of the PACE program, so another 26,000 older Pennsylvanians can get help in obtaining prescription drugs.
We give assistance to 1,100 more seniors so they can stay in the homes and communities they hold dear, rather than nursing homes.
And to honor the sacred contract between government and our veterans, we will open a new nursing-home facility in southwestern Pennsylvania.
******************** A year ago, I stood before you to open the special session on crime.
Thanks to your bipartisan work, it was an unprecedented success.
We enacted 37 laws, each of them designed to make Pennsylvanians safer.
We elevated victims rights.
We sent an unmistakable signal to violent juveniles that the rules had changed.
They are now held accountable for their actions.
We took bold steps to modernize our rape laws; to protect communities against those who assault our children; to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.
And we made the death penalty a reality, not an idle threat.
Now, we continue our work to make every community safer.
This budget includes $62.2 million for the continued expansion of our prison system.
Some in the Capitol will criticize this expenditure.
Most Pennsylvanians will not.
Those who murder, assault and rape our neighbors must be put away.
We expand our efforts to prevent crime.
This budget funds new grants for counties to expand drug and alcohol programs.
We offer juveniles a chance -- a chance to turn their lives around before they become violent.
We fund expanded drug and alcohol treatment in our prisons and provide new community grants for crime-prevention strategies.
We also continue to increase our support for the probation and parole system.
Greater vigilance, greater oversight and hopefully fewer incidents of repeat crime.
******************** Pennsylvanians, your state government will continue to do more with less.
"There is a sign hanging in my budget secretary's office -- ""Nothing stimulates the imagination like a budget cut."
It's true.
Who said government should get bigger just because it is a year older?
We should strive to be leaner, more responsive and more friendly to you -- our customer -- the taxpayer.
We have already begun this work in earnest.
Last year I led the way, cutting the governor's office budget by 10 percent.
This year, I cut my budget again.
We eliminated the Department of Environmental Resources.
Now, it's a leaner Department of Environmental Protection.
It's mission: to cooperate with Pennsylvanians in the joint venture of environmental preservation.
With the newly established, money-back guarantee program, we put our money where our mouth is.
In so doing, we introduced government to a novel concept -- timely answers -- timely responses -- to its citizens.
We made it easier to do business with the state.
We simplified tax forms.
And we increased electronic access to information with the Pennsylvania Internet Home Page.
But there is more, much more, to be done.
Too often, PennDOT has greeted taxpayers with a complicated form, a long line or a busy signal.
That will change.
We will put our customers first with Saturday hours, easier vehicle registration, and drivers' license testing in our schools.
At the Department of State, we begin the process of computerizing campaign finance records.
Candidates will be able to submit their reports on disk.
And those disks will be made available to the public.
And finally, this morning I signed an executive order that calls for a state-wide regulatory review among all departments.
We want to make sure that regulations are in plain language, easily understood, and don't cause more harm than good.
******************** When the blizzard and flood struck, state government responded with teamwork, cooperation and timeliness.
"No one said, ""I don't do windows."
Everybody did them.
PennDOT and Department of General Services workers joined National Guardsmen.
They worked around the clock to clear snow-covered roads.
Our park system and state universities loaned heavy equipment and machinery.
The Department of Banking worked with private industry to provide special low-interest loans to aide disaster victims.
The Blizzard Brigade was out in full force.
A job needed to be done -- and it got done.
State government did something it should do all the time.
It pulled together to pull Pennsylvania through.
Its response was creative and decisive.
And Pennsylvania is stronger for it.
Now we must apply that same creative energy and decisive action to the task that will outlive this generation -- uniting Pennsylvania with the 21st century.
This budget is for the 21st century.
We merge the traditions of our past with new directions for our future.
We take another step to fulfill the great promise and potential our Commonwealth holds.
We say to Pennsylvania's children, we dared to do more.
Not just for us, but for them.
Thank you.
Godspeed and God bless.
