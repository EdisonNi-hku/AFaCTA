SENTENCES
"wants to hire, that's real competition."
"So we've got these forces that are creating competitive forces, which don't allow us to have business as usual."
"And then online offerings, virtual classrooms, enabling students to learn anywhere, anytime from almost any device,that's changing,and in North Dakotait’salso exploding."
"We've gone from 10,000 students in higher education to 16,000 that are taking at least one class online."
But that's a fraction of the two and a half million that are doing it nationwide.
And that's the fastest growing category of learning.
So we've got to be in a position to be able to respond to that demand.
And there are a number of things that are happening.
The Dakota College atBottineau became the first college in theU.
S. to offer college credentials for dual credit high school students through a program called LEAP.Fantastic.
"BSE, Bismarck State becoming a polytechnic organization to meet the demands for real two-year technical and transfer programs while adding four-year degrees in technical fields."
"Dickinson State,on their path to become a dual mission institution."
"This past summer alone, they got ramped up and they trained and certified 18 CNAs to join the workforce."
So big opportunities for us to evolve and transform these organizations.
Will we meet our workforce needs?
"Again, 30,000 jobs open in North Dakota,and the university system is key to solving the workforce shortage."
"And in fact, our system of statewide institutions is jumping into the certificate."
Over 100 certificate programs have been created in the last two years alone.
Wilson State College launched the One Basin-One Way!Program last year.
"They've already provided safety training to over 4,000 workers in the energy industry."
Probably saving lives through their work.
Lake Region State College in Devils Lake is approved to provide apprenticeships inIT areas.
This has led to an agreement with Northrop Grumman for electronics based apprenticeships.
"North Dakota State College of Science has taken advantage of the newly created North Dakota Career Builder Scholarship and loan repayment program where they've been able to distribute $76,000 to 17 students that are seeking careers that are in high demand."
"And Minot State, Valley City State, Mayville State continue to deliver critical regional training for teachers, nurses, and many other sectors of the workforce.So we've got a great base."
"We've got to do more,and we have to do it quickly because the competition is not theoretical, it's real and it's here right now."
"Of course, we know that as we talked about before, in a world driven by innovation, research is essential."
And we've got some great examples goingacross our major research institutions.
"NDSUcontinues to lead in coatings and polymers, materials and precision agriculture."
Last year the Department of Defense awarded NDSU $1 million grant to study high-performance earth-friendly polymers for manufacturing.
"NDSU got another five-year, $4.3 million grant for precision agriculture to help farmers, including using UAS for crop and weed management."
"UND of course,right here,leading research in a number of areas that I've talked about already, but whether healthcareorenergy, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded UND a $7.6 million grant for research to increase mental health services and combat drug abuse throughout the state."
"And then history was made last week, and I see thatDr."
"Warneis here, who leads the Indians Into Medicine Program, but the State Board of Higher Education approved the first doctoral program in indigenous health right here at UND.Congratulations, Dr. Warne."
So we can have the greatest higher education system in the world.
"We've got the resources to do it, but we've got to have a mindset,a growth mindset about innovating and reinventing and going into each discussion in that way on what we can do differently and what we can do better and how we can meet the competitive needs of today's fast-moving marketplace."
Behavioral health and addiction.
"This past year, we focused more than ever on improving access to behavioral health and reinventing recovery."
"More than 22 million people in the United States struggle with the disease of addiction, and it is a disease."
"It's a brain disease,and it's chronic and it's progressive and if not treated, it's ultimately fatal.It destroys lives."
"It destroys families, destroys futures.And it doesn't discriminate."
It touches every social and economic group in America.
"We've heard the call from stakeholders, whether those are teachers in the classroom or whether it's parents or community leaders to improve the state's behavioral health system with additional investment in treatment and prevention and recovery."
And we've taken that charge and we've created a statewide movement called Recovery Reinvented.
"And I want to say at this point, I want to give a shout out to the First Lady because none of this movement would be happening without her amazing leadership and with her incredible courage."
"Sharing her own lived experience, having the courage to share that she also is in recovery and out there as a face and voice of recovery, leading the fight against the shame and stigma of the disease of addiction."
"Her work is transforming lives, and it's saving lives and reminding all of us that there always is hope and recovery."
"Next month, the First Lady will celebrate,one day at a time, 18 years of recovery."
Please join me in congratulating our amazing First Lady.
"The Recovery Reinvented summit this year, it's grown –600, 800, 1,200 people this year."
This was a livestreamed across the state.
"First event ever that's been livestreamedinto all of our correctional institutions,and we saw how those efforts are making a difference, whether it's through workforce recovery issues, studentled efforts supported through the Youth Ending Stigma challenge, the YESChallenge,or the new Family Strong program which has (been) made available for free to support families who are impacted by someone in their family having a substance use disorder."
"We've also got a fantastic and amazing team inside of Human Services which is led by Chris Jones, the behavioral health team led by Pam Sagness.They've been amazing."
They're doing amazing work and they've been an amazing partner with Recovery Reinvented.
The work that they've done this last year to launch programs included launching a 24-hour peer support hotline as a resource for individuals that are struggling with addiction.
"If you call,you get someone who's been there.They've been in your shoes.Maybe they've been to prison.They've been through recovery.They've been through relapse."
Call and talk to somebody who's walking the challenging path that you're on.
It's bringing effective results and bringing hope to those struggling with addiction by sharing their lived experiences.
"We held the first-ever peer support day in the Capitol last year in 2019, and we've expanded our reimbursement for peer support specialists."
"In a rural state we don't have enough medical providers, but the data shows that if you could talk to somebody who has the lived experience, it's as effective as ."
part of initiating your recovery is talking to someone who's professionally trained but maybe has never gone through the struggle with the disease of addiction.
We have an incredible program called Free Through Recovery.
"This is a partnership between Human Services and North Dakota Department of Corrections for access to recovery support services for those with serious behavioral health concerns, but who also became entangled as often happens with the criminal justice system."
"And again with the support of the legislature, the judicial branch and other stakeholders, we dedicated an additional $7 million this last year to expand the Free Through Recovery to help take this proven approach and bring it to juveniles, and another $4million to expand it to diversion programs, not just people coming out of corrections, but to keep people from going in."
"Since the program launched just in 2018 more than 2,500 citizens in North Dakota have been referred to participate in Free Through Recovery and receive services frommore than 50 agencies offering care coordination peer support."
"In the first 18 months of that program, more than 60% of the participants met three of the four desired outcomes."
The desired outcomes include like getting a job and getting a place to live and getting your driver's license.
"This is a pay for performance program that helps people with the social determinants of health, that help them get on a track that keeps them out of the correction system."
It's unique in America and it's working and it's working because we've got amazing people that are working as peersupport specialists.
"It takes a real commitment to make Free Through Recovery successful and we're honored to have with us today, Deborah Camperud."
"She's been in recovery herself for 19 years and like so many who've struggled with the disease of addiction, it was part of her family history.She was married with children."
She used alcohol and meth for many years.
And in recovery she's been passionate about helping women and children and ending the cycle of addiction.
"She started a non-profit called Daughters of Reconciliation, which aims to provide housing and supportive services to women who are in treatment."
"She's a care coordinator, which is another role that we offer,and operates the You Shine Too, which is a provider of the Free Through Recovery program."
She's also volunteered in jail ministry for 12 years and facilitating a group called Stepping Up and Stepping Out.
"Words can't express how grateful we are to all the peer support specialists, the hundreds of peer support specialists across the state who are using their lived experience with addiction to help others overcome it."
Representing that entire group we've got the amazing Deborah here today and I want to have her stand and let's thank her and all the peer support specialists across North Dakota.
"Folks like Deborah make our communities a better place to live, but North Dakota is only as strong as its communitiesand that's what the Main Street Initiative is about."
"It's about building healthy, vibrant communities with smart infrastructure that will attract and retain a 21st century workforce.That's what it's about."
The way we go about that is we start with listening.
To date we've held listening sessions across the state.
71 communities engaged in the initiatives.
They account for 86% of North Dakota's incorporated population.
"For those sessions we've heard common challenges that are facing communities large and small, and it's no surprise that workforce retention and attraction rises to the top of their list."
"Now more than ever, North Dakota is competing with the rest of the world for workforce."
"With unemployment at 2.4% and over 30,000 jobs open in the state of North Dakota with record low unemployment nationwide, businesses and communities are struggling to attract workers and as a result, businesses are struggling with succession planning."
Main Street businesses; who's going to take over my business?
How am I going to grow my business if I can't get workers?We have to work to break down the barriers to employment.
"Working with the legislature last year, as we talked about earlier, we removed the occupational licensing and certification barriers for military spouses."
But we still have too much red tape across 80 licensing organizations.
We're losing ground to states like Arizona that last year adopted universal licensing recognition.
Arizona is recognizing any other state's certification to allow you to work.
"If you're a teacher, if you're a lawyer, if you're a counselor, if you have another state, you can work in Arizona."
"Because when you attract workforce, there's always going to be a trailing spouse, not just in the military."
And people won't move here if their spouse can't get a job because of licensure barriers.
"Building on the studies that have been done by the legislature and the Workforce Development Council, we can break down these barriers and unleash a bottled-up economy, because the number one gating factor on our growth of our economy right now is the lack of qualified workforce."
Trends show that job seekers are choosing where to live based on the community first and they get a job second.
"If you've got the skills, you can live anywhere in the U. S. right now."
"But what we're doing is working with the Main Street Initiative,and this year nationally, we just recently we had two communities in North Dakota that were recognized as the two hottest job markets in America."
Fargo came out number oneon the list and Bismarck came out number nine on that list.
"And we know we've got a lot of great communities, but these were two that made the national hottest job market lists."
"And to help continue pushing this forward for all the communities that are involved in Main Street and understand their needs and their desired amenities, we're working on delivering planning tools."
That's why today we're announcing a new program called Partners in Planning to fill a funding gap for local planning projects to support sound development decisions.
This program will provide grants to fund comprehensive plans or economic development or diversification strategies.
Applications for the first round will be due in March.
"So cities, if you're listening, look for more information on the Department of Commerce website.We'd love to have you apply."
We also understand that these plans require investment.
"That's why with Commerce, we're excited to announce the Community Vibrancy Programs."
This is a grant that helps communities fund small projects designed to build engagement and momentum to attract 21st century workforce.
"Amenities are great for attracting workforce, but they're pointless if high taxes are scaring people away from your community."
"And we need communities that aredesigned to limit their property tax by design, not grow it."
"And we can do this by building smart, efficient infrastructure that utilizes design principles such as infill development and mixed-use buildings that raises the amount of revenue and activity for the amount of infrastructure that is there."
Communities have a choice about how and where they spend their dollars.
And as we look at growing populations it's imperative that we fully utilize the existing infrastructure we've already built to support that growth rather than extending new infrastructure that raises everyone's property taxes.
"Some examples of some great mixed-use infill projects from both ends of the state:Williston with their Renaissance on Main,a multi-use building downtown, private-public funds, once was a parking lot with low tax generation,now has got retail, restaurants, business and housing, all built over existing infrastructure."
And right here in downtown Grand Forks with the new Pure Development project.
"It's going to featurea full-blown grocery store, bank and apartment complex, adding vibrancy to a well-established neighborhood."
"Those are the kinds of projects where private capital coming to existing infrastructure, high return on investment for taxpayers."
"Opposite of thatis public dollars, like a new elementary school built a mile out of town."
That's public dollars requiring more public infrastructure.Low return for taxpayers.
"So again, we have an opportunity through our design choices to drive taxes down,because taxesare driven by the footprint of the city."
"We have another Main Street Initiative(summit), but the last one was fantastic."
Over a thousand people were there this past October.We had leaders nationally.
We had success stories locally.
"Again, we'll be back in Bismarck October 6th and 7th."
"If you have anything to do with workforce, with building a city, with your community, with a school district, there's going to be things here that you're going to want to see, whether it's arts, education, community building."
Do not miss next year's Main Street Summit.
"That brings us to the conclusion about our five major initiatives; reinventing government, tribal partnerships, transforming education, behavioral health and addiction, and the Main Street Initiative."
"We know that we have made progress across all of these and as we look ahead, we know that there's more work that we need to do in all of these areas, but we can set a generational change and chart a course for future generations by continuing to partner on these five strategic initiatives."
"We're unique in North Dakota that we also, on top of all the resources we have, we're also coming at a point,a fork in the road,where we get to decide what do we do and how do we build a legacy for the future."
"We find ourselves today,thanks to a vote of the peoplethat passedthe Legacy Fund,$6.8 billion and growing in theLegacy Fund."
"And if that's managed correctly for the generations, for the decades to come, it will continue to grow and it'll help North Dakota reach its full potential."
"But it will also provide its most essential act, which it will protect the citizens."
"These students that are here today, 10 or 20 or 30 years from now, when we do not have, as we had in this last biennium, $4.8 billion of oil tax revenue came in to fund various things that stayed in North Dakota, both in and outside the general fund, $4.8 billion."
"When that number declines or goes to zero because of new technologies and new approaches to energy in the future, the Legacy Fund earnings will need to replace that $4.8 billion, which means that we have to be very smart about how we spend it today to make sure that it has the earnings power to replace a major source of tax revenue in the future."
"When voters approved that earlier thing, all of that from 2010 to 2017 it stayed inthe principal and kept building."
"Today, the Legacy Fund receives 30% of oil tax revenue."
That'll amount to another $1.3 billion this biennium.
The Legacy Fund earnings then that come out of that endowment are transferred to the general fund.
The legislature can decide how they want to spend them.
That transfer will likely exceed $400 million this (biennium).
So then the question is how do you balance saving for the future and spending on things right now?
"When we look at that, if you said, let's only invest half of it, but let's reinvest the other half, let's reinvest the other half back into the Legacy Fund, if you reinvest half of it, then we set ourselves on a path where in just a short 13 years from now we would have built up an over $26 billion Legacy Fund, which would be, I call it a good start."
Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund is a trillion.
$26 billion would be a good start.
"But our number one priority should be protecting ourselves andfuture generations from these downturns, which can occur from market forces and world events beyond our course."
"Beyond that, then we can make a choice about how do wewant to invest this."
"And dollars that are not reinvested ought to have a very, very high bar."
They should be used for strategic investments.
And we propose that it's possible that you could have things that were worthy of a legacy project across three areas.
One of them is smart infrastructure.
"When we think about smart infrastructure, we've got a lot of needs in the state."
"For us to be successful, we've got to have broadband everywhere."
We've got to have the statewide buildout of the UAS network.
We've got to have things like four-laning of highways that are essential to our major industries.
So we need to think about those very strategically; statewide infrastructure.
"We're covering off on local infrastructure because of the $250 million financial support to community cities and townships to enhance local infrastructure that was passed by the legislature through Operation Prairie Dog, so there's already $250 million of revenue that are already flowing through that."
"So we have to have ahigher bar for theLegacy Fund,in that infrastructure would have to support commerce, improve safety, or drive economic diversity or prosperity."
"Over the next 10 months our team is going to work between now and the legislative session to lay out a 10-year infrastructure plan to try to identify those things of the highest value and the highest order that would advance our statewide infrastructure, help prepare us for emergencies, reduce risk, build communities, and envision transportation modes of the future when we'll havetransportation modes that go beyond our high dependence on automobiles."
So that's the smart infrastructure piece.
Property tax relief gets talked about a lot.
The state is already helping to reduce local property tax burden.
We approved $174 million in permanent property tax relief last session by assuming the cost of social services.
"In addition, the state pays a significant portion to theK-12 formula."
"And on top of that we've got the $250 million Prairie Dog, which could be used to help reduce propertytaxes."
So the state is doing a lot on that burden right now.
"But the primary driver of property taxes is driven by local decision-making at the city level, the county level, the school board level, the park district level."
"And it's the footprint of the community and the design of the community, the design decisions that drive the cost to the taxpayers."
A bigger footprint costs more to build.
"It costs more to plow, it costs more to police, it costs more for fire, it costs more for garbage collection."
So footprint is a direct cost layer.
"So again, if people are saying I want to have lower property taxes, the first place to do is get involved and understanding the economics of your local community andthe decisions that are being made that are driving taxes up versus could be driving taxes down."
"So if Legacy Fund dollars are going to be involved here, the last thing we want to do is take Legacy Fund dollars and subsidize uneconomic activity at the local level."
That'd be the last thing you'd want to do.
You would want to incentivize smart growth versus subsidize uneconomic growth.
"That could be as simple as, as I said, the basic principles are there; attracting capital to existing infrastructure versus using public dollars to build new infrastructure on the edge."
Those are two opposing choices.
"One of them lowers taxes and improves walkability and health outcomes, and the other one increases property taxes and perhaps increases isolation because everybody's driving around in cars."
"Anyway, we have choices to make."
We could be the state that actually builds some of the most interesting 21st century communities in the world if we're smart about how we use these dollars as incentives to incentivize people to make decisions that will lower property taxes.
"When we think about maximizing our impact for transformational legacy projects, that's the third bucket, so we talked about strategic infrastructure, incentivizing smart growth, and then talking about the maximizer impact."
"There's five criteria that welaid out before which we still stand behind, which is if it's really a legacy project it ought to have an impact, not just to the current but the future generation."
"It ought to impact all the people that can't vote, that are below 18 that are going to be living in this state in the future, and the students that are here."
"It ought to have regional, state or national or international impact or influence."
"If possible, it should leverage other financial support like we did with the TR library where we get two-for-one private dollars coming in to match an endowment that doesn't even leave the state."
I mean that's as high ROI as a thing aswe’llever get to pass in the state.Let's do more like that.
Support communities to diversify their economy.We should do that.
And we should also make sure that we're not growing government.
And that includes not growing the cost of the linear feet of roads to plow and everything else.
"And it ought to be one-time spending,because no matter how transformational a project is,if we're in a spot 20 years in the future and oiltax revenues drive up, then we're going to have to stop doing transformational legacy projects and use those legacy earning dollars to cover the core cost ofgovernment."
So we should never put ourselves ina position where legacy funds are funding core government because then we're going to be in a huge bind down the road.
"Anyway, those are some themes for that."
"When we think about that future that we have, investing in infrastructure, investing in incentingsmart growth, transformational projects, we can improve the quality of life for all North Dakotans.We can help attract workforce."
"We can diversify our economy and we can ensure that the state is well-positioned, not just for today, but for future generations."
"And so, as we close this, just think about this a little bit."
"Imagine if you do, we have all these resources and we're in a nimble state and we're small and we can all get together."
"Imagine,if you will, a time in North Dakota when all 30,000 jobs are filled; what would that feel like?"
"What would that do to our sales tax and our top line, the bottom line of all the private organizations?"
"What would do to healthcare, to teaching, to nursing if we had those filled?Let's imagine a day when we've got vibrant, safe and welcoming communities that have got deep engagement and lots of fulfilling activities for those that are under age 21."
"When we did the listening sessions, one of the things we heard across the state was that there aren't enough thingsto do for kids that are not old enough to go to a bar, even in our college towns.Let's solve that problem."
Let's figure out a way to have deep engagement and purpose in community with people that are under age 21.
Imagine our cities are so safe that our police are bored.
"Imagine that we don't have to build any more jails or correction systems, that they're emptying out."
"Imagine that instead of spending $41,000 a year incarcerating someone with the disease of addiction, we're using a fraction of that to help them stay in recovery so they can be with their families and have productive and healthy lives."
Imagine a time when our universities are growing again.
They've overcome all the challenges of the new dynamic forces of competition.They are transforming.Student debt is dropping.K-12 outcomes are soaring.
Our state educational offerings are preparing learners of all ages for purposeful lives in the 21st century.
"Imagine if we've successfully solved for the world carbon capture and we've turned CO2 from an unwanted by-product into a value-added ingredient for energy production, for agricultural production, for manufacturing and construction."
These visions are all within our grasp.
We live in a time of unprecedented prosperity and abundance.
We live in a nation that was built by entrepreneurs and innovators who are forging our future.
And it's not thislack of resources that’sgoing to hold us back from achieving any of these visions; it's going to be about us and our values and how we apply them.
"But with curiosity to gain new knowledge, to not be afraid of the future, with the humility to let go of and stop defending the status quo, we do not need to defend institutions, whether they've been here a year or 10 years or 100years or 150 years, let's just let it go.The future is upon us."
Let's have the humility to say that we are able to learn new things and the humility to understand that things that we thought were true are not true.
"The world isn't going to run out of energy and it's not going to runout of food, and we can solve the carbon issue with innovation."
Let's have the humility to understand that.
Let's have the courage to face the change and the uncertainty.
"And if we have those values, then what we can achieve is really, really unlimited."
"It's true that many of us love our state and we love it for all the reasons that are personal to us, and might see images or think of friends or coaches or towns we grew up in or people we've met or relationships or schools or institutions, but all of us can think back to those points when we literally had the feeling of love towards the place that we grew up."
"We have an opportunity to not just feel that feeling of love for a place or for people, but we have an opportunity to demonstrate that love in smalland mighty ways that bring us together as North Dakotans."
People know that I've been a basketball player all my life.I retired about a year ago.
Scott Davis is trying to get me to come out of retirement.
I've been a basketball player and a fan my whole life.
"This week the world lost a giant in the sport, a player whose work ethic, drive to win, set him apart and inspired millions, inspired a generation."
But there's another basketball player that you might all know and somebody might know personally.He used to play here.
Just down the road on the other side of campus.His name was Phil Jackson.
"Of course he played for Williston, went to UND, played for the New York Knicks, coached 11 NBA championships, more than any coach in history."
And of course he had the pleasure and the honor of coaching Kobe Bryant through all five of those NBA championships.
"Under Coach Jackson's leadership, they succeeded not just because of Kobe and other teammates’incredible talent and hard work, but Coach Jackson knew how to instill the importance, the essential nature of teamwork, of caring for your fellow team members, really thinking of them ahead of yourself, which is a form of love, loving your teammates."
"Pulled them together into cohesive units, even when the differences they may have had seemed destined to pull them apart."
Because of that talent that coach Jackson had he's often been called the Zen master of basketball.
"And he once said, ""The strength of theteam is each individual member, andthe strength of each individual member is the team."
"As we conclude today, we've got so many reasons to be grateful."
We've got so many reasons to be curious.
"But let's definitely figure out a way as a state to work together as a team, to love our neighbors, love our communities, and love our state, and to help each citizen."
"By doing this, by loving our neighbors, loving our communities, and loving our state, that's how we're going to help each citizen reach their fullest potential."
We're going to help to empower people to improve their lives and inspire their success.
I want to say thank you all for being here today.Thanks for listening.
And may God bless the great State of North Dakota.
