SENTENCES
"Madame Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, honorable members of the Governor's Council and the House and Senate, my fellow citizens of New Hampshire: Thank you for the honor you have given me and the sacred trust you have placed in me."
It is a very special privilege.
To all of you in this chamber and to every citizen of our great state I pledge my full devotion to the solemn oath I have just taken.
This is an historic moment for our state.
This magnificent building is the oldest state capitol in the nation that still serves as a legislative chamber.
"In this historic building I stand before you as the thankful daughter of two hardworking and caring parents, as the grateful wife of a loving and supportive husband, as the proud mother of three wonderful daughters -- and now, as the first elected woman Governor of the state of New Hampshire."
"I am honored and proud to share this important day in our state's history not just with New Hampshire's other daughters and wives and mothers, but with all the people of New Hampshire."
I am equally proud and honored to be part of a long New Hampshire tradition of steadily opening the doors of democratic government.
"This tradition started with Marilla Ricker, a courageous woman who first tried to vote in Dover in 1870 and in 1910 dared to file her candidacy for governor."
"This tradition continued last month, when the House of Representatives elected its first woman speaker."
"Madame Speaker, let me congratulate you on your historic election."
"But as I have said before, I did not seek this office to make history but rather to make a difference in the lives of every New Hampshire family."
This is my promise to the people of this great state: I will work to bring people together to solve the problems we face.
Together we will make our government work better.
"And this, too, is my challenge to the people of New Hampshire, because if we are to succeed, we must write these new chapters in New Hampshire history together."
We must focus on what's important to our families and our future.
We must work together to make our dreams real.
"Instead of allowing fear to divide us, we must let hope bring us together."
"Above all, we must never forget this simple truth: New Hampshire belongs to all of us."
And so today I invite every New Hampshire citizen to become a part of our history and a part of our future.
"If you have an idea about how to improve the quality of life in our state, I want to hear it."
"If you know a way to help our state government work better, I want you to share it with me."
"If there is something that you or your business or your school or your community is doing right and the rest of us can learn from it, I want to see it.I'm going to listen.I'm going to learn."
"And with your help, we will take action to meet the challenges we face: improving our schools; lowering electric rates; protecting health care; creating jobs, and building our economy."
"Beginning in these first days as Governor and continuing through every day of my service, the door to my office will be open to the people of New Hampshire."
"To those in this chamber today who share the responsibility of elected state office and to our dedicated state employees, let me extend this invitation to you as well."
The door of the Governor's office stands open to you and your ideas.
In the days ahead we will not always agree on every issue.
But let us agree from the beginning that no political party is the sole font of wisdom; that name-calling never solved a single problem; and that democratic government is about tending to the people's business.
The people of New Hampshire are not looking to us for partisanship; they want leadership.So let us provide it.
"Leadership requires us to recognize the difference between what makes New Hampshire special and what threatens its future, between what must be protected and what can no longer be tolerated as status quo."
I will soon be presenting a budget for the next biennium.
Budget hearings held recently by Governor Merrill made clear there are more requests than money.
"Let me be equally clear: the budget I will present will be balanced, and it will not include a broad-based sales or income tax."
"I said it during my campaign and I will say it again now: I will not propose or support such a tax, and if this legislature passes one, I will veto it."
That is a New Hampshire tradition I will preserve.
But there are others we must change.
"For too long, we have been paying the highest electric rates in the nation."
"They constitute a hidden tax, taking money away from families already struggling to make ends meet."
"They are increasing the costs of running our businesses, our towns and our state."
We have already taken the first steps toward introducing competition into the electric industry.
"We must continue down that path to competition with steadfast resolve, while seeking to avoid a lengthy court battle that could further threaten our economic competitiveness."
"But our task is clear: high electric rates are a threat to our economic future, and they must come down."
We must make sure quality health care is affordable and accessible to all our families.
The increasing number of families who rely on managed care should be protected from those practices that put profits first and patients second.
"And as our population ages, we must develop alternatives to costly nursing home care, alternatives that allow our senior citizens to remain at home and in their communities."
We must put in place a comprehensive plan that will strengthen and build our economy.
We must do better at coordinating state agencies and promoting programs that stimulate investment and growth.
We must have a state where a clean environment and safe streets are a central ingredient of economic prosperity.
"Everything we do must move New Hampshire toward the same goal: building a state of good-paying jobs, hardworking people, and secure and thriving families."
And let us agree on this: our future depends on the quality of education we provide our children.
"To compete successfully in the 21st century, New Hampshire must have citizens who are better prepared and better educated."
"So let me state this as strongly as I can: I will make education a priority--in my budget, in my appointments, and in the full weight and visibility granted by this office."
"Without intruding upon the tradition of local control, the state has a vital role to play in education.It must provide leadership."
"As Governor, I will soon be convening an Education Summit to focus on this most critical issue."
"This education summit will bring together teachers and parents, administrators and academics, students and business people--every sector of our society."
Our goal will be to create an action plan to ensure that education in New Hampshire helps our children meet the challenges of the next century.
Because the quality of our schools and the education our children receive affect every one of us.
But there are some things we already know we must do.
"In New Hampshire, public education should begin with kindergarten."
We are the only state in the nation in which public kindergarten is not available to every five-year old.
"Many states are now moving beyond kindergarten, offering public pre-school programs to three- and four-year-olds."
They understand that an earlier start equals a better student; a better student makes a better worker and citizen; and better citizens and workers build stronger communities.
All of us were charmed and impressed by the kindergarten students from the Rumford School here in Concord who led us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Let us pledge to these boys and girls that we will not rest until the opportunity of public kindergarten is extended to every five-year-old in every school system in every town in New Hampshire.
For too long the vital issue of education has been sidetracked into arguments about ideology and politics.
"And each time that's happened, valuable time and scarce resources have been wasted."
"Each time, the distractions of politics have robbed a little more from our children's and our state's future."
Let me assure every citizen of New Hampshire--those days are over.
We are here to serve the people of New Hampshire.
"They are not interested in whether we are Republicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives, men or women."
"What they expect from us is results, or at least an honest effort to achieve them."
That is our responsibility to the people of our great state.
That is how they -- and history -- will judge us.
"After all, history is not only comprised of epic events, but also of the quiet, steady work of people striving together to make tomorrow a little better than today."
"For now, join me in celebrating this moment."
"And tomorrow let us begin the quiet, steady work of the people."
Let us do it without acrimony or bitterness.
Let us do it without petty partisanship.And let us do it together.
"Then, we will truly make history.Thank you."
