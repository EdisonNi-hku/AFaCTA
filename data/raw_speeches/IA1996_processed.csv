SENTENCES
"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Justices and Judges, State Officials, Senators and Representatives, Distinguished Guests and Friends."
"Birthdays are a time to celebrate, give thanks, and reflect."
"And so it is today as we gather in this, the 150th year of Iowa's Statehood.We should celebrate.We have a right to."
The condition of our state is not just good .it is great.
Iowa is as strong as it's ever been and poised to grow even stronger.We should give thanks.
Thanks to the pioneers who tamed the wilderness and forged the communion we still today have with this beautiful land.
"Thanks to the leaders like former Governor and current Sesquicentennial Chair Bob Ray, Co-chair C. J. Niles, members of the Sesquicentennial Commission and the many former elected state officials who have joined us for this special occasion."
I ask that this group stand and be recognized.We should reflect.
Reflect on this special place between two great rivers that we call Iowa.
"It's a place where hard work, common sense, family, and faith in God still count for something."
"I believe as sure as I am standing before you today that this is a blessed place; that this state has not happened by chance, but by the grace of God."
We are so fortunate to be Iowans.
"It is entirely proper that our celebrations, our thanksgivings, and our reflections turn to the past as we mark this important milestone in our state's history."
"Hugh Sidey, the Greenfield, Iowa native who is a contributing editor of Time magazine, put it best when he wrote that our state ""has a subtle magic which was God-given at first, but has been protected and enlarged by Iowa's generations and now yields a culture that has remarkable virtues."
"Ours is a state of good people, closely tied to the rhythms of nature with a stability and resilience that was, and still is, uncommon."
"Where else can a young boy be taught by his father that life is not a sprint, it's a marathon and take that lesson and teach it to his children?Only here in Iowa."
"It is here that the character of a people, though weathered by 150 years of flood and drought, depression and war, has emerged stronger and tougher than ever before."
Just look at a few of our accomplishments over the past year.
Our economy is thriving; our fiscal condition is sound; our communities are growing; and our families are stronger.
Today: More Iowans are working than ever before and our unemployment rate remains at half the national average.
Exports and land values continue to rise.
"For the first half of 1995, we saw exports jump 29% and land values increased by over 7% last year."
Our state budget is in the best condition in a generation with cash reserves full and a surplus of $435 million.
"Iowa school children continue to receive a truly first class education with more students taking courses in foreign languages, higher levels of math and science, and advanced placement."
We are one of the best places in the country to raise a family.
Kids Count ranks us second in the quality of life for children.
Our focus on jobs and quality education has paid off.
"Today, Iowa is truly a vibrant, growing state, even though just a few years ago the ""experts"" said we were destined for decline."
"Well, they couldn't measure with their census tracts the character and resilience of Iowans."
"But as we celebrate and give thanks for our successes let us remember that this is not a sprint, but a marathon."
And the finish line has yet to be crossed.
We must not now abandon that common sense and constancy of purpose which has been the hallmark of our character.
"Today, we stand at the threshold of a new century, poised for greatness and it is those very same qualities that will help us build on our success and make it last."
"We must seize this day, and fashion a future string of endless success stories: of families coming back home for good paying jobs; of communities with new leaders and new life; of a state known for steady growth.How do we do it?"
"First, we must remember the lesson of our ancestors -- that educating our citizens is government's most important task."
"The progressive nature of Iowans was never demonstrated more clearly than in 1839, when Iowa's territorial government set up the first free public schools."
They made sure that a schoolhouse was within two miles of every Iowan.
"Today, those one room township schoolhouses are gone."
"But in their place, we have 384 local school districts, many non-public schools, three world-renowned state universities, 35 independent colleges and universities, and 15 area community colleges."
"In the last decade, we have taken education in Iowa to new heights, but now we must go even further."
There is no state in the nation which is better prepared to educate its children to succeed in the Information Age than we are today in Iowa.
"Just as we were ahead of the times in 1839, our investment in the Iowa Communications Network vaults us ahead of other states and countries in the education of our children."
"In his new book, The Road Ahead, Bill Gates, the visionary founder of Microsoft, discusses how important it is for us to use technology and the information superhighway to advance education."
I'm sure even Bill Gates would be impressed if he knew that his vision for the future is up and running in Iowa today.
"Soon every school district will have access to two-way, interactive classes provided by the Iowa Communications Network."
"The ICN will make certain that distance or size does not disadvantage any student, even in the smallest or most remote school district of this state.Look around you."
Almost every work place -- even this House -- is run by the computer.
Yet too few of our students have access to computer-aided instruction.We need to change that.
"By the year 1999, every Iowa high school student should have access to the information superhighway and be taught by teachers who are trained to deliver the technological know-how necessary to prepare them for the jobs of the next millennium."
"I am proposing we establish a four-year, $150 million School Improvement and Technology Fund to provide our local schools with the flexibility and resources they need to bring the opportunities of the Information Age to every Iowa student."
Our schools must continue to be places where our children are enabled to reach the limits of their talents; where they can exceed their ambitions; and where they will be able to progress beyond the dreams of their parents.This is the Iowa dream.
We all know there is more to improving Iowa's schools than computers and technology alone.
The teacher will always be fundamental to our system of quality education.
We must take steps this year to redevelop the teaching profession so that teachers are prepared to equip our children with the skills to compete in the 21st century.
"Now, we must also strengthen our state's commitment to equitable local school funding while we reduce reliance on property taxes."
"That is why I am proposing that from now on all allowable growth in school budgets be paid for by the state, and not the local property taxpayer."
This is an historic move that will greatly strengthen all of our schools for the future.
"Just two months after Iowa became a state, our first state university was chartered."
"Iowa's state universities are among the finest public universities in America, offering a quality, affordable education, conducting trend-setting research, and serving as a valuable tool for economic development."
"In preparing for the future, we should make key strategic investments in facilities so our Regents' institutions can grow to meet the challenges that lie ahead."
"I am recommending a three-year, $66 million program to fund facilities for biological sciences, the performing arts, engineering, and livestock research at our state universities."
Our independent colleges and universities attract students from Iowa and all over the country -- most of whom stay here to live and work.
"To meet rising education costs, we should increase the Iowa Tuition Grant, which helps keep some of our best and brightest young people here in Iowa."
Our community colleges are our link to the workforce.
The training and education they provide to our workforce helps make Iowa workers the most productive in the land.
These colleges will play a key role as we restructure our workforce development programs.
We must stay on the course for economic development.
Our continuous improvement strategy to attract good-paying jobs is working.
"Last year, we made progress by eliminating the property tax on machinery and equipment."
We cannot afford to stop there.
"This session, we must reform our regulatory system to keep Iowa on a course for growth and opportunity for the next 150 years."
"We should also take new steps to improve our overall competitiveness, helping both families and small businesses grow."
"Iowans work hard all their lives to leave a family farm, business, or other assets to their children."
"But for too many Iowans, that dream is eroded by a state inheritance tax."
We should eliminate the inheritance tax among family members to protect family farms and businesses and to keep more of our citizens here in their retirement years.
We can help small business by giving them the same benefits our tax structure offers to larger corporations.
"And, all Iowans would be helped by fully indexing the state income tax rates."
We also need to reform our property tax system.
The current system is hopelessly complicated and archaic.
"There are 8,000 different jurisdictions that can levy property taxes and there are numerous credits, many of which aren't fully funded."
"Over the last 13 years, we have spent $900 million in property tax relief, yet few Iowans have seen their property taxes go down."
"We need to make it fairer, simpler, and less of a burden."
It is time to start fundamentally changing it with a top-to-bottom review as we prepare for comprehensive reform next year.
"To help control both spending and taxes, we should adopt the Taxpayers Rights Amendment to the Iowa Constitution."
The growth of government should be limited to the rate of inflation and increases in population unless it is approved by a vote of the people.
"As a state, we have learned some difficult lessons."
"In the past, we became complacent and lost our competitive edge."
We will not let that happen again.
We also have a responsibility to see to it that all Iowa communities have the opportunity to share in our economic success.
"The New Jobs and Income Program, adopted just two years ago, has generated $1.6 billion in capital investment and created hundreds of quality jobs."
We should make this tool available to smaller projects in rural communities.
And let us never forget our economic backbone -- agriculture.
We need to take full advantage of new opportunities which lie in the area of value-added agriculture.
The list of products made from our agricultural commodities grows longer each year.
"Ethanol processing now employs 12,000 Iowans and is responsible for 11% of net farm income."
"The Asian market is hungry for our food products, and we are preparing to intensify our promotion of Iowa Quality Meats."
We must improve our farm cooperative laws and allow farmers to have greater ownership and involvement in the value-added processing industry.
"As we help our livestock producers meet new challenges, we must also recognize the need to protect our rural quality of life."
Education and economic development.
That's what brought us success and will make it last.
"As we continue to grow and prosper, we must never neglect the quality of life we have in this state."
Our state is only as good as its families and communities.
"So many of the problems we face today, as a nation and as a state, can be traced back to the decay of the family."
"Unfortunately, government policies have inadvertently perpetuated illegitimacy, torn families apart, and robbed children of opportunity."
"This year, we are launching a Campaign for the Family."
"It is designed to strengthen and reconnect families by focusing on stability, health, safety, and self-sufficiency."
"Iowa's success in the next century and a half depends on the vitality of our homes, churches, neighborhoods, and communities."
Government can't rebuild a family.
That is the responsibility of individuals.
We can encourage the exercise of individual responsibility.
"So at the risk of being dubbed old-fashioned, I believe that we can, as a state, reinforce the two-parent family for the good of children."
"Each year, more than a million children go through divorce in this country."
"And while there are many single parents who are doing a great job, we've seen that children who grow up without the benefit of having both parents at home are five times more likely to live in poverty and two and a half times more likely to be dropouts, commit serious crimes, abuse drugs, or get pregnant."
I believe we should reform our divorce laws to require mutual consent or specific grounds for divorce.
Our present no-fault divorce laws have transformed marriage into an arrangement of convenience rather than an act of commitment.
Parents need to understand that a divorce can severely hurt children and impact the opportunities their kids have.
Please join me in our effort to find a better way.
"As part of our Campaign for the Family, we want to reduce out-of-wedlock births and reengage fathers, holding them to their parental responsibilities and assuring them of their parental rights."
I believe parents deserve the right to know when their child is undergoing a significant medical procedure.
We should require parental notification before an abortion can be performed on a minor.
Strong families provide the fertile soil from which strong people and solid communities grow.
The key to addressing these problems lies in reconnecting and reinforcing Iowa's families.
This is even more critical as power shifts away from the federal government.
"The devolution of power from Washington to states, local communities, and inevitably to families and individuals, gives us both an opportunity and a challenge."
"It is an opportunity to take charge of our own destiny, find solutions that best fit our own problems, and empower individuals and communities to fashion their own futures.But it is also a challenge."
We must be prepared to bear the burden of authority and accept responsibility for our own actions.
Iowans are better prepared than most to meet that challenge.
The spirit of neighbor helping neighbor is as Iowan as the tall corn we grow.
"State government, too, must be prepared to meet the challenge."
We must not become a bottleneck in the historic flow of power from Washington to the family.
We must rise to our new responsibilities and reshape state government.
"In Iowa, the transformation of our welfare system serves as a model for empowering individuals and families."
Our Family Investment Program has helped thousands of families gain self-sufficiency and has broken the culture of dependency.
"From workforce development to Medicaid to our child welfare system, new flexibility from the federal government will allow us to design a state government that is results-oriented, customer-focused, competitively-based, and most important, relies on a partnership with communities, churches, and families."
One size does not fit all when it comes to helping families in need; government must be changed to better meet the true needs of those we are trying to help.
"All Iowans want to live in safe communities, having streets, schools, and homes that are free from the cancer of violent crime."
"We have among the lowest crime rates in the nation, but we are all troubled by the level of violence and drug-related crime in our state."
Every Iowan has the right to feel safe and secure and that should be our guiding principle.
"To protect Iowans, I believe we should reinstate the death penalty for those who commit two class ""A"" felonies, one of which is murder."
"Rape and kidnap victims, prison guards, and the innocent people of Iowa deserve this protection."
The clear majority of Iowans support capital punishment.
It is time for us to answer the call of the people and restore the death penalty.
We must not waver in our war on crime.
We should eliminate parole for forcible felons and sexual predators.
The most dangerous criminals should not be given a second chance to rob or rape again.
"In addition, juveniles involved in crime must be held accountable for their actions."
Public disclosure of juvenile arrests and greater access to records will send a strong message and help stop young people from progressing to a life of adult crime.
"In less than a year, we have seen the use of methamphetamines in Iowa double."
"Already, we have launched an ambitious prevention campaign, and I am recommending increased penalties for making and dealing in ""crank."
This scourge cannot be allowed to infect our communities and destroy the lives of more Iowans.
"Until we show criminals that their actions do not pay, there is no hope of stopping the few that disrupt the safe and peaceful lives of Iowans."
We have made good progress in the last couple of years in addressing our need for more prison space.
"This year, we should authorize construction of another 750 bed prison and use prison labor to remodel and reopen cellhouse 17 at Fort Madison."
"When I grew up in rural Iowa, we didn't need locks on our doors."
"Let us work together to restore that sense of security once again to the neighborhoods, schools, and homes of Iowa."
"As a state, we are better prepared than ever to act on the priorities I have outlined for you today."
We made the tough decisions that Washington is only now beginning to grapple with.Our actions have paid off.
No state in the nation stands in the solid financial position we are in today.
Our cash reserves are full and we have a GAAP balance of $435 million.
"This year, Financial World magazine ranked Iowa as the 6th best managed state in the nation."
Our goal should be no less than to be the best managed state in the nation.
"This year, we must continue to live by the spending reforms that took our state government from a $400 million deficit to a surplus that is even greater."
This budget that I am presenting to you protects our cash reserves and keeps ongoing expenditures at 4% growth.
"We know from our history that there are times to reap and times to sow, that there are droughts and floods that follow bin-busting harvests."
We must be prudent in our spending today so that we will be able to meet the needs of Iowans when times are leaner.
We are also working to make state government more accountable and responsive.
"The bi-partisan Council on Human Investment, chaired by Lt. Governor Joy Corning, is developing and implementing a new state budget system that ties expenditures to the results Iowans want."
"The system, called Budgeting for Results, will be used by seven agencies beginning this year and will be expanded to all state agencies by the year 2000."
This is also the time to pay attention to our infrastructure needs.
It is this generation's turn to invest in our public facilities.
"Therefore, I am recommending that we establish a permanent Infrastructure Fund that will provide a reliable and steady stream of funding to build and rebuild our public buildings and infrastructure."
"This year, we Iowans have much to celebrate, much to give thanks for, much to reflect upon."
"Iowa's subtle magic, that Hugh Sidey described, has indeed been protected and enlarged."
"Today, we are better prepared for our future than ever before."
But birthdays involve gift-giving.
And it is that last feature of our sesquicentennial that we must also remember throughout this year.
"As citizens, each of us should take the time this year to help out a friend in need; assist a family in trouble; help clean up a park; coach the local team; serve on a community board; and say a prayer for our local troops overseas."
These are gifts we can give our state.
"They will make this an even better, more civil place."
Such giving is one of the remarkable virtues which have been given to us by those who have gone before us.
"As public servants, we should use this year to give to the state our commitment to do what is best for Iowa."
The course I have laid out for you is ambitious and challenging.
But it is a steady course; a clear course for our future.
"Our gift to this state in its 150th year should be to leave all personal, partisan, or private interests at the door."
For this must be the place where the public interest rules.
"And, we and those we serve will be better for it."
"So let us celebrate, let us give thanks, let us reflect during this year."
Let us give the state the best that is in us.
"With God's help and yours, we can make our state stand out like a candle of light in the Heartland of America -- the same beacon of hope which guided those early pioneers 150 years ago."
"And 150 years from this day, they will look back and thank us for giving them the greatest days in the history of this Great State of Iowa."
"Thank you, God bless you, and Happy Birthday, Iowa."
