My fellow Pennsylvanians: When I asked you to elect me governor, I promised we would do things differently With this budget, I put that promise to paper.
This budget marks a new way of thinking about the relationship between our government, our communities and ourselves.
It is responsible, disciplined, and balanced.
Budget discipline was something my parents understood well.
They made choices every day of their lives.
I still remember my dad sitting at the kitchen table, staying up late, figuring out the best way to provide for his family.
Each check he wrote represented a choice and a priority.
Instead of family vacations to distant places, it was a week enjoying Presque Isle or a visit with my grandparents in Pittsburgh.
Instead of a new car, it was a quality education for my brother, my sister and me.
Like thousands of Pennsylvania families, my parents set priorities, made tough choices, and lived within their means.
Government must do the same.
This budget is meant to trigger a long overdue public debate about the core functions of government.
I define the core functions as these: economic competitiveness, education, helping those who can't help themselves, and public safety.
That's where I put my priorities.
Let's face it, state government can't be all things to all people.
We must choose.
We must decide.
Budget discipline creates opportunity.
This budget is about both.
Discipline.
Spending grows by only 2.3 percent.
The result is opportunity.
Opportunity to cut taxes by more than $200 million.
We cut jobcrushing taxes on employers and employees.
And we eliminate the oppressive widow's tax, two years ahead of schedule.
Discipline.
This budget starts with the first rule of family budgeting don't spend money you don't have.
And so, I based this budget on the most conservative revenue forecasts.
I have proposed to increase by 50 percent the rate at which state government puts aside money in the state's savings account, the Rainy Day fund.
Just as a family tucks away money for car repairs or home improvements, I propose we set aside nearly $60 million $20 million more than the law requires.
Because of such discipline, Pennsylvania will cushion the impact of any economic downturn or probable federal cuts.
Discipline.
This budget rejects the notion that spending and programs must automatically grow.
By exercising such discipline, we can continue the taxforgiveness program for Pennsylvania's working poor.
Discipline.
This budget eliminates 19 programs, saving taxpayers $44 million.
It's never easy to eliminate programs.
In fact, it's darn tough.
Each has a constituency.
But it must be done.
Discipline.
I learned it from my father.
He taught me by example.
Government leaders must set an example as well.
This budget cuts the governor's office by 10 percent, as I pledged last year.
Lt. Gov. Mark Schweiker has taken the same cut.
And I am asking the state's other elected executives Attorney General Preate, Auditor General Hafer and Treasurer Knoll to do their share not by taking a 10% reduction but simply operating at last year's level.
"And I also ask that the Legislature demonstrate their discipline their leadership by eliminating WAMs or ""Walking Around Money."
TAX CUTS/ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Fiscal discipline is critical to provide greater economic opportunity for Pennsylvania.
Everyday we are challenged by the fiercest economic competition the world has ever seen.
And everyday we must look for ways to preserve the jobs we have and to create new ones.
Pennsylvania can't spend its way to prosperity.
We can't afford it and more important it simply doesn't work.
To compete, and to win, Pennsylvania needs a tax and regulatory climate that is proworker, proemployer and progrowth.
Under this proposal, we take Pennsylvania's Corporate Net Income Tax under 10 percent, two years ahead of schedule.
We can not afford to wait.
This reduction will help level the playing field with our neighboring states New York, New Jersey and Ohio.
But there is more to being competitive than lowering the CNI.
New small businesses deserve the chance to survive.
Any employer can tell you that in the early days of a new venture, they are more likely to suffer substantial loss before they experience gain.
Most states reflect that in their tax codes.
But, not Pennsylvania.
Right now, we have the most restrictive Loss Carry Forward provision in the country.
That is about to change.
This arcane sounding but critically important tax incentive encourages new businesses to work through those difficult startup years.
By increasing the deduction to $1 million, 99 percent of our employers and their workers will be given an extra incentive to stay in business.
We will work to bring new jobs to Pennsylvania.
We also have a continuing responsibility to keep the ones we have.
"Toward that end, this budget recommends something called ""doubleweighting."
It's a factor in calculating the CNI.
This concept is simple and relevant.
We reward companies that put their jobs here.
Virtually all of our competitor states have it.
Now Pennsylvania will as well.
Yet, taxes are not the only government impediment to job creation.
So too is the web of government regulations.
Some of you may have heard me mention that I consider the old Department of Environmental Resources to be an obstacle to Pennsylvania's economic growth.
This administration has set about creating a new environmental partnership in Pennsylvania.
My budget starts by splitting DER in two.
One agency will protect our parks and forests.
The second will help Pennsylvanians understand environmental regulations and help them comply.
Pennsylvania's jobcreators not state government must be empowered to expand.
We have redirected our economic development efforts to make them more effective.
We have consolidated 22 programs into 6 favoring a more flexible, efficient and comprehensive approach.
Capitalizing on the programs that work, this budget bolsters The Ben Franklin Partnership and Industrial Resource Centers with nearly $3 million in additional funds to nurture the development of high tech industries.
Targeting promising industries and Pennsylvania's worldclass agricultural products, we will tap the opportunities of the global market with an aggressive export campaign.
I'll make sure of it.
An export team will work out of my office.
And we will invest in three additional international trade offices worldwide.
We will further link Pennsylvania to the world market with a firstclass transportation plan that unites our roads and rails, our harbors and airports.
We have increased funding for repairing our state highways and bridges by almost $45 million.
For the first time, maintenance spending taking better care of our road and bridges will exceed $800 million.
Finally, competitiveness is not just be about nurturing employers.
It's also about nurturing our workers with the education and jobtraining they need.
This budget increases customized jobtraining programs by more than $2 million.
EDUCATION At this point, it is important to remember one basic irrefutable fact.
There is absolutely nothing a parent or government program can do to provide a breadwinner's job unless they have a good education.
The future offers neither hope nor opportunity for the uneducated.
As parents, Michele and I work everyday to nurture the desire to learn in our two young children, Lesley and Tommy.
That's our job as parents.
As governor my job is to make certain that the opportunity of a good education is available to all our children.
By far, education is the Commonwealth's single largest investment.
From kindergarten to college nearly 45% of the budget is dedicated to making education a Pennsylvania priority.
But, I think, for too long, it has been a priority in decline.
So, this budget reverses a seven year trend.
For the first time since 1988, education's share of the budget goes up.
This budget provides an additional $124 million to support the basic education funding subsidy.
Our funding formula will incorporate the equity provisions enacted by the Legislature over the last several years.
But, unlike those years, we will base state aid on enrollment.
Every school district in Pennsylvania will receive at least a modest increase.
But, money alone won't guarantee quality or improvement.
We must do things differently.
Because, in the end, education is not about money, or teachers, school boards or budgets.
It's about our children; their opportunity; and Pennsylvania's future.
I believe parents not government know what is best for their children.
I want families to decide for themselves where their children should attend school.
Why is it that students begin year thirteen of their education by using government funding to attend the school of their choice?
Yet, we routinely deny the same choice from kindergarten through twelve?
The needs of one sevenyearold are different from the next.
Who better to respond to those needs than parents?
This budget empowers parents with the opportunity of school choice.
It provides nearly $40 million for Educational Opportunity Grants.
It is the first installment of a plan that begins with poor and workingclass families.
We will start by reaching into 167 of Pennsylvania's poorest school districts and offering choice to the kids who need it most.
In years two and three, school choice will be a reality statewide.
This budget also encourages the development of charter public schools a new kind of school that provides even more choice within the public school system.
It's an exciting concept.
Parents, teachers, communities together designing their own schools.
Harrisburg mandates will not be an obstacle to local efforts to enrich their children's education.
Our philosophy toward funding higher education changes significantly too.
For years, state government has funded state universities line item by line item and dictated each individual funding priority.
Who in Harrisburg should make spending decisions for these institutions?
In my mind, no one.
Let the schools decide.
In this budget, higher ed is given more flexibility with a studentbased 3% increase.
Half will be used for tuition challenge grants and the other to boost college education grants to include an additional 10,000 students.
We will increase funding to support Community Colleges and to enhance access to public libraries and museums.
WELFARE There is no greater pressure point on Pennsylvania's budget than the ever increasing cost of welfare.
Over the last 10 years, state welfare costs have nearly doubled.
We must control those costs.
We will do so with compassion and common sense.
We will help those who seek to help themselves.
We will care for those who cannot.
This budget continues to provide cash benefits to those who cannot work.
But, it eliminates the $360 in cash that young, single, ablebodied adults with no dependent children receive every two years.
We will continue their health care coverage.
We will continue to make jobtraining available.
But we will not continue to hand out cash to those who are able to work.
The greatest challenge we face is controlling healthcare costs.
The cost of health care for the poor has increased 117% over the last ten years.
It now consumes 16 cents of every state tax dollar.
To control costs, we will insist that those on medical assistance go to a doctor or a clinic for routine treatment not an expensive emergency room.
We will move drug and alcohol rehabilitation out of $600 aday hospitals and into lessexpensive community settings.
We will crack down on prescriptiondrug abuse and we will demand that Pennsylvania receive the same low pharmaceutical prices given to insurance companies and HMOs.
As a forerunner to more comprehensive welfare reform, this budget seeks to move people from the welfare rolls onto a payroll.
We will provide day care for 4,500 additional children enabling thousands of welfare parents to work.
Another great challenge is caring for our seniors.
In this budget, we take an important step.
We help more of our older citizens receive quality care in their own homes.
And we expand the Family Caregiver Program as another alternative to nursing homes.
CRIME The most basic function of government is to ensure the safety of our citizens.
Crime touches each one of us.
The fear of crime haunts us all.
If we live in fear, we cannot learn.
If we work in fear, we cannot compete.
We cannot and will not surrender our streets, schools and communities to fear.
Just six weeks ago, I called the General Assembly into a special session to combat crime.
Your progress has been steady and sure.
For that, Pennsylvania thanks you.
This budget underscores my commitment to protecting Pennsylvania's communities from crime with a $132 million increase.
We must be tough on crime and wise in our use of public resources to combat it.
To keep predators off our streets, we need to build more prisons.
I propose $92 million in the capital budget for 4 new prisons.
One will house adult, another, juveniles convicted as adults.
And I propose two new maximumsecurity youth prisons for violent juvenile offenders.
But there is more to fighting crime.
This budget empowers school districts to create safe schools.
It provides funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
And for the victims of crime for whom we have dedicated the special session, we will: provide additional funding for legal services, speed up victim restitution and guarantee them a state advocate to ensure they are informed of their rights.
This is my budget.
And with it I seek to earn Pennsylvanians' trust.
With it, I have begun to deliver on the promises that Pennsylvanians elected me to pursue: set priorities; make choices.
Discipline does lead to opportunity.
So we must control spending, if we are to cut taxes, which will create the opportunity of more jobs.
Two basic principles guided my budget deliberations.
They should guide yours as well.
First, this budget is about people.
Not percentages or numbers.
Second, every dollar we spend really belongs to decent, honest, hardworking Pennsylvanians.
As their stewards, we are obligated to treat their money as our own.
Members of the General Assembly, it is up to us.
I ask that we work together, Republicans and Democrats, and do our jobs.
We have 116 days.
Let's get to work
