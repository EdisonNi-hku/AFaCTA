SENTENCES
"Chief Judge Kaye, honorable members of the Court of Appeals, Lieutenant Governor McCaughey Ross, Attorney General Vacco, Comptroller McCall, Majority Leader Bruno, Speaker Silver, Leader Reynolds, Leader Connor, respected members of the Legislature, and distinguished guests."
"It is a special pleasure to stand before you in this chamber today, one hundred years after Teddy Roosevelt, who inspired me in so many ways, was first elected to serve the people -- a people, I too, am deeply honored to serve."
There are many special people in my life.
Two of them are in the chamber today.
"Libby, Mom: I’ve said it before: Thank you for all you’ve done for me and our family."
"As we look ahead to the future, let us remember those who are not here, especially our good friend Senator Michael Tully."
"Although Mike is not physically with us today, the spirit of honesty, integrity, and decency that defined the man is very much alive in this chamber."
"Before I report on the state of the state, I think this is a fitting occasion to reflect on how fortunate we are to be living in New York."
I think often about what makes this state so special.
"I think about the courage of immigrants like my grandparents who came to New York with no guarantee of success or happiness -- who tore up centuries -- old roots, left their homelands, and traveled to a place that -- for them -- must have seemed strange and intimidating."
I think of the words of a ten-year-old Italian boy named Edward Corsi.
"Ninety years ago, he and his family boarded a steamer with sixteen hundred other Italian immigrants to pursue their dreams in a place called New York."
"Some years later, he wrote about what it was like on that packed steamer as it passed through the fog of New York Harbor and the immigrants caught their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.He said:."
"""Mothers and fathers lifted up their babies so they, too, could see the Statue of Liberty."
"Looming through the mist, it brought silence to the decks."
Many older persons among us -- burdened with a thousand memories of what they were leaving behind -- had been openly weeping ever since we began our approach to the unknown.
"But now, somewhat steadied by the concreteness of the symbol of Americas freedom, they dried their tears."
What lifted their spirits and gave them strength was more than a glorious statue.
It was a symbol of a lifetime of hope that suddenly materialized before their eyes.
It was the embodiment of everything they had ever hoped for -- affirmation that they had arrived at the place of dreams.
"When I stood here three years ago -- critical of past policies that had failed -- I still believed that New York was that special place: the place where people would come from around the country and around the world, secure in the faith that their hard work, their determination and their effort were the only tools they would need to fulfill the dreams they held for themselves, their children and grandchildren."
"With all my heart, I believed that New York was and always would be the place where any person -- of any background -- of any color, race or gender -- could rise to any level of human fulfillment, and soar to the highest peaks of personal greatness."
But I also knew that it was time to renew our faith in that dream.
"Because three years ago, on that cold day in January -- as we gathered in this chamber to confront the harsh realities -- for too many New Yorkers, the dream seemed dim, elusive and distant."
Too many of our people were suffering -- and too much of that suffering was inflicted upon them by their own government.
New Yorkers were the highest taxed people in America.
New York’s economy had faltered.
High taxes and excessive regulations were driving jobs and opportunities to other states.
"The spirit of imagination, resourcefulness and creativity that gave rise to the greatest state in the nation was withering away under a haze of government rules, regulations and red tape."
"Working families were working too hard for a government that taxed them beyond their means, to pay for more programs and bigger bureaucracies that didn’t meet their needs."
Crime was tearing apart our communities.
Welfare was destroying our families and our children’s hope for a better future.
But New York’s spirit never dies.
"Even in those days, I knew that New Yorkers would emerge from the mist to see their future in our great state through the hopeful eyes of those immigrants in the Harbor."
"And so, today truly is a time for reflection."
"In just three years, we have restored the dream."
We have reduced the size and cost of government.
We have returned power that was for the people back to the people.
We have restored sanctity to the idea that every New Yorker has a sacred right to choose and shape their own destiny.
"We began three years ago with the simple understanding that when government takes too much of the people’s earnings, it limits their freedom, controls their decisions, and puts restrictions on their capacity to fulfill their dreams."
"Consistent with that understanding, three years ago I stood before you and said it was time to return government to its rightful place as the people’s servant, and not their master."
"As a first step in this undertaking, I said it was time to cut income taxes by 25 percent for each and every person in this state."
"And when voices were raised declaring that this government could never afford to give New Yorkers such a dramatic tax cut, we said back then: ""That’s right."
"THIS government -- this big, bloated government -- CANNOT afford to give people a tax cut."
That is why we will create a new government.A smaller government.A smarter government.
A more efficient and effective government.A people’s government.
"In just three years, we have given New Yorkers that smaller, smarter government."
"And in doing so, we have given them that tax cut."
The vast majority of New Yorkers pay state income taxes at rates at least 25 percent lower today than they did in 1994.
"And yes, 450,000 lower income, working New Yorkers now pay no state income taxes at all."
But we didn’t just cut income taxes.
"We cut taxes that most New Yorkers had never even heard of -- consumer taxes that weren’t even called taxes, and today even subway and bus fares are going down for the first time in state history."
We’ve cut so many different taxes -- in so many different ways -- so many times -- it would take me 10 minutes just to read you the list.
"Before we arrived here three years ago, New York led the nation in raising taxes."
"Every year since then, New York has led the nation in cutting taxes."
"In 1996, we cut taxes by more than the other 49 states combined."
"And in 1997, we cut taxes by five times more than Illinois, Texas and California combined."
"By cutting taxes, we have taken a giant step in returning economic power to the people."
"But we didn’t just cut taxes; we cut spending, by creating that smaller, smarter government."
"Because of our fiscal restraint, we ended our first two years with historic budget surpluses."
And this year-- through our fiscal conservatism and strong economic policies -- we will end the year with a surplus even larger than last year’s $1.4 billion surplus.
So let’s cut taxes above and beyond the $500 million I’ve already signed into law for this year.
"In the budget I send you in two weeks, I will propose more than doubling this years tax cuts to $1.2 billion."
Last year we knew it was time to build on the tax cuts of the first two years.
"From this podium, I told you that it was time to cut taxes again.Different taxes.Oppressive taxes.Property taxes."
"For the first time in State history, we have a law -- not an idea, not a plan, not a suggestion, but a law that will cut school property taxes for every homeowner in every community of New York State."
"Under this law, taxpayers in New York will begin to see their property taxes drop by an average of 27 percent."
"That’s a big tax cut, and our people deserve it."
"But knowing, as we do, that school property taxes hurt the elderly especially hard, we wrote the law so our seniors would get an even bigger tax cut, phased in over four years.It’s a great law."
I want to thank you for passing it.I also want you to change it.
"This year, I will propose amending the law so our seniors get the entire tax cut this year."
"Which means that by the end of this year, the average senior citizen in New York will get a school property tax cut of AT LEAST 45-percent.Nearly half!And that’s just the average."
"In 10 of our counties, the average senior citizen will pay no school taxes at all."
"Here’s what that will mean to New Yorkers like the Gongols, a retired couple living in Cattaraugus County."
"Right now, they have a combined income of $18,000."
Six hundred dollars of that income goes toward school property taxes.That’s wrong.They’re in their 80’s.
They’ve paid a lifetime of school property taxes.
Pass this amendment so that they and thousands of other senior citizens will never pay another dime in school property taxes.
On behalf of our seniors I urge you to approve this measure without delay.
"Let this be our way of saying Thank You to the generation of New Yorker’s who preserved America’s freedom in war, lifted our nation and our spirits from the depths of the Depression, and passed on to us, their children, and grandchildren the values of decency and hard work."
We have done well on property taxes.
"But striving to do better has always been our trademark, and it must continue to be."
Relief from property taxes is on its way for all New Yorkers.
But for some New Yorkers--especially New York’s farmers--it can’t come soon enough.
The men and women working on our family farms are -- as Daniel Webster told us -- the founders of civilization.
But farming is more than a proud vestige of our past.
It’s an indispensable part of our future.
Agriculture is New York’s largest industry.
I’m proud of my family’s agricultural roots.
My fondest memories are in the apple orchards of the family farm in Peekskill.
Part of me will always be there.
"For it was there that I learned the simple lessons in life -- lessons about hard work, common decency and truth."
"As Governor, I have maintained a fondness for those roots, and a keen awareness of the problems facing today’s farmers."
"Because a farmer’s livelihood relies on large tracts of land, property taxes hit them disproportionately hard."
"Two weeks from now, I will send you legislation to accelerate property tax relief for New York’s farmers -- so that it takes full effect this year, as well."
We can be proud of all the taxes we’ve cut.
No other state comes even close to cutting taxes the way we have.
New York is the undisputed tax-cutting capital of America.
"When I stood here for the first time three years ago, New York led the nation in violent crime."
"On our streets and in our communities, crime was running rampant and government was doing little to stop it."
The old way of fighting crime was to try to understand the criminal -- to make excuses for his violent behavior by putting much of the blame on society.That’s wrong.
We must never hold a society of good people culpable for the depraved acts of the bad.We know better.
We know that the root cause of violent crime is the violent criminal.
They should not be on our streets.
And that’s what we’ve sought to eliminate.
The laws we’ve passed have put responsibility for crime where it belongs: with the criminal.
Those laws have made the streets of New York safer than they’ve been in decades.
Communities once paralyzed by crime are now emerging from the dark cloud of fear to pursue their dreams in peace.
The drop in our state’s crime rate has been dramatic -- so dramatic that the rest of the nation is looking at New York with awe.
"For the first time in a generation, criminals are running scared and honest New Yorkers are walking our streets with confidence."
We are winning the fight against violent crime.
"In Rochester, violent crime is down 16 percent."
"In Yonkers, it’s down 18 percent."
"Here in our capital, it’s down 18 percent."
"In New York City, it’s down 27 percent."
"And in Buffalo, violent crime is down 34 percent."
"In the last three years, the statewide murder rate has been cut nearly in half, by almost 50 percent.That’s unheard of."
What we’ve done to reduce crime is truly miraculous.
We ended parole for repeat violent felons -- and we saw a profound drop in the state’s violent crime rate.
We ended work release and early release for violent felons and we saw an incredible 87 percent reduction in violent crime by inmates in these programs.
"And yes, we passed a death penalty law, and clearly that law -- and the message it sends to criminals -- has contributed to the unprecedented drop in our state’s murder rate."
We who serve in this capital have many obligations to our people.
"None, however, is more central than promoting safety and saving lives."
"Our achievements in this regard will stand high on the record of time.We can be proud of that.Proud, but not content."
"We lead the nation in fighting crime, but that is not the whole of our mission."
"Our mission is not to stem violent crime, but to eradicate it."
We must eradicate it from every park and playground in every community.
"We must eradicate it from the streets and school yards of our neighborhoods -- from the lives of our people, from the future of our children.That is our mission."
I will send you a package of crime bills that will enable us to take another giant step towards achieving that mission.
"First, we must develop new weapons in the war on drugs."
"To that end, I will propose giving more power to tenants and community organizations to go to court to evict drug dealers."
I will also propose strengthening the law so that those who repeatedly commit misdemeanor drug offenses are subject to a felony conviction.
"And we must stiffen the penalties for the heartless, thoughtless, mindless drug dealers who ply their deadly trade near our parks and playgrounds."
"Second, I ask you to pass the Sexual Assault Reform Act to protect our women and children from violent sexual predators."
"Third, let this be the year that we pass Juvenile Justice Reform."
Let’s send a message to violent criminals of all ages: If you assault our people you will land in prison.
And now is the time to strengthen our states judicial system.
I applaud Chief Judge Kaye for proposing a constitutional amendment to modernize our antiquated system of trial courts.
I urge you to pass that amendment this year.
"Attorney General Dennis Vacco has earned a national reputation, protecting our children from those who would prey on them over the Internet."
"This year, I will propose giving him the legal authority to go to court against convicted violent sexual predators with mental disorders to keep them institutionalized -- away from our children, after serving their criminal sentences."
"And, because crimes rooted in bigotry, antisemitism, hate and intolerance are so destructive to a free society, I will once again ask you to pass Bias Crime legislation."
"Three years ago, I signed a law that sent a strong message to criminals with ruthless minds and blind souls."
That message has been heard and heeded.
The death penalty law has saved lives.
This year I will propose expanding it to save even more lives.
I will propose changing the law to allow for victim impact evidence so juries can hear about the devastation the killer has caused in the lives of family members.
And I will seek to empower our prosecutors by allowing them to expose the complete violent criminal history of convicted murderers at sentencing.
I will propose these and other changes to strengthen -- not just the law -- but New York’s unwavering commitment to saving lives.
"And, it’s time to end parole for all violent felons."
"Two years ago, Maureen Kanka came to these halls to plead for a law, in honor of her daughter, to protect children from convicted child molesters."
"Today, Megan’s Law is New York’s law."
We are joined today by Bruce and Janice Grieshaber.
"Their daughter, Jenna, was a bright, energetic young nursing student at Russell Sage."
Two months ago -- just a few blocks from where we are assembled today -- Jenna was murdered at the hands of a vicious criminal -- a violent felon out on parole.
The parole board didn’t want to release this criminal.They had to.The law required it.
"Last year, I asked you to change this atrocious law -- a law that allows killers to roam our streets."
"Tragically, now the Grieshabers have been drawn into this crusade, and they are directing their energies to ending parole for violent felons.I’m asking you to do the same."
"This year, I will once again send you the legislation to do it."
And for those of you who are charged with carrying out the will of the people -- I urge you to do just that: Carry out the will of the people.Pass this law.Pass Jenna’s Law.End parole for violent felons.
"When I took office, New York State was leading the nation in welfare dependency."
One in every eleven New Yorkers was trapped on welfare.
"In New York City, the problem was even worse: One in every seven residents was collecting welfare."
"One in seven: a shameful, unacceptable number."
"For all too many, New York was not the place of dreams."
It was a place of despair and hopelessness.
"You and I sought to correct the problem by reaffirming the deepest article of our faith -- a faith deeply rooted, not in the institution, but in the individual."
"For we know that no institution of government can match the inherent desire of men and women to dream, to strive and to succeed."
"So we replaced the old pessimism with a new spirit of hope -- a spirit reflected in the words of Moss Hart, who said: ""The only credential New York asked for was the boldness to dream."
"For those who did, New York unlocked its gates and its treasures -- not caring who they were or where they came from."
I want to tell you about the story of a woman from Central New York.
She was on welfare for five years.
"For most of those years, hope was in short supply for her and her three children -- because the welfare system on which she depended was wrongly designed in a way that kept her dependent.You and I changed that."
"We knew that to help people on welfare, we had to tear up the roots of dependency and replace them with the seeds of opportunity."
"We knew that we had to empower local governments, so they could develop creative welfare-to-work programs that would allow people to pull themselves out of government dependency to a life of pride and self reliance."
That’s exactly what this woman and hundreds of thousands of other New Yorkers have done.
She enrolled in Onondaga County’s JOBS Plus program and got the computer skills she needed to land a job.
"Today, she works full-time at Oberdorfer Industries, as a computer operator, where she is carving out new dreams for herself and her children."
"Here’s what she had to say about her job and her new life of independence: ""My children think they’re rich now."
They’re very interested in my work and they ask me how my day was.
I’m showing my children the difference between working and not working.
All you have to have is the motivation to do it.
"Those are the words of Denise Jacobs, who is my special guest today.Mrs. Jacobs, please stand."
I began today’s address by posing a question: What makes New York so great?
I believe the answer is standing in this chamber today.
It is the spirit and the desire to succeed that makes New York great.
It is the determination to overcome that makes New York great.
It is the boldness to dream that makes New York great.
These are the virtues inherent in those New Yorkers who make us most proud.
"And Denise, these are the virtues that I see in you."
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you for being here as a representative of everything that is great about the spirit and the heart of New York."
We have done well in very short period of time.
We took on the welfare system and replaced dependency with opportunity.
"And the result is that we have reduced the welfare rolls by 456,000 people."
"Think about it -- 456,000 people, freed from the bonds of welfare dependency."
New York is a national leader in reducing the welfare rolls.
And like hopeful immigrants steaming into New York Harbor -- they are emerging from the cloud of welfare dependency to a land rich with promise and opportunity.
"And, yes, they are emerging from that system to a strong economy that’s generating an abundance of hope, opportunity and good jobs."
"By the way, that company I mentioned a minute ago -- Oberdorfer Industries, where Denise Jacobs is working -- like thousands of other companies in New York, its growing, expanding, and holding out new opportunities for the people of Syracuse."
"In fact, I was just there in March to announce the creation of 200 new jobs."
When we gathered here three years ago -- seeking to restore our peoples faith in a dream that was eluding them -- it was clear that our first order of business was to get New York’s economy back on its feet.
A job is the most fundamental tool our people rely on to carve out their dreams.
"But three years ago, New York’s jobs were leaving our state in shocking numbers, taking with them the seeds of hope and opportunity that allow dreams to grow."
In just five years -- from 1989 to 1994 -- New York lost a half million jobs.
We didn’t need a commission of academics or bureaucrats to tell us why it was happening.We knew why it was happening.
"Time and again, the men and women in our business community told us why it was happening."
"And whether it was a restaurant owner in Peekskill, a sign maker in Catskill or a CEO in Fishkill, the reasons were always the same: High taxes, excessive regulations, and the outrageous cost of energy, unemployment insurance or worker’s compensation insurance."
So we tackled those problems one by one.
We cut the taxes that were hurting business and killing jobs.
And the result has been more jobs.
We cut the cost of workers comp by an astounding 31 percent.
And the result has been more jobs.
"We cut the Gross Receipts Tax on energy, passed our Power for Jobs Program, and now were moving aggressively towards opening up our energy markets to full competition.Electric rates are going down."
And the result has been more jobs.
Now we must reduce energy rates further so we can create even more jobs.
"In the days to come, I will send you a Securitization bill to make it happen."
We suspended the sales tax on clothes and passed a law to abolish it on clothing under $100 dollars by next year.
And the result was a flurry of new business activity.
"And because the suspension of the sales tax has been such a tremendous success, I’m pleased that you have passed and I will sign a law, so that just ten days from now -- starting on January 17 and ending on the 23rd -- there will be no sales tax on clothing of $500 or less.And, yes, that includes shoes."
"The changes of the past three years are putting New Yorkers back to work, and allowing our people to advance confidently in the direction of their dreams."
"In every corner and every community of our state, jobs and opportunities are springing to life."
"This summer, Pratt Visy opened a new $150 million recycling plant on Staten Island."
It’s the first major manufacturing facility to be built in New York City in over 50 years and its going to create 115 jobs.
Mercedes Benz did an interesting thing recently.
"They spent an enormous amount of time, money and effort to move their Corporate Headquarters."
But they only moved it four miles.
Why would they go to all that trouble just to move four miles?To be in New York.
"They moved that facility from Bergen County, New Jersey to Rockland County, New York."
And that move is expected to pump nearly $112 million into New York’s economy.
"All across the state, New York’s businesses are growing and creating jobs."
"Novartis -- the largest Pharmaceutical Company in the world -- is getting even larger in Suffern, creating 225 new jobs."
"Ingram Micro is growing in leaps and bounds, creating 1,200 new jobs for the people of Williamsville."
"When I was elected, New York was 49th in the nation in creating jobs.Now we are 6th."
"And in 1997, private sector job growth in New York was the best in a decade."
"In just three years, we have helped to create more than 250,000 new private sector jobs."
Each of those jobs is a trail that leads as high into the realm of success and fulfilment as we are willing to venture.
Each is a door that swings open to the kind of life our people have envisioned for themselves and their children.
Each is a reminder that yesterdays job losses have dissipated behind us like a dark cloud passing.
And having walked boldly through it -- we stand face to face with a future of more jobs and opportunity.But we must do more.
Our new Jobs Now program is a great success.
"It’s helping to attract and retain thousands of jobs, particularly in our upstate industrial areas like Utica where ConMed turned an abandoned old plant into a new manufacturing facility."
And in downtown Buffalo where Euro-United is manufacturing lawn furniture.
"That’s why, this year, I will call on you to expand the Jobs Now program."
"Our pro-job tax cutting program is also a success, so I will also call on you to accelerate and expand these job-producing tax cuts this year."
"And, of course, in our never-ending pursuit of creating new jobs for our people, we must keep our eyes firmly fixed on a future that offers a world of untapped opportunities."
The ability to recognize opportunities and the willingness to seize them are the two great engines of progress.
"We are in the throes of the most promising, exciting and rapidly-changing technological age in world history."
"It’s an age that offers limitless opportunities for progress, but only for those ambitious enough to seize them."
We cannot afford to be observers or followers in this high-tech age.
Nor does it fit our character as New Yorkers to assume any role other than a leading one.
"And make no mistake, New York will lead America into the high-tech age of the 21st Century."
"New York was the only state in the nation with the foresight and the vision to abolish the sales tax on Internet services, and in taking that step we’re igniting the flames of progress and technology in Manhattan’s Silicon Alley."
"Here in the Capital District, we’re making historic, high tech investments in our future and in our institutions of higher learning, working with SUNY Albany and RPI to draw a major semiconductor research center that will light up the capital region with an abundance of new high tech jobs."
Fujitsu is the second largest telecommunications company in the world.
"But when it came time to build their new high tech research and development facility, they didn’t build it in the Silicon Valley."
"They built it in the Hudson Valley--in Pearl River, New York."
"And just two months ago, IBM announced its plans to build the world’s most advanced computer chip development facility right here in the Hudson Valley."
It’s the single largest industrial development in the history of our state -- a $700 million project that’s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs.
"Our state’s emergence as the home of high-tech jobs is great news for the people of New York, but it also represents a great challenge."
"As we approach the next Century, companies across the world are going to be building new facilities to manufacture computer chips and other components of the high tech economy."
We must take bold steps to ensure that those facilities are built in New York.
These companies are making decisions and moving at the speed of sound.
To attract them to New York we must move at the speed of light.
"Last year, we began clearing the bureaucratic hurdles that once blocked the road to progress."
"Now, let’s have an open highway of pre-approved sites for chip manufacturing plants, so when a high-tech company is looking for a place to build a plant, New York is ready to put the shovel in the ground."
This year I will propose building on our vision for the 21st Century by making the entire state of New York a High Tech Development Corridor.
"Working with local governments, we will look to have them propose sites ranging from individual buildings to business districts to entire valleys where we can get pre-approval of zoning, building and environmental permits."
"So that when a company is looking to build or relocate, they can come to New York and be in the ground or up and running in a matter of weeks."
We stand two years before the dawning of a new century.
We must commit ourselves to seizing every opportunity the high tech age presents us.
We must be bolder that ever in fulfilling that vision.
"So when our chapter in history is written, the first words of that chapter will be: It was the great state of New York that led the nation and the world into the 21st Century."
"In just three years, we have taken bold and aggressive steps to give New Yorkers the best health care in America."
"New Yorkers who participate in managed care now are protected by the strongest, most sweeping ""Bill of Rights"" in the nation."
New families are now given a healthy start because you and I did the right thing and passed the 48-hour Maternity Bill.
"And women facing the agonizing prospect of breast cancer now have new rights, because you and I wrote the law to ensure they receive the medical care and emotional support they deserve."
"We funded mobile mammography vans, bringing breast cancer screening services to rural and under-served areas across the state."
"And as I speak, we’re implementing the pesticide registry bill to advance our aggressive fight against breast cancer."
"And on this note, I want to acknowledge the important work being done by a very special person in this chamber today."
"Libby, I know how deeply personal this issue is for you."
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you for your tireless efforts to transform pain into progress in the area of breast cancer."
"In just three years, we have made the Child Health Plus program a national model for insuring our young people."
"Last year alone, we expanded the program dramatically, increasing the number of children covered under the program from 100,000 to 250,000 kids."
"But we didn’t just expand the program, we improved it by providing those children with in-hospital health care for the first time ever.But we can do better."
No child should be denied medical care.
"Today, on behalf of New York’s most precious resource, its children, I ask you to join me in taking the next step -- perhaps the boldest step we’ve ever taken in the area of health care."
"In the next few weeks, I will send you legislation guaranteeing access to comprehensive health coverage for every single child of New York through the age of 18."
Nothing in our future holds more promise than the vivid dreams of a child.
"And no obligation is more fundamental -- for us, as parents -- than the obligation to give them a clear path to those dreams."
We have made tremendous strides.
Last year we committed more money than ever before to education.
"And in doing so we have laid the groundwork for a brighter, more promising and enlightened future for the children of New York."
"This year, we must reinforce last years increased funding with bold, sweeping, fundamental, common sense change."
We’re continuing to increase funding for new books and computers.
"We’re continuing the task of limiting class size to 20, and I applaud you for that."
"Now, lets tackle the real-life problems that we know are preventing our children from learning."
Let’s begin by giving our children a head start on their education.
"For years, the state’s Pre-K programs have been classified as experimental."
Let’s declare the experiment over.
"Let’s declare, once and for all, what we all know to be the case: Pre-K works."
"In the months ahead, we will begin to offer pre-K funding statewide."
"By the year 2001, we will increase funding for Pre-K to roughly ten times the current amount.Our children want to learn.They want to do well.They want to succeed."
On report card day they want to walk through the door of their home and make their parents proud.
"Let’s help them reach their dreams, and our dreams for them."
"Let’s make the changes that need to be made so we can have a state filled with proud parents and bright, well educated children."
"In the coming days, I will send you a package of bills to make it happen."
"First, we must ensure that if our children need extra help learning to read, they get it early -- before it’s too late."
To advance a child who cannot read hurts the child and dooms them to failure.
"At the end of the next school year, all fourth graders will be given tests to gauge their reading skills."
It’s a great idea and I applaud the Board of Regents for making it happen.
But we must do more at this critical point in a child’s development.
"If these tests show that a child needs extra help, we must give it to them."
"This year, I will propose giving local school districts the option of offering a special six-week class in the summer for 4th graders who need that extra help."
I began today with a story about immigrants emerging from the fog of New York Harbor to the land of dreams.
"I believe we have an obligation to the courageous men, women and children who come to this state, seeking great things for themselves and their children."
Perhaps the most fundamental obligation we have in that regard is to ensure that every child in New York has the opportunity to become fluent in English.
"When he went to the first grade -- in Peekskill, New York -- my father couldn’t speak a word of English.Nor could his parents."
"It was the schools that taught him English, giving him the opportunity to lead a proud and productive life that included being able to see his son become the Governor of New York."
"This year, I will propose a pilot program -- the English Immersion Program -- that will allow local school districts to provide our children, in their earliest school years, with the opportunity to take intensive English classes in school over the summer months."
Let’s give these families the same opportunity that New York gave my father.
And let this be the year that we separate students who behave from those who refuse to behave; the ones who are committed to success from the ones whose actions prevent success.
"If we are to rid our schools of violence, we must give our teachers the authority to remove those who engage in it."
"In the weeks to come, I will once again send you legislation giving them that authority."
"On behalf of the children who want to learn, I urge you to pass it."
And this session let’s enact a statewide pilot program of Advantage Schools which will give local school districts the option of keeping schools open until 7 o’clock in the evening.
"Advantage Schools will allow our new Office of Children and Family Services to work with our schools to provide children with a secure, structured environment, where they can take part in a range of activities, from getting extra help in math to learning how to use the Internet."
It will give parents the freedom to pick up their children after work.
And it gives us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our anti-drug education efforts.
"On behalf of our children, I ask you to support the creation of Advantage Schools in New York."
"This session, we must reform our special education system."
We must separate children with genuine learning disabilities from children who simply won’t behave.
Let’s eliminate the fiscal incentives that encourage districts to inappropriately place children with behavioral problems into special education.
We must never stop seeking creative new ways to improve the performance of our schools.
"I believe there are a wellspring of fresh ideas out there, and I believe they can be discovered in the creation of Charter Schools."
"As you know, Charter Schools operate outside of the traditional public school structure, which frees them from the bureaucratic mandates that too often stifle the innovative spirit."
We cannot afford to shy away from exploring new ground.
"If we do, we run the risk of missing out on great opportunities for our children."
"On their behalf, I strongly urge you to give charter schools a chance."
On behalf of our children -- whose future depends on our willingness to make sound decisions about their education -- I urge you to approve these measures so our children have every tool they need to build up the empires in their minds -- and walk proudly into a future where the only limits on their success is their capacity to dream.
"Five decades ago, Governor Dewey noted that -- quote -- ""It must be our prime objective to maintain and improve the unexcelled standards of education of which our people are so proud."
"On this, the 50th anniversary of the SUNY System he created, we have every right to be proud."
"At Stony Brook, astronomers have discovered six new galaxies -- the most distant objects ever observed by the human eye."
"At Binghamton, researchers are finding new ways to make the fastest supercomputers known to man even faster -- at a fraction of the original cost."
"At Alfred, they’ve discovered a compound that could render painful bone surgeries obsolete."
This year we must seek out new and creative ways of advancing the mission of SUNY and CUNY.
"Within weeks, I will be sending you a bold new initiative that will pump new life, ideas and energy into our SUNY and CUNY systems and make them stronger than ever for the children of the 21st Century."
"Although the previous administration abolished Merit Scholarships, you and I held firm to the conviction that rewarding hard work and excellence is the right message to send to our children."
So we restored Scholarships for Academic Excellence for the children of New York.
"And in doing so, we’re not only rewarding hard work, but promoting higher education in New York by providing incentives for the best and the brightest students to attend college here."
"For these reasons, the budget I submit this month will more than double the number of students eligible to receive Scholarships for Academic Excellence, while also raising the maximum scholarship award our best and brightest students can obtain."
"By investing in the next generation, we are making the best investment we can in our future."
There is little doubt that New York’s history books will record 1997 as the most important year for land preservation in over a century.
They say a picture is worth a thousand words -- but I’ve climbed to the peak of Black Mountain and I can tell you that no words exist to describe the natural wonder of the Adirondack Mountains.
I am proud of what we’ve done to ensure that our children and their children will inherit their beauty.
"Because of an historic agreement reached last month, New York will own the Whitney Estate -- 15,000 acres of pure green and blue wilderness -- including the largest privately owned lake east of the Mississippi."
"Later this year, this beautiful piece of land will be open to the public for the first time in over a century."
"We will soon complete the purchase of Sterling Forest, a magnificent 15,000-acre forest and watershed in Orange County that will become a wonderful public resource for millions of New Yorkers."
"And, yes, we’re moving aggressively to put the Environmental Bond Act to work for our people in a way thats going to dramatically improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers."
We’re closing polluting landfills like the Troy Landfill and the Rush Landfill in Monroe County.
We’re improving the quality of our air by replacing old diesel buses with modern clean fuel buses.
"We’re providing communities with cleaner, healthier drinking water by improving water treatment plants -- from Brentwood and Buffalo to Endicott and Elmira."
We’re cleaning up contaminated industrial sites like the East Rome Industrial Park and the Apco site in Rochester and turning them into economic opportunities.
"We’re protecting precious rivers and lakes, and we will begin the clean up of Onondaga Lake and Long Island Sound."
"And yes, we finalized the historic agreement to protect New York City’s watershed, and the drinking water of nine million New Yorkers."
"Three years ago, we committed ourselves to a cleaner, greener and healthier New York."
And in doing so we have ended the sad legacy of environmental neglect we inherited and replaced it with a new strength: Today New York leads the nation in environmental preservation.
"This year, we must build on that commitment in a way that continues to foster economic growth and opportunity."
But we must also launch an aggressive new effort to preserve New York’s treasures.
Let’s renovate the crumbling visitor facilities at Niagara Falls and make it the great national tourist attraction that it should be.
Let’s restore the beauty of the Erie Canal corridor and let’s renovate the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid so the only town in America to ever host the Winter Games twice can continue to host international competitions and carry on it’s proud Olympic legacy.
And let’s turn years of procrastination into action.
"This year, we will break ground on the first phase of the Hudson River Park, transforming an abandoned waterfront of old piers into a safe and beautiful natural resource for the families of New York."
"We must preserve these and all of New York’s treasures for ourselves, our children and our posterity."
We began today by reflecting on our fortunes as New Yorkers -- which is really a reflection on ourselves.
For it is the character of our people that makes New York special.
"Yes, it’s a character seen in the lives of New Yorkers like Teddy Roosevelt and Susan B. Anthony, whose boldness to dream changed the course of history."
"But most often, you see it in the lives of ordinary men and women, who seek neither fame nor fortune nor power -- merely the opportunity to let their imaginations run free in a land where dreams can come true, knowing that if they are bold enough to wish for it, and determined enough to work for it, nothing can stand in their way."
"For a time, government stood in their way."
Our future then was like hope gleaming through an era of twilight.
"Three years later, New York stands at the dawn of its greatest day."
"Like those hopeful souls in the harbor -- yearning to breathe free -- we have emerged from the mist to the endless, enduring dream."
And we are sailing toward our destiny which lies before us like a land of limitless opportunity.Thank you and God Bless.
