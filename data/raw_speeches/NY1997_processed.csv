SENTENCES
"Chief Judge Kaye, honorable members of the Court of Appeals, Lieutenant Governor McCaughey Ross, Comptroller McCall, Majority Leader Bruno, Speaker Silver, Leader Reynolds, Leader Connor, respected members of the Legislature, and distinguished guests."
Attorney General Dennis Vacco is in Washington today arguing a case before the United States Supreme Court.
I wish him well as he represents the people of our state in the nation's highest court.
"As I look out in this chamber, I see a lot of old friends and feel the memories rush by."
"Sadly, as I look around, I no longer see Assemblywoman Eileen Dugan or Assemblyman Phil Healy."
"All of us, I'm sure, have fond memories of their days and years in this room and in this city."
"Let us pause for a moment to reflect on those days, their work, their lives and the energy and passion they brought to this chamber."
"But it is heartening to see someone here again, for his 50th straight session."
"Gus Bliven, congratulations on this remarkable achievement, and best wishes for the next 50 years."
"And I am heartened today to see an old friend in a familiar place, but in a new capacity."
"I want to welcome back to this chamber Richard Wesley, not as an Assemblyman, but as a judge of the court of appeals."
"Judge , we wish you a successful and productive term."
"And allow me to recognize two members of my family who mean the world to me --my wife, Libby, and my mother, Peggy."
"Exactly two centuries ago, in 1797, Albany became the Capital of the greatest state in the nation."
"Fourteen years earlier, George Washington came to New York and stood in awe."
He predicted that this state--our state--was destined for greatness.
"Using the turn of the century to shape the tone of the future, those who met here for the first time in 1797 set out to fulfill that prophecy."
"Today, two hundred years later, we stand at the edge of a new era, a new century and a new millennium."
There is only one way to enter this new era.
"We must go roaring into the next century--bold, confident and determined--accepting every challenge that comes before us."
"When future generations look back at this period in our state's history, they will recall these as the years when hope prevailed over fear, when confidence prevailed over cynicism, when freedom prevailed over bureaucracy."
They will know these as the years when the Empire State--led by the irrepressible spirit of its people-- roared back to life and laid the foundation for a brighter future.
The past two years have prepared us well for our passage into the 21st Century.
A great shift of power has taken place--from the government back to the people.
"And because this historic transfer of power has taken place, the future of our state is in good hands."
It is in the hands of the people.
"Today we have a government that knows its mission, knows its limits and knows its master."
"Today we have a government that reports to the people, instead of a people who report to government."
"Today, our state leads the nation in areas where--just two short years ago--we were dead last."
"Just two years ago, New York led the nation for having the highest tax burden of any state on its people."
"Today, we lead the nation in cutting taxes."
"Just two years ago, New York led the nation in welfare dependency."
"Today, we lead the nation in moving people from welfare to hope and opportunity."
"Just two years ago, New York led the nation in job-killing worker's comp rates."
"Today, we lead the nation in reducing those rates."
"Just two years ago, New York's level of violent crime was unconscionable."
"Today, we lead the nation in reducing violent crime."
"And just two years ago, New York lacked the resources to clean up our air and water."
"Today, we lead the nation in our commitment to a cleaner, greener state."
"In each case, things which used to hold our state back are now propelling it forward."
"Today, state government serves the people better because it's smaller, less expensive and more efficient than it's been in decades."
"Today, violent crime is dropping and our streets are becoming safer."
"Today, more New Yorkers are working and supporting a family."
"Today, fewer New Yorkers are trapped on welfare."
"Today, taxes are at their lowest level in decades."
"Together, we have laid the groundwork for a future filled with new opportunities, new achievements and a new sense of confidence."
"We must move to this brighter future with a unified, bi-partisan voice."
"Not as Democrats or Republicans, but as New Yorkers."
"New Yorkers who are proud to live in a state that is roaring back to life with new vigor, new ideas, and new ambition."
"Last year, you and I passed comprehensive, historic health care reform."
"We ended an archaic system, and gave poor and elderly New Yorkers better access to primary and preventive care."
"We wrote the most comprehensive ""Bill of Rights"" in the nation for patients in managed care programs to guarantee that their health is the most important concern."
"We doubled the number of children in the Child Health Plus program, giving 250,000 uninsured children access to the finest health care in the world."
"And we ensured that new mothers and their infants would be able to rest safely in a hospital, instead of being rushed home by unfair insurance practices."
The people who are benefitting from this legislation do not care whether it was written by Democrats or Republicans.
What matters to them is that they have access to better health care for themselves and their children.
This year we must build on those successes.
Treatment decisions must be made based on what's best for the patient.
A mastectomy is a traumatic and emotional procedure.
"As with childbirth, the decision about how long a woman stays in the hospital following a mastectomy is one which should be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor."
"This session, we must pass legislation giving women that right."
"The program I outline today will continue to promote personal growth, personal freedom and personal responsibility."
"It is, after all, these qualities that make a people great."
We will continue to put economic power where it belongs: in the hands of the people.
"For it is the people of New York--not its government, but the people--who have children to raise, families to support and dreams to pursue."
"It is the people--not government--who yearn, strive, and endeavor."
It is the people who make the effort and take the risks.
It is the people who should reap the rewards.
"The past two years have shown what we always knew to be true: That by cutting taxes and returning economic power to the people, we can create a stronger economy that produces more new jobs.And that's what we did."
We promised to cut taxes in 1995.We did.
We promised to cut taxes in 1996.We did.
We promised to cut taxes this year.
"We've not only done that, we did it three months early."
"Just seven days ago, the third phase of our three year income tax cut became law."
"This week, New Yorkers--your constituents and mine--will open a paycheck that is bigger than it was the week before."
"On their pay stub is a box marked ""state tax."
It is the amount of money state government takes from its people.
"This year, last year and the year before that, we returned more of that money to the families who earned it."
"This year, we are returning nearly $4 billion to New York families."
"By the end of this year, these same families will have saved $6.5 billion that used to go to government."
Families can use that money to buy clothes for their children.A new television.A set of encyclopedias.Whatever they choose.
Whatever they decide will help them build a better life for themselves and their children.
"By letting New Yorkers keep more of the money they've earned, we have done what is right."
We have done what is right for the people.
We have done what it right for the economy.
We have done what is right under the basic principles of a free society.
Two years of tax cuts have created a growing economy that has strengthened families and produced tens of thousands of new jobs.
"As good as that is, we have only begun to create jobs, because we have only begun to cut taxes.We must do more."
Property taxes in New York State are too high.Way too high.
"Homeowners pay too much, and get too little in return."
It's time to reduce their property taxes.
"Senator Bruno, Senator Cook and others have been outspoken on this issue.And they are right."
"The budget plan I will release next week will begin a multi-year program to stop the continual increases in school taxes, reverse that trend and actually begin to lower these taxes for every homeowner in every town, every village and every city of New York State--from Buffalo to Brooklyn to Babylon."
And we will do this while enhancing our commitment to quality education.
"When our school property tax plan is fully implemented, it's going to put hundreds of millions of dollars back where they belong--in the pockets of New York's families."
"Combined with the state income tax cuts, New Yorkers will again see their tax burden drop by more than residents of any other state."
"So instead of encyclopedias, maybe a New York family will opt for a home computer with an Internet hook-up and get the encyclopedias on CD-ROM."
"Again, the choice should belong to the people, not government."
"Because the money belongs to the people, not government."
"And to our senior citizens, I say this: Thank you for all that you have done for this state."
"You have lived in New York, worked in New York, paid taxes in New York, raised families in New York."
You have invested so much time and effort in this state.
"But, now, too much of your fixed income goes to government."
"Under the property tax plan I will release next week, the average senior citizen homeowner in New York State will--over a period of time--see their school property taxes reduced by almost half."
"That's a significant savings for anyone, especially for people living on a fixed income."
We have shown that it can be done.
"By replacing big government with smart government, we've cut state income taxes."
Now we must reinforce our commitment to taxpayers by providing real school property tax relief.
"By cutting taxes, reforming workers comp and eliminating destructive regulations we have helped to create a stronger economic climate that produces new jobs for our people."
"Each of these jobs holds out new challenges, new hope and new opportunity for a family in Niagara Falls, Newburgh or New Rochelle."
"After more than a decade of taxing and regulating jobs out of our state, New York is truly changing its ways."
"In the 21st Century, I see a New York that's alive again with the bold spirit that inspired a bank clerk named Eastman, from Rochester, to revolutionize the world through the magic of photography at the turn of the last century."
"In the 21st Century, I see a New York that attracts the best and the brightest."
"In the 21st Century, I see a New York where businesses and employees move onward to a brighter future in a state that shuns no challenge, accepts no excuses and sets no limits."
"In the 21st Century, I see a New York where commerce is robust and jobs are plentiful."
It's a New York where every family and every child is fortified with the sense of hope and opportunity that comes from an invigorated economy that produces good jobs.I see that New York.You see that New York.
And the people of New York see it too.
Let us work together to continue making that vision a reality.
"Two years ago, a company called Maines Paper in Binghamton was ready to give up on our state--ready to leave behind the high taxes, the oppressive regulations, and the crippling cost of doing business in New York."
It would have meant the loss of 800 jobs in New York.
"It would have meant hardship for 800 families directly, and hundreds of other families indirectly.But it didn't happen."
We changed the policies that were driving jobs and opportunities out of our state.
We cut 10 job-crushing taxes on businesses.
We reformed the worker's compensation system so employers would have more money to invest in new jobs.
And we got rid of hundreds of destructive regulations that prevented companies from growing jobs.
"Because of these changes, Maines is staying in our state."
"And last March, Maines announced that it will add 100 new jobs."
Bill Stewart is a truck driver at Maines.
He's one of the 800 employees whose job is now securely planted in New York State.
He talked about not having to worry anymore about selling his home.
And he talked about how relieved he was that his family wouldn't have to go through the distress and uncertainty of losing a job.
"Today, Bill Stewart has the comfort and peace of mind that flows freely in an economy that's becoming vibrant, robust and alive."
"It's an economy where jobs flourish, families prosper and all New Yorkers wake to the promise of a new day filled with new challenges and endless opportunity."
You and I can be proud of this state's economic renewal and the jobs it's creating --from one end of New York to the other.
"In Tonawanda, GM Powertrain is growing and creating 350 new jobs."
"Thirty miles north in Niagara Falls, TeleTech Holdings is hiring a thousand new people."
It's the largest influx of new jobs to that area in nearly a century.
"In Manhattan's Twin Towers, more than 600 New Yorkers are starting new jobs at Fidelity Investments."
"On Long Island, 275 New Yorkers have new jobs with Nature's Bounty."
And I'm sure most of you have heard of a leading retailer called Nine West.
But you probably don't know the origin of the name.
It comes from Nine West 57th Street.
That's where two visionaries began pursuing their dream.It's where Nine West was born.
"But, sadly, Nine West left our state in the 80's."
"Today, Nine West is based in Connecticut and Ohio.But not for long."
"This year, the company saw that the lights of opportunity are once again shining bright in the Empire State."
"And they've decided to move their Ohio and Connecticut offices--not to Texas, not to Georgia--but to White Plains, New York."
"For New Yorkers, it means 1,200 new jobs."
And let me tell you about a company called Harden Furniture.
"When they began making furniture in the Mohawk Valley, Abe Lincoln was a junior lawyer and John Tyler was President."
It's the oldest family-owned furniture making company in our state.
The company survived the economic hardships of the civil war. .
Survived the factory closings of World War I. .Survived the Great Depression.
But recently the company felt it couldn't survive the high cost of doing business in New York State.
"In 1987, after 143 years in the Mohawk Valley, Harden decided to expand."
"Not in New York, but in North Carolina."
"This year, Harden announced the creation of forty new jobs."
"Not in North Carolina, but here in New York."
Harden is closing its plant in North Carolina and bringing those jobs back to our state.
Because they know that NewYork is home--not just to their past--but to their future.
To the 545 employees of Harden Furniture: Congratulations.
This state will not fail you again.
Every new job in our state is a human success story in the making.
Each is a family empowered by financial stability.
"Each is a road that leads to new challenges, new opportunities and new chances for personal greatness."
Tens of thousands of new jobs is a great start.
"But it is, in fact, just a start.Lower taxes.Smarter government.Fewer regulations."
Lower workers compensation rates.
"With these historic reforms, our people have embarked on a path that leads to greater opportunity for all New Yorkers."
Now that path must be widened to include reduced energy rates so we can build on these reforms and create even more opportunity for our people.
"For too long, energy monopolies have had a dual effect on our people and businesses--high costs, and lost jobs."
We are working with the Public Service Commission to bring competition to the electric marketplace.
We have lowered the gross receipts tax on utility bills.
"But we must do more, including passing legislation that will save consumers hundreds of millions of dollars."
"With your support, we can light up every home and every business with affordable energy."
This is doubly important on Long Island.
"For too long, Long Islanders have suffered under unfair electric rates--the highest in the continental United States."
We cannot--and we will not--rest until the people and businesses of Long Island get the double-digit rate relief they deserve.
I am confident that by working together in a spirit of bi-partisan cooperation we can achieve those rate reductions.
"Reducing the cost of energy across New York State will build on the progress of the past year, and help to sustain it for the children of the 21st Century."
Opening the doors of opportunity to our children is not enough.
We must prepare them to walk through those doors.
"Our future--its promise, its purpose, its potential--is in our schools."
It is in the minds of our children.
"And yes, it's in our ability to educate and enlighten those young and fruitful minds, and give them the tools they need to unleash every bit of their limitless potential."
"Just three weeks ago, you and I passed the most significant and meaningful school reform that the New York City School System has seen in decades."
"After years of rhetoric, we delivered results."
We have restored accountability to a school system that had little.
We have replaced a system that benefitted bureaucrats with a system that's going to benefit children.
And we have planted the seeds for a new era in New York City schools where the emphasis is where it belongs: on children.
"And this year, together, we returned merit scholarships to every high school in our state so that our best students can attend college right here in New York."
But education is not just about money or teachers or school boards or budgets.
"It's about children, their ambitions, and New York's future, Let that be the principle in every school in every community of our state."
"Our children, and their education, must take precedence over everything else."
"This year, we must continue to ensure that money and resources are targeted to the classroom, targeted to students, targeted to learning."
"If the children of our state are to meet the challenges of the future, we must give them tangible tools for learning, such as computers."
The Internet is a gateway to vast information.It has maps.Newspapers.Books.Articles.
It has the Declaration of Independence.The Constitution.The Emancipation Proclamation.It has portraits of Lincoln.Portraits of Kennedy.Even portraits of some of you.
"It's the window to a world of information--new information, updated minute by minute."
Its potential for cultivating bright minds and great thinkers is limited only by the curiosity and imagination of our children.
The Internet is a powerful and promising tool.Let's not wait.
Let's put this tool in the hands of our children.
"Through the Wired For Education program, last year we gave more than 3,000 schools in New York State the wiring they need to log on to the Internet."
Making this happen was a mammoth undertaking.
"Like all endeavors of virtue, it brought out the best in our people."
It involved business and labor.
School teachers and school boards.Parents and principals.
"Superintendents, cable television stations and newspaper publishers."
It involved the New York State Board of Regents and the New York State United Teachers.
So many were instrumental in wiring the schools.
AT&T contributed and is now helping schools get on line.
"State Technologies, a small firm here in Albany, organized the entire effort, and they deserve our deepest thanks."
"But the spirit behind New York Wired for Education is best exemplified by the members of a group called the Telephone Pioneers of America, a group of retired telephone workers."
"On wiring day, they were out in force -- making this high technology barn-raising a success."
"Now, we must build on this partnership."
"We've given schools the wiring, now let's get them the computers they need."
The budget I present will begin our multi-year commitment that will triple the money the state gives local schools to buy computers.
"With private help, labor and volunteer support, let's pledge today that between now and the turn of the century, we will have a computer available for every student in every school. . And that every student will know how to tap into its limitless resources."
Investing in computers is a giant step towards giving our children the tools they'll need in the 21st Century.But we must do more than that.
"As we move forward with giving our children the tools of the future, we must ensure that the tools of today are the best they can be."
"Sadly, in some classrooms of our state, the textbooks are older than the children reading them."
"In many schools, dedicated teachers have paid for new books for their students out of their own pockets."
It is a tribute to the caliber of the professionals who teach our children.
But this sacrifice should not be necessary.And it must change.
Our children should not be studying old science or reading about Communists in power in Leningrad as a current event.
"Instead, children should be reading about the end of the cold war; the fall of the Berlin Wall; and the collapse of Apartheid."
The budget I will submit next week will begin New York on the road to a doubling of the money this state provides schools for new textbooks for our children.
"And let me be clear: That money will be used--not for textbooks AND administration, not for textbooks AND programs--but for textbooks and textbooks alone."
"Overall, I will propose that this year, we increase our financial support to our schools by more than a quarter billion dollars."
"But we must make it clear that we are increasing funding for children, and their education, not for bureaucracy."
"Just as together we have created more efficient and effective state government--a smarter state government--our schools must begin to provide smarter, more efficient and effective education."
"This year, we will provide incentives for districts that follow the state's lead in reducing wasteful spending, and reward those districts that eliminate unnecessary administrative costs and concentrate their spending on children."
And a smarter school system must instill in our children a smart message: that experimenting with drugs is wrong.Dead wrong.
"All of the promise, all of the knowledge, and all of the potential that exists in the minds of our children can be wiped out in an instant by drugs."
"Each of us--parents, teachers, elected leaders--must redouble our efforts to teach our children that staying away from drugs is the only way to build a bright and happy future where dreams come true."
The generation that will lead New York through the 21st Century will inherit a state and an economy that is rich with promise and opportunity.
"With the tools of the future in their hands, our children can meet any challenge, soar to any height, and fly as high as their strength and ability will take them."
That era of hope extends to all New Yorkers including those that for too long have been trapped in a system called welfare.These are New Yorkers.Bright talented New Yorkers.
They have a right to share in our state's historic renewal.
"In less than two years, we've reduced the welfare rolls by over 250,000."
It's as if we took Shea Stadium.Rich Stadium.Yankee Stadium.the Carrier Dome.Madison Square Garden.and filled them to capacity.
then gave each of these New Yorkers a better life and a brighter future.
That's quite an accomplishment.
This year we have an historic opportunity to do more.
"This year we must put more people to work, and continue replacing a system of dependency with a system of hope."
"We must rise to this challenge, not because federal law requires it, but out of compassion for the more than one million New Yorkers who are still locked in a system that prevents them from succeeding."
The welfare reform plan that I submitted to you--and that awaits your action--will give people on welfare the fullness of hope and opportunity that comes from getting out from underneath the scourge of government dependency.
It's a plan to replace welfare checks with pay checks.
It's a plan to make able-bodied people on welfare active and productive members of society.
"As part of our New York Works plan, we will give welfare recipients the skills they need to get a job."
"Today I ask each of you to join me, trade unions and local governments in the creation of a new initiative called ""Built on Pride."
"In cities across the state, there are foreclosed properties, boarded up homes and abandoned apartments--all in dire need of repairs."
"With the talented men and women of the building trades--with labor, business, local and state governments -- with all of us working together--we can create a program that uses these sites to teach able-bodied welfare recipients skills like painting, carpentry, drywalling, plumbing, and electrical work."
"On site training in the ""Built on Pride"" program will give people the skills they need to land a job when they transition off welfare."
It will give them the skills and opportunity to become the contractors who help rebuild our state in the 21st century.
"And in the process, our cities will benefit from having run-down properties renovated, so they can be occupied and returned to the tax rolls."
The welfare system has caused despair where there could and should be prosperity.
"It has divided our state into two very distinct and separate societies--those who are free to pursue and follow opportunities, and those who are denied even the chance."
"There are hundreds of thousands of bright, talented, capable New Yorkers trapped on the wrong side of freedom."
"Yes, the welfare system we are presiding over today is democracy's Berlin Wall."
"On one side is bleakness, despair and the cold hand of government."
"On the other side is freedom, energized by the human spirit and the bright light of opportunity."
"Today, on behalf of those who are trapped, I ask for your support.Let's tear down this wall.New York is a state of heroes."
"We find them everywhere, in every walk of life.They're in our schools.On our streets.In our hospitals.On our farms.At the dinner table."
"Last summer, I saw heroes off the coast of Long Island, at the site of an awful, heartbreaking tragedy."
"The crash of TWA Flight 800 left 230 families searching for answers, comfort and strength."
Hundreds of rescue workers were there to give it to them.
Among them were 48 divers from the New York State Police.
"Together, they made 646 dives into the dark waters, recovering victims, wreckage, and personal belongings."
"More than 120 feet below the sea, they faced a dangerous web of wires, cables and twisted metal."
But perhaps the truest measure of their heroism was their personal strength in the face of such a terrible human tragedy.
"We often forget that behind the badges and the uniforms are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers."
"They are not immune to fear, to sadness or despair."
They bear it for those they are sworn to serve.
"Through their work, they carry the burden of countless tragedies."
"Day in and day out, they are beacons of strength and hope in our darkest hours."
Three of our state police divers are in this chamber.
"They are here today representing those troopers, as well as the thousands of other heroes from Long Island, New York City and across this state who took part in the recovery effort."
"Words cannot adequately express it, but I'm sure I speak for all New Yorkers today."
"Thank you--all of you--for the difficult work you do, and the tremendous sacrifice you make on our behalf."
"Troopers Beth Burchill, Nelson Saldana and Paul Antonovich.please stand."
You represent everything that is great about the character of this state and its people.I applaud you.
The spirit of hope and renewal that is sweeping through our communities is a powerful force.
It is driven by the determination of a people and a state that are roaring into the future with a renewed sense of optimism and hope.
Crime is no match for that force--no match for the spirit that is driving our state's renewal.
"Together, you and I are turning the tables on fear and putting it back where it belongs: in the hearts of criminals."
The proof is in our communities.In our neighborhoods.And on our streets.
Listen to what's happened over the past two years.
Violent crime is down 23-percent.
That's the largest decrease on record.Assaults are down 22-percent.
"That, too, is the largest decrease on record.Robberies are down 24-percent."
Murders are down by almost a third.
"And in New York City, safety is winning in a city once consumed with fear."
"I want to commend Mayor Giuliani, the New York City Council and the New York City Police Department for the bold and courageous steps they've taken to reduce crime and enhance the image of the greatest city in the world."
What Rudy Giuliani has done is truly remarkable and worthy of our praise and support.
"But, as promising as the news is, we must do more to drive crime and violence from our streets."
"As we roar into the new millennium, we can have a state where children, parents and grandparents walk safe, secure and confident in their neighborhoods."
We can have a state where parks are safe havens for grandparents playing with their grandchildren.
where streets once corrupted by dealers pushing drugs are replaced with parents pushing strollers.
where every neighborhood is safe and alive with the carefree sounds of childrens' laughter.
We can have that kind of New York.
But only if we continue to pass laws that deter criminal behavior and root out those who will not be deterred.
"Two years ago, we ended parole for repeat violent felons."
This year we must end parole for all violent felons.
"Dangerous criminals belong in our prisons, not on our streets."
"Last year, we passed a law so that juvenile felons will now be fingerprinted."
This year we must continue to attack juvenile crime.
Victims do not suffer any less when their assailant is young.
Our laws must protect people from criminals of all ages.
The sentence imposed on the criminal must reflect the suffering imposed on the victim.
"I was very encouraged, Speaker Silver, to hear your recent comments about the need to crack down on violent juvenile crime."
"And with your support, and the ongoing support of Senator Bruno and the State Senate, this will be the year that we reform the juvenile criminal justice system in New York State."
And let this also be the year that we reform the search and seizure laws that give criminals an unfair advantage over police and prosecutors.
"Former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo once lamented that: ""Criminals go free because the constable blundered."
"In New York, the constable doesn't even have to blunder for the criminal to go free."
There are countless examples that illustrate this fact.
"Let me give you one: A few years back, a van was stopped for speeding at two O'clock in the morning by State Troopers."
"It was the second day of deer season, and the Troopers had a hunch that there might be illegal game in the vehicle."
They asked if they could take a look.The driver agreed.
"As it turns out, the trooper's hunch was wrong."
There wasn't a dead deer in the van; there was a dead person.
The man confessed to the murder.
"And warrants obtained to search his apartment produced 11 pounds of cocaine, 3 loaded weapons, and the cellophane that was used to wrap the victim's body."
"Needless to say, the man was convicted and went to prison.Case closed?Not in New York."
"Last year, an Appellate Court overturned the conviction and ruled that all of the evidence, the dead body, the confession, the drugs, the guns, the blood sample, were inadmissable in court."
The court came to the following conclusion.
The officers had no right to ask the murderer if they could look in the back of his van.
The fact that their request was non-threatening and his compliance was voluntary was deemed irrelevant.This is unacceptable.
Ours is the only state in America where the search and seizure laws are applied like this.
You have the authority to change it.
You must exercise that authority.
We are too great a state to have laws that help criminals plot their escape from justice.
"I urge each and every one of you to pass the Police and Public Protection Act, so we can restore common sense and sanity to our search and seizure laws."
And we must also strengthen our law relating to sexual assault.
"Last week, parents across the state for the first time received information about convicted sex offenders in their communities."
Megan's Law became New York's law.We must do more.
We must enact legislation that mandates a life sentence for anyone convicted twice for the sexual abuse of a child.Two strikes and you're out.
And we must change our evidence laws so that juries can learn about a defendant's prior sex crimes in any sex assault prosecution.
We must allow the victims of sexual assault to learn if their attackers are HIV positive so they can make informed decisions about their own health.
And we must expand the crimes covered by the DNA database law --the database that the state Police are now constructing and that promises to be the greatest crime-solving tool of the 21st Century.
"This session, I will introduce an Omnibus Sexual Assault Law that will include these important measures and others to protect women and children from those who would prey upon them."
That law must also be New York's Law.
"Crime on our streets draws anger, as it should."
"Crime in our schools draws concern and outrage, as it should."
"But for too long, crime in the home has drawn the wrong reaction-- silence."
You and I can be proud of how much we've done to change that.
"This year, we broke the silence with a loud and emphatic message to abusive husbands and boyfriends: ""Your cowardly acts of violence will not be tolerated."
"You will be arrested, prosecuted and punished like any other violent criminal."
We put new teeth into orders of protection by increasing penalties for those who violate them.
"In New York, violating an order of protection used to be a misdemeanor--the equivalent of stealing a pack of gum.We made it a felony."
"And at a time of limited resources, we increased funding for shelter, counseling, and legal services for the victims of domestic violence."
The effects of domestic violence on children are heartbreaking.
No child should have to live in fear in their own home.
This year we passed a law requiring courts to consider the effects of domestic violence on children before making custody or visitation decisions.
"Judge Kaye, I commend you for leading this cause, and for developing special court parts in New York City to give victims of domestic violence the attention, care and compassion they need and deserve We must continue this fight."
There are women and children who are living in pain and fear.
They need and deserve our help.
We will not turn our back on them.
This year I will again propose legislation that will allow prosecutors to appeal low bail decisions and soft sentences that still plague domestic violence cases.
And I will introduce new legislation to raise the punishment for domestic assaults.
"In any civilized society, a domestic assault should be a felony offense."
"With your help, in New York, it will be."
"In New York, the message must be simple and direct-- Hands Off."
Violence can never be an acceptable response.
And there is a type of violent crime that is particularly destructive of us as a free society.
"In a civilized society, we cannot tolerate crimes that are motivated by hate."
Bias related crimes are so inherently destructive of society that we believe they merit special treatment.
"To assault a person because he is black, Hispanic or a member of a religious minority, is to tear at the very fabric of society."
To paint a swastika on a building is to do violence to our entire community.
These crimes threaten the spirit of tolerance that is essential to our democracy.
We must enact a bias crime law directed against these heinous acts.And we must do it this year.
"One hundred years ago, New York's Governor, Teddy Roosevelt led the modern conservation movement."
"Last year, our people went to the polls and rekindled that proud tradition of environmental leadership."
Theodore Roosevelt was my hero.You all know that.I named my son after him.
"TR knew, as we know, that to waste and destroy our natural resources--rather than preserving and amplifying their usefulness--is to compromise our future and the future of our children."
"Today, as we roar into a new century filled with opportunity, New York is again poised to lead the nation in clean air and clean water."
"With the passage of the Environmental Bond Act, we have the resources to protect and restore the state's natural treasures and to realize the economic advantages that come from sound environmental policy."
"Now, let's clean up the Great Lakes, the Finger Lakes, Lake Champlain, Onondaga Lake, the Hudson River, Long Island Sound and New York Harbor, and let's restore the full recreational and economic benefits they once provided."
Let's rid schools in New York City and Buffalo of polluting coal-fired heating systems to protect the health of our children.
"Let's achieve cleaner air quality in New York City, Westchester and across the state by replacing old diesel buses with clean-fuel vehicles."
"Let's close unlined and leaking landfills, such as Fresh Kills on Staten Island to protect water and air quality."
"And let's fix landfills that are closed but continue to pollute, like the Rush landfill in Monroe County."
Let's help towns like Huntington upgrade sewage treatment plants so we can restore the health and beauty of Long Island Sound.
"Let's preserve open space such as the Long Island Pine Barrens and the Albany Pine Bush, and let's create new state parks like Sterling Forest so future generations can experience their beauty."
"And let's clean up ""Brownfields""--abandoned, barren, neglected industrial sites that blight cities--and transform these unsightly and unproductive sites into economic opportunities that create jobs and breathe new life into our communities."
New York has voted to reaffirm its commitment to follow Teddy Roosevelt and again be the center of the modern conservation movement.
"With your support, we will continue to take the steps necessary to create a cleaner, greener, healthier New York."
"Like every New Yorker, whenever I travel across this state, I am overwhelmed by the magnificence of its landscape."
"From the power of Niagara Falls to the charm of the Finger Lakes, from the untamed majesty of the Adirondacks to the beauty of the Hudson Valley, from the Statue of Liberty to Montauk Point, we have so much to appreciate and care for."
Those who came before us had a vision and a commitment to protect this bounty.
"Now, with the support of the people, this generation will do its part to ensure clean water and clean air for the children of 21st Century."
"**** New York has only one destiny, and it is greatness."
"The legacy you and I are creating lies in the things that unite us, not the things that divide us."
Future generations will reap the benefits of our ability to find common ground.
But more importantly they will benefit from our willingness to do what is right.
Our future is brighter today because you and I have come together on so many issues.
But our success over the past two years must simply inspire us to do more.
"Because in New York, a brighter day is always on the horizon."
"Staring into the future, I see what George Washington saw more than 200 hundred years ago."
A state destined for greatness.
A state destined to lead America into a new century of untapped opportunity.
One hundred years of new history is waiting to be written.
Let's work together so there's no question about what will be written.
That these were the years when New Yorkers regained their freedom and reclaimed their government.
"That these were the years when the entrepreneurial spirit thrived, and the people thrived with it."
That these were the years when the flames of hope roared uncontrolled in a state governed by the people.
That these were the years when government returned power and hope and freedom back to the people.
That these were the years when New Yorkers roared into the 21st Century ready to fulfill their destiny.Thank you and God Bless.
