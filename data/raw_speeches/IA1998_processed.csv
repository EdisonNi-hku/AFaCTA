SENTENCES
"President Kramer, Speaker Corbett, Lieutenant Governor Corning, Chief Justice McGiverin, Senators and Representatives, State Officials, Distinguished Guests and Friends."
"One score and five years ago, I sat in this chamber as a freshman legislator, awed by the ornate surroundings, humbled by the responsibility given me by my constituents, and yet eager to do the people’s work."
"Today, on this, my 15th report to you and the people of Iowa on the condition of our state, I stand, as your Governor, just as awed, just as humbled, just as eager to get on with the people’s work."
My passion for our state has grown with every day I have served it.
My love of our people is deepened with every act of kindness and goodness I have encountered.
I am truly blessed to serve as your Governor.
I thank God every day for this opportunity and pray for the wisdom to make the right decisions.And I’m not done yet.
I am more pumped up about the future of our state than ever before.
"Now, don’t worry all you gubernatorial candidates – I’m not announcing for re-election here."
But I don’t plan to go gently into that good night either.
"I will spend every waking moment of my final year as Governor pushing and pulling, speaking out and working behind the scenes, all to make this great state the best it can be.We’ve come a long way."
We’ve weathered a farm crisis as searing as the Great Depression.
We’ve seen hardships as well as bounty; economic uncertainty as well as prosperity; natural disaster as well as nature’s benevolence.
"The heart and soul of our state has been tried and tested, reinvigorated and renewed, seasoned and strengthened."
"Iowa’s story is best described by something once said by a prominent American businessman: ""Good timber does not grow with ease."
The stronger the wind the stronger the trees.
"Today, we stand together stronger and taller than ever before."
"I am proud to report, the condition of our state is as good as we’ve ever had it."
"Consider just a few facts: In 1997, unemployment fell to the lowest level in history and the number of working Iowans rose to the highest level in history."
"In 1997, the number of jobs created by new businesses rose almost 19 percent."
"In 1997, we had one-third fewer Iowans on welfare than four years ago."
"In 1997, Iowa land values increased for the eleventh consecutive year."
"In 1997, we created one of the best student-to-computer ratios in the nation and within a year, every Iowa school district will be hooked up to the Information Superhighway."
"In 1997, we ended the year with a state budget surplus of over $800 million – the state’s best fiscal position ever."
This record of achievement didn’t happen by magic.
It took a lot of hard work by Iowans all over this fertile prairie all pitching in to build a better Iowa.
"And the people in this chamber, yes, you the members of the 77th General Assembly did your part too."
"A year ago, I stood in this very place and challenged you to take bold steps to make our state more competitive.You answered that call."
"And today, every Iowa taxpayer is paying 10 percent less in state income taxes."
The elimination of the inheritance tax for family members will help Iowa families pass on their piece of the Iowa Dream to loved ones.
"On behalf of all Iowans, I would like to thank you for taking those actions.But our job’s not complete."
"As we stand on the cusp of a new century, we face unique challenges brought on by our own successes."
We need more and better trained workers for a growing economy.
We need even stronger schools to educate our children for the rigors of a world marketplace.
We need new and more housing to provide shelter for a growing work force.
We need to give all parts of Iowa a share of our growth by processing agricultural products here in Iowa instead of shipping out our valuable commodities.
We need to protect Iowans from the few who break our laws and threaten our communities.
We need to continue sanding off the edges of uncompetitiveness that burden our people and the state’s long-term growth.
The sun has indeed been shining on our state – but there are storm clouds on the horizon.
"Dealing with diversity, international competition, the information explosion, and new stresses on the family all stare squarely at us.How do we deal with them?"
Our old ways of doing things won’t always work in this modern world.
"We can be Iowa stubborn, lock our heels and build walls around our state."
"Or we can recognize change, manage it and master our future.That is our choice."
I am of the firm belief that those storm clouds on our horizon will bring replenishing rains that will cause our economy to grow and our state to flourish – if we prepare the ground.
We are on the verge of historic change in our state.
"Since the invention of the plow centuries ago, our population has been weighted down by the need for fewer hands on the farm."
"Those Malthusians, who predict the future only by looking at the past, say the same is in store for us in the future.They’re wrong."
Our economy is crying for more hands to man the tiller of our economic growth.
We are in the same position as we were when our state was first settled.
"Back then we needed Dutch pioneers to till the rich, black soil of Sioux County; and the Jewish families to market goods in Burlington; and the German missionaries to open the doors of learning at Wartburg College in Waverly."
"Today, we need the Latinos, Asians, Bosnians and Kurds – all immigrants of the 21st century, eager to find new opportunities for a new life here in the Heartland of America."
Each new people – each new culture – has helped to enrich our Iowa character and values.And today is no exception.
Our sons and daughters will find good jobs here at home.
And families from other states will migrate here for a good life and good jobs.
They will be the engine of our growth for the next century as Iowa enters this new era of growth and opportunity – if we prepare the ground.
"We should start, as always, with our kids."
"At no time has it been more evident just how much our state cares about children than a couple of months ago, with the birth of the McCaughey septuplets."
"The outpouring of love and support that family is receiving from their church, community and the entire state is testimony to the caring nature of Iowa’s people."
We must now make sure that the McCaughey’s children – and all children in Iowa – get the best education in the world.
"Our schools are good, but not good enough."
Our schools are structured on a model suited for a time that is past – not one prepared to meet the challenges of the future.
No other public institution has been more resistant to change; no public institution needs it more.
Our education system still looks much like one designed for pioneers of the Old West and not the pioneers of the Information Age.
We cannot continue to operate that way.
"If you do nothing else this year, do not leave here without reforming our schools.The time to act is now."
"In my Condition of the State Message last year, I announced the formation of a citizen’s commission to help develop a vision and road map for education in the 21st century."
"Many members of that commission, including Chairman Marvin Pomerantz, are with us today and I would like to acknowledge them and thank them for their assistance in assembling a plan to remake Iowa’s public education system."
The vision they presented us with is the right one for Iowa.
That’s because it is based on the best research and just good common sense.How do we improve education?
With better teachers; By teaching children earlier and longer; and By locally setting standards with accountability for results.
These are the common sense building blocks of a new educational system that will prepare our state for the 21st century.Better teachers.
I’ll bet each of you can recall at least one teacher who made a big difference in your life.I can.
"I’ll never forget Lura Sewick, my 8th grade history teacher, and I’ll forever be indebted to her."
We need more Lura Sewicks to influence more children’s lives for the better.
To do that: We must reform the teacher education program to make it truly a profession.
My program includes rigorous reforms of teacher preparation and financial incentives for those who attain the highest level of certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
We must raise beginning teacher salaries so high achievers will be attracted to the profession.
"It’s been eleven years since we raised the beginning salaries, and We must pay good teachers and administrators more with a merit pay program and make it easier to get rid of bad teachers.Teach kids earlier and longer."
"By age three, three-fourths of a child’s brain is developed."
"Properly nurtured, that development will lead to a productive adult."
"Without nurturing, that lack of development can result in a juvenile delinquent and an unemployable adult."
State government can’t guarantee every child a good family.
But we can help Iowa’s families and schools give our children the building blocks for success in life.
I asked Lieutenant Governor Corning to head a workgroup that developed a strategy for helping Iowa’s children.
"By assisting at-risk children at an early age, research has shown that we will help them do better in school and stay away from crime and drugs."
Early intervention has even been shown to increase incomes for the parents as well as improve the opportunities for children.
What I am recommending is not a new government program – it is a new way of thinking and a better way to deliver the multitude of programs designed to make sure children get off to a good start in life.
"It is called, ""Building Blocks for Success,"" and it is an initiative designed to empower local communities with decision-making authority by block-granting funds and enabling them to set their own priorities for where money and services are needed most."
"It will create a new era of local empowerment, allowing us to tap the creativity and innovation of our people to help every Iowa child have a solid start in life."
"This year, we must also take action to expand health care coverage for low income children."
"The budget I am presenting today will allow us to provide health care coverage for over 55,000 more Iowa children."
"We must also: Ensure access to quality preschools and give every child a chance to attend all-day, everyday kindergarten."
The State should also provide assistance to those schools that make the decision to lengthen their school year.
"Schools should be open longer and serve as community learning centers, open to the entire community for recreational and educational activities."
Today’s kids get in trouble when they have nothing else to do.
Let’s keep them actively involved throughout the day and year.
Iowa has a long and proud tradition of being a local control state.
Our schools are the best because parents and communities take an active role in making them that way.
But our public schools must be accountable to the people they serve.
"Every Iowa school must have strong local standards – developed by school boards, teachers, administrators and parents."
The standards must be rigorous and set out clear expectations for learning.
Iowans deserve to know how their students and schools are doing in comparison to the competition.
"Each school in Iowa should be required to report uniformly on their students’ progress in reading, writing, math, science, and other basic skills.Better teachers."
Teaching kids earlier and longer.
Local accountability for results.
These are the three common sense principles upon which we must build our new public education system.
Don’t be fooled by those who say we need not change.
"If we fail to act now, our kids will forever suffer."
Many Iowa families make the financial sacrifice each year to send their child to the nonpublic school of their choice.
I am recommending the tuition and textbook credit be increased from $100 to $250 per student and that it be expanded to include the fees paid by the parents of public school students as well.
The quality of Iowa’s schools reaches well beyond the day a student achieves a high school diploma.
"The University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa provide a quality, affordable education while at the same time conducting world class scientific research."
"There is no finer example of the groundbreaking research and valuable services Iowans get than the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, which is celebrating its centennial this year."
"My budget includes funding to improve undergraduate education and libraries, to strengthen our Colleges of Education, and enhance initiatives under way in biosciences, value-added agriculture, the arts and humanities and international education."
So much of Iowa’s unique character is embodied in our independent colleges and universities.
"Through the Tuition Grant, we help thousands of Iowans have access to education they otherwise might not be able to afford."
"This year, we should increase the Iowa Tuition Grant to provide a higher level of assistance."
Our fifteen area community colleges are essential in preparing Iowa’s work force for the jobs of the future.
We must increase support of our community colleges and expand the Vocational Technical Grants to help part-time as well as full-time students.
The roots of this state are firmly grounded in the land that God has blessed us with – hundreds of thousands of acres of the richest soil anywhere.
The subsistence farming of the 19th century has evolved into a modern-day agriculture that uses satellites in space and seeds scientifically engineered to withstand the elements.
"With the growth of international markets, those of us here in the breadbasket of America will be facing tremendous opportunities."
No one – no one – will be better able to feed the world than we Iowans.
"We are the nation’s leading producer of corn, soybeans and pork."
"We also rank near the top in beef, turkey, egg, dairy, and even honey production."
"In the past, Iowans were the ones to grow the crops, but we’d export them to be processed."
Others reaped the economic rewards of what we Iowans sowed.No more.
"In community after community, we’ve seen what adding value to the commodities we produce can do – it creates quality jobs, increases the prices farmers get for their crops and brings new economic vitality to our communities."
"Last summer and fall, I was in over 60 counties to learn more about value-added agriculture."
What I discovered from Iowans was really quite profound: our future is on the table.
Iowans told me that a significant barrier to investment in new agricultural enterprises was the availability of investment capital.
We must encourage more networking among producers.
The state should become a reliable partner for those entrepreneurs who need help getting off to a good start in agriculture.
"We need to expand the innovative Beginning Farmer Loan Program that works with bankers to help new, young farmers get started."
"The average age of borrowers from this program is 32, the average age of an Iowa farmer is well over 50."
It is vital to get more young people into farming.
I am also recommending the creation of the Agrifutures Fund – a $25 million revolving loan guarantee program – as well as expanded use of the Link Deposit Program to support the development of value-added agriculture activities.
One of the fastest growing areas in agriculture is organic farming.
"This year, 62,000 acres are in organic production – a significant number, but not nearly enough to meet the growing demands."
We need to establish a state Organic Agriculture Certification Program to provide a valuable marketing tool that will add credibility and stability for the organic farmer to become competitive in the global marketplace.
A study by Iowa State University identified livestock production as the single most efficient way to add value to grain.
"Jobs related to the livestock industry employ more people than live in Council Bluffs, Dubuque and Iowa City combined."
"Three years ago, we adopted one of the nation’s strongest laws regulating the livestock industry."
"Our approach is based on strict, stable, scientifically-based, statewide standards."
"This year, we must expand the State’s ability to deal with chronic violators by enabling the Department of Natural Resources to deny new permits and revoke the existing ones of those who repeatedly break our environmental laws."
Good stewardship of the land has always been central to the Iowa character.
"We cannot allow the loud voices of a small minority to drown out the need for good, solid Iowa common sense policies."
Balancing strong statewide standards with an enhanced ability to stop those who do not live by the rules will provide the valuable environmental protection Iowans expect.
Succeeding in the global economy of the 21st century demands that our work to improve Iowa’s competitiveness never cease.
"The actions we took last year on income and inheritance taxes were significant steps forward, but we can do more – and we should."
Retirees add so much to the vibrancy of our communities and we can no longer afford to lose so many of them.
It is all too common to hear of long-time Iowa residents moving to Illinois or South Dakota upon retirement.
"This year, we should double the pension tax exemption."
I am also recommending we direct all revenues above expectations toward eliminating the tax on pensions altogether.
Iowa taxpayers deserve constitutional protection from high taxes and excessive government spending.
We should adopt the Taxpayers Rights Amendment and give them that protection.
"The State of Iowa should encourage, not discourage, its people to have access to the information superhighway."
That’s why I am recommending we eliminate the sales tax on Internet services.
Our elimination of the inheritance tax for family members will allow hundreds of Iowa families to pass on their farm or business to the next generation.
But I think we should ask ourselves if it is really fair to make families wait until a death to transfer their assets without the burden of excessive taxation.
The current capital gains tax exclusion should be increased to 100 percent and expanded to include the assets of family farms and businesses sold or transferred to lineal descendents.
We can also make our state safer.
"The opening of the Clarinda, Newton and Fort Dodge prisons gives us greatly needed prison space to keep dangerous criminals where they should be – behind bars."
"The budget I am recommending will continue to increase our prison capacity by adding 500 beds at our existing prisons in Mitchellville, Mount Pleasant and Fort Madison."
The shocking rise in crimes by sexual predators is of grave concern to me and all Iowans.
"Let us have the courage this year to take steps to prevent these crimes by authorizing the use of temporary hormonal treatment of sex offenders, something that has been proven effective in those places bold enough to take this action."
We must also improve the monitoring of sexual offenders as well as make it easier for Iowans to know if one is living in their midst.
"A few years ago, most Iowans had no idea what methamphetamines were."
All too quickly that has changed because too many lives have been lost to this horrible drug.
"In just four years, we have seen a twelve-fold increase in the number of Iowans seeking treatment for addiction to methamphetamine."
"With tougher penalties, a strong anti-drug education campaign and a coordinated enforcement effort, we are determined to win the war against this deadly killer."
"Drug use in the workplace is a great concern of Iowa workers, who are put at risk everyday because we have one of the weakest drug testing laws in the country."
Iowans seeking treatment for drug abuse tell us that workplace drug testing would have helped them avoid drugs.
"As I travel the state, I sense there is a growing consensus that drugs are definitely affecting the quality of Iowa’s workforce."
We cannot afford to wait any longer.
"This year, we must strengthen our workplace drug testing law."
I am also asking you to pass a strong Crime Victims’ Bill of Rights.
"And, we need the possibility of the death penalty for multiple killings and the cold-blooded murder of rape and kidnap victims."
We should also take action to ban the heinous procedure of partial birth abortion.
"Whether it be the victims of crime or our next-door neighbors, Iowans have always been willing to lend a helping hand."
"I remember President Reagan saying that ""the success story of America is neighbor helping neighbor."
Community service and volunteerism are important chapters in Iowa’s success story.
"Over the past couple of years, I have spent considerable time volunteering with Iowans."
"From painting a school in Waterloo to serving meals to seniors in Bedford, I’ve seen volunteers truly making a difference in the lives of others."
"As we build Iowa’s foundation for the future, we can never forget the importance of volunteerism."
I am proclaiming 1998 as the Year of the Volunteer in Iowa.
"In June of this year, we will be having a state summit on volunteerism – in the spirit of the Presidents’ Summit for America’s Future held in Philadelphia."
The Iowa Summit will bring together teams from all 99 counties to set forth a bold agenda of helping others.
Seated in the gallery today are many of the members of the steering committee – from throughout the state – who are helping to put the Iowa Summit together and I would like to recognize them at this time.
"Today, I invite you to join me in recommitting ourselves and our state to caring for those in need."
"Making schools better, adding value to agricultural commodities, making our state more competitive, protecting the safety of our citizens."
This is our common sense agenda for 1998.Our state is in good shape.
"It is tempting to sit back, pat our stomach, and rock away these good times."
But that would only guarantee that they will never last.
"My love for this state is founded not on what Iowa has been, but what it can be."
"Iowa can be a state that is growing good, quality jobs everywhere."
Iowa can be a state with the best schools and smartest kids in the world.
"Iowa can be a place to raise and nurture a family for people from every race, religion and country."
"Yes, I am convinced that those challenges which face us – which some see as storm clouds on our horizon – are truly directed by God to bring us the refreshing rains of spring – if we prepare the ground."
The program I have outlined for you does just that.
When the gavel has fallen and our work here is done – when the last echoes of speeches have faded – let us be able to say that we truly seized the day.
We ushered in a new century of growth and opportunity for Iowa.
That will be our lasting legacy.
Thank you and God bless the state of Iowa.
