SENTENCES
Good morning.Thank you very much.
"Mr. Speaker, Madame President, Members of the 189th Legislature, distinguished guests, my Fellow Pennsylvanians."
It is a privilege to be with you this morning to present my proposed 2005-2006 budget for the Commonwealth.
"We are gathered in this magnificent chamber to begin anew the essential practice of governing – making choices about public priorities for the benefit of our employer, the citizens of Pennsylvania."
"That is what the budget represents, our consensus about the programs and services we provide to every county, city and hometown across the Commonwealth."
"Governing is choosing, and governing in a democratic society means having the freedom to choose."
"So let us begin today by recognizing those whose service in defense of liberty around the world secures the freedoms that we enjoy today in this chamber, throughout Pennsylvania and across this great nation."
"Pennsylvania, through its men and women in the Guard, reserve and active duty forces, has done more than its share to advance the cause of democracy and freedom in the Middle East."
No state in the union has sent more Guardsmen and women to support the international effort to stop terrorism than Pennsylvania.
"Since September 11th, 2001, more than 14,500 Pennsylvania National Guard members have left the comfort of their homes to risk their lives for our security."
Among the American service men and women killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are 69 Pennsylvanians who helped make that democracy possible.
Every American had to be deeply moved at seeing the sense of pride of the Iraqi people as they courageously went to the polls last week.
The families of these brave Pennsylvania service men and women now know for sure that their loved ones did not die in vain.
"Along with our heartfelt prayers and sympathy to their families, I ask you to join me in a moment of silence for these Pennsylvania heroes."
(Pause) Their mission continues.
"As we gather this morning, there are 2,725 Pennsylvania Guard members and many more Pennsylvania reservists and active duty personnel deployed overseas."
"Later this month another 2,127 Guardsmen and women will leave for training that will prepare them for service in Iraq."
"Let us keep them in our prayers today and in the difficult days that lie ahead of them, and pray that they return home safe and sound."
These good men and women are supported by the outstanding work performed at Pennsylvania’s 12 military installations.
"At Letterkenney, Pennsylvanians are hard at work retrofitting vehicles with armor to protect our troops."
"At Tobyhanna, critical maintenance on communications systems ensures our troops’ safety."
"The nation’s security depends on these facilities, and so do our communities."
"We cannot afford to lose one installation – their efficiency serves the nation and the 20,000 Pennsylvanians they employ keep our communities vibrant."
"This year, the Base Re-alignment and Closure Commission will eliminate up to 25% of the military bases across the country."
"Following the initiative of Senator Mellow, we’ve already committed 5 million dollars to support keeping Pennsylvania’s military bases open."
"We must continue to work hard in a bipartisan fashion, at both the state and federal level to keep all of our bases open."
Pennsylvania faces many challenges this year -- this budget is constructed to meet those challenges.
Federal support to ensure that the most vulnerable among us are cared for is shrinking and as a result we are presented with painful choices and difficult decisions.
"These decisions require discipline and courage and, most importantly, a vision where the touchstone is compassion."
I do not fear our ability to make these decisions and neither should you.
"Two years ago, I stood before you and presented a budget with an equally difficult set of choices."
And with your help Pennsylvania has made unprecedented progress.
"In 2003, the pundits openly questioned whether any of the initiatives I proposed would ever be adopted."
"But we worked together, and we got results."
"Together, we passed the historic increases in funding for public education; an Economic Stimulus Package to provide the needed capital to jump-start Pennsylvania’s economy; expansion of our PACE/PACENET program making prescription drugs more affordable for senior citizens; and at long last, passage of legislation that will provide unprecedented cuts in local property taxes."
It would be fair to characterize the budget debates that followed the introduction of these initiatives as spirited.
"I recognize that having covered as much ground as we have, sometimes the journey was a little bumpy."
"But it has been well worth the trip, because we’ve gone so far in such a short period of time."
Together we passed the largest increase in public school funding in 20 years and targeted funds to what we know works best.
Last week you received the mid-year report on the Accountability Block Grant program.
It details the tremendous success achieved through a truly bi-partisan effort.
"Parents, teachers and superintendents across the state have lauded these new investments."
But new funding must be coupled with increased accountability to get the results we need.
"I stood before you last year, and the year before, and asked you to consider legislation that holds our academic leaders more accountable for the performance of every student."
"Again this year, I urge this body to formalize its commitment to our children by basing superintendent and principal contract renewals, in part, on improved student performance."
And by changing how we pay teachers so that they are rewarded for teaching skills -- not just longevity.
"In the face of a daunting budget deficit and a sluggish national economy, we enacted a 2.3 billion dollar Economic Stimulus Program that provides needed capital for strategic investments throughout Pennsylvania – investments that will help cities and towns thrive once again after years of struggling to survive and compete."
"The Economic Stimulus Program is already generating significant positive momentum for Pennsylvania, in just its first year of operation."
"Our economy is on the move, our companies are beginning to expand, and new companies are coming here as well."
The Commonwealth Financing Authority has already pumped 260 million dollars in public and private funds into our economy.
And the Governor’s Action Team has increased its effectiveness.
From 2003 to 2004 the number of GAT investment projects brought to completion increased by over 65 percent.
"Just shy of 100 million dollars in public and private funds are being put to work to build new houses, start the Keystone Innovation Zones, improve Main streets, and launch the Elm Street programs."
"Over the next two months, 83 million dollars in Home Town Streets grants are hitting the ground in 51 counties."
"And since 2003, we have awarded more than a half a billion dollars in redevelopment assistance capital grants to projects in 48 counties."
Each of these state dollars is matched with at least one dollar from local sources -- that’s a total of well over a billion and a half dollars in new funds helping to rebuild our communities.
"While these investments get sites prepared and help improve our infrastructure, we continue to direct investment to our core industries – agriculture and manufacturing."
"For the first time ever, equipment loans from our traditional economic development funds are being made available to farmers, the Governor’s Action Team is increasing its work with farm-related businesses and our stimulus program earmarks an unprecedented 100 million dollars to help Pennsylvania farmers."
"In the face of unfair international trade practices and the twin budget busters of rising energy and health care costs, Pennsylvania’s manufacturers desperately need our support if they are to successfully compete."
"To that end, we have directed tens of millions of dollars to fund training for manufacturing workers and to improve or expand manufacturing plants."
"In fact, sixty percent of the Governor’s Action Team’s investments this year were made in manufacturing companies."
With 174 million dollars in public financing we have attracted investments of more than 1.4 billion dollars to our manufacturing sector.The result?
"We’ve saved over 33,000 jobs, and we’re adding more than 7,000 jobs to our manufacturing base."
"Beyond financing, following the suggestions of Representative Veon, we are offering intensive technical support to manufacturing through the 5 million dollars we included in last year’s budget to boost funding for the Industrial Resource Centers and through our new Manufacturing Ombudsman and our Office of Trade Policy."
These new offices will help retool our plants and rebut unfair trade practices so our firms will succeed in the global marketplace.
The private sector has recognized the value of our stimulus effort and is now investing in our economy with record levels of new capital.
"In March, Citizens Bank took a leadership role in partnering with the Commonwealth to attract new manufacturing jobs to our state."
"The Citizens Job Bank, the first program of its kind, made 100 million dollars in low-interest loan funds for manufacturing and industrial companies that agree to create forty new jobs for every one million dollars borrowed."
Other private sector lenders are now competing to meet the needs of our small employers.
"Last month, Sovereign Bank announced a loan fund of 250 million dollars targeted to small companies with annual revenues of less than 10 million dollars."
These are the very firms where innovation is likely to happen – but they are also the very firms that find it hard to attract the capital they need to expand.
"Best of all, these new loan pools demonstrate that the private sector is rallying in support of Pennsylvania’s companies and their employees – the people who are the backbone of our economic recovery."
We developed the Economic Stimulus Program together.
Wise input from every caucus improved upon my original proposal.
"You added tax increment financing for non-profits, such as Fox Chase Cancer Center; water and sewer financing that will allow companies like Aventis Pasteur to expand production in Pennsylvania to meet the global need for flu vaccines and other medicines; state-of-the art approaches to the creation of venture capital funds; and the options for grants as well as loans to rebuild our infrastructure to help attract new business."
"These additions, and many others developed in this Capitol, helped to make the Stimulus Program what it is today: a real source of hope and the promise of a better future for workers across the Commonwealth."
"It is too early to gauge the full effect of the Stimulus Program, but Pennsylvania is already showing signs of recovery."
Seventy thousand more Pennsylvanians are working today than were working a year ago.
"And as we provide new ways for our businesses to compete, we continue to apply business principles of productivity and cost-savings to the operation of state government."
"As a result of our management and productivity initiatives, we have saved the taxpayers 475 million dollars since this administration took office two years ago."
Most important is that most of these are not one-time savings.
"We are generating 341 million dollars a year in operational savings, thanks to a business-like approach to running the government."
We are using hard-nosed business metrics to drive down the costs of our “back office” operations.
"By consolidating our contracts and leveraging our purchasing, we will generate more than 130 million dollars in annual savings."
While reaping these savings we more than doubled the percentage of minority and disadvantaged businesses contracting with the Commonwealth.
We will continue to squeeze every nickel out of the cost of government.
"We exceeded our goal of a five percent reduction in the cost of operating state vehicles by eliminating 660 vehicles from the fleet, saving more than 13 million dollars."
We used to pay the Social Security Administration 31 million dollars a year to print the state portion of the SSI checks and those costs were projected to increase to 36 million dollars next year.
Now we do it ourselves for less than 6 million dollars a year.
We reevaluated our telephone contracts.
"As a result we shut down nearly 3,000 unused phone lines and we expect to reduce our telephone bills by more than 5 million dollars annually."
We saw a 14 percent increase over 2003 for taxpayers filing their state tax returns online – a savings of almost 3.3 million dollars last year.
"And more online savings are expected this year.We can do more, and we will."
"Today, without furloughs or layoffs of any kind, we have 2,883 fewer Commonwealth positions than we had when I took office in January 2003."
"That’s a savings of 160 million dollars annually, without any decrease in the quality of services we provide."
"All of these savings are being plowed back into the budget to meet the rising cost of health care for our employees, and to preserve our safety net programs."
The savings made it possible for us to balance this budget.
"Clearly, Pennsylvania taxpayers win when we run government like a business."
But cutting costs is only half the job of improving Pennsylvania’s bottom line.
The other half is increasing revenues.
The Pennsylvania Lottery is now the third-fastest growing lottery in the nation.
"Last October, Lottery Insights Magazine described our lottery innovations as “an exciting new approach with exciting new results."
"Lottery revenues are 260 million dollars beyond what we earned last year, and we now expect to end this year at least 479 million dollars ahead of lottery proceeds in 2002-03."
"Best of all, the lottery is paying off like never before for Pennsylvania’s senior citizens."
"Today, because of the gains in our lottery, and the comprehensive PACE reform passed unanimously by both chambers, more than 70,000 older adults have been added to the rolls of our nationally recognized PACE and PACENET programs."
That’s an increase of 32 percent.
"By the end of the year we expect to bring that total to 115,000 new seniors who get this great prescription drug coverage."
"At long last, we are also taking an entrepreneurial approach to the operation of Pennsylvania’s state stores."
"And it’s working here, too: profits from liquor sales increased by more than 31.5 percent in fiscal year 2003-2004."
Already this year sales in state stores are 6.5 percent higher than they were last year at this time.
For the first time we are making it possible for Pennsylvanians to purchase state store products in supermarkets.
The results have been phenomenal.
"We need to continue creating jobs and opportunities for Pennsylvania workers, but we also need to make sure that these workers can actually get to work each day."
"To do that we must address our transportation needs – mass transit, and the repair of our roads, bridges and highways."
"Our mass transit system is in crisis, and if we continue to ignore it, we will have effectively stranded hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens who depend on buses, subways and commuter trains to get to work each day."
"And let’s be very clear: This is a problem that threatens all of Pennsylvania, not only Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, but other transit agencies as well, including those with over one million riders per year in State College, Harrisburg, Johnstown, Scranton, Erie, the Lehigh Valley, Luzerne, Lancaster, Williamsport, York and New Castle."
I urge this Legislature to address our transportation needs as the top priority of the new legislative session.We cannot wait.
We must identify and implement an adequate solution for mass transit that does not take any more funds designated to repair our highways and bridges or drain already scarce resources from our General Fund.
"For my part, I pledge to continue to work with the leaders of the four legislative caucuses to develop a consensus on what we are prepared to support."
"But make no mistake: We must work together, and we must act now."
"Three weeks ago, Republican leaders in the House proposed an alternative to my Growing Greener II initiative called Green PA."
This new proposal offers us some new ideas.
But best of all it recognizes that we must significantly invest in cleaning and preserving our environment now.
I look forward to working with the House and the Senate in the weeks ahead to reach a consensus on this initiative.
"But it is time to give the voters a voice in this debate, too, by asking for their support of these environmental initiatives this spring at the polls."
"We can meet this deadline, but we must act together now."
The Hazardous Sites Clean-up fund faces a complete shutdown for lack of funds.
"Likewise, without action this July we must significantly cut the funds used to preserve farmland."
"Our state is littered with polluted abandoned industrial sites that choke economic growth, and acid mine drainage that stains our rivers and streams."
Growing Greener II must be enacted to address these critical issues and help maintain our treasured natural assets.
I urge us all to remain focused on the goals we share across party lines to repair and preserve our environment and enact this vitally important legislation no later than March 17th so it can be voted on in the May election.
We have already begun to effect enormous change in Pennsylvania’s economy through the economic stimulus program.
"But we can do more, and we can start with business taxes."
This budget continues the phase out of the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax from its current rate of 5.99% to 4.99% beginning January 2006.
Today I am also proposing to reduce the corporate income tax rate and to create a fairer business tax reporting system for all companies in the Commonwealth.
"When I campaigned across this state, I heard repeatedly from our business community that we needed to reduce the Corporate Net Income tax rate."
"Our CNI rate is the third- highest in the nation, and it is a significant roadblock to business growth."
"Last year, I formed the Business Tax Reform Commission to study Pennsylvania’s business tax structure."
I want to thank the citizens who labored for us on this Commission – those I appointed and those appointed by the Legislature.
They did a great job crafting a smart business tax reform package.
They recommended leveling the playing field among businesses by imposing a new one percent income tax on pass through entities such as S-corporations and limited liability corporations and partnerships.
Given the sluggish national economy I believe that such a tax increase could cripple these firms.
"But the good news is that even without the proposed one percent tax on the income of these businesses, we can still afford to implement the rest of the recommendations and reduce our CNI rate to 7.99 percent."
"This is a 20 percent reduction in our rate of corporate taxation, and it will help our businesses compete."
"If we implement this reduction, Pennsylvania’s tax rates will be lower than those in Ohio, West Virginia New Jersey, and Delaware."
"The Commission members were troubled by one key finding of their research, and rightly so: Only 27 percent of the corporations in this state pay the CNI tax."
"That means almost three-quarters of the 145,000 corporations in the state who are subject to this tax do not pay any corporate income taxes at all."
And that is simply not fair to the businesses that do pay or to the taxpaying citizens of this state.
"To address this problem, the Commission wisely proposed that we phase in a system of reporting income that ensures that corporations doing business in Pennsylvania pay taxes on all income earned in Pennsylvania."
"Seventeen other states already require what is called combined reporting, and it is time we joined that list."
"In addition to the Commission’s recommendations, I ask you today to ensure that every professional given the privilege to earn a living in our state pay his or her taxes in full, and on time."
The Commonwealth could collect almost 20 million dollars a year from businesses that fail to pay their taxes.
I urge you to stand up for those who pay their fair share in taxes and pass legislation that will allow us to withhold businesses licensure from those who do not.
"Beyond deep cuts in our business taxes, I am today proposing a series of new strategic investments to build a stronger Pennsylvania economy."
"These investments tap into our greatest source of capital – our human capital, the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who make up our current and future workforce."
"Our goal is simple: invest in them, help them become better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st Century economy, and we are all better served."
"Eighty-two percent of businesses surveyed by our Business Calling Program since 2003 say they are having difficulty recruiting new employees – in particular, nearly two out of every three respondents identified lack of candidate skills or qualifications as a problem in recruitment."
Another barrier to employment for new workers is often the prohibitive cost of childcare.
"This budget includes funding to help our working families by providing 1,540 additional children access to our subsidized childcare system."
But our job will not be complete if we only create jobs and remove barriers like the cost of childcare.
We must also prepare our citizens so they can fill those jobs.
"In late 1999, Forbes Magazine ran an extraordinary column that I remember to this day."
It focused on the Harvard Class of 1949 – a class that today is peppered with billionaires and leaders who made spectacular successes of their lives and created millions of jobs for other Americans.
"The Class of ’49 shared some common traits, especially the fact that a large majority, having just returned from World War II, went to college on the GI Bill."
Uncle Sam provided the means for many of these men to get their degree and build a life that their own fathers could only dream about.
"Today, on a smaller scale, we propose to replicate the extraordinary impact of the GI bill in Pennsylvania by offering new opportunity to our students and workers in companies across the Commonwealth."
This budget includes 100 million dollars in new funds that will be combined with the terrific new investments announced by PHEAA last week to launch an exciting new initiative that is critical to our economic recovery strategy.
"It is called Job Ready Pennsylvania, and we intend to use it to improve the effectiveness of the more than 2 billion dollars in state and federal workforce, high school and vocational education funds that we currently invest in Pennsylvania’s workers."
"The goal of Job Ready Pennsylvania is nothing less than re-making Pennsylvania’s workforce as the best in the nation – educated, trained and ready for the challenges of the 21st Century economy."
"According to a recent report commissioned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not one state in the entire nation requires its high school graduates to take courses that reflect the real-world demands of work or post-secondary education."
"To make matters worse, the report points out that while students across the nation must learn more, Pennsylvania is one of only eight states that do not have standard high school graduation requirements at all."
"Today, only one in three Pennsylvania school districts requires four years of math."
High school graduation requirements make sense.
"We should have them, but the truth is, we cannot wait for them to be implemented."
So the Department of Education is already working with our high schools to retool and meet national standards for excellence.
"Project 720 is aimed at reforming how we prepare our graduates, from the first day of ninth grade through last day of twelfth grade – 720 days."
"In this budget, I propose to double the number of schools who are teaching the skills today that our graduates will need for tomorrow’s jobs."
I am particularly excited by our efforts to use 12th grade better.
Senator Brightbill has proposed an approach to helping school districts pay for students who have the skill and drive to take college level courses in 12th grade.
Many states are far ahead of us and their students are showing great results.
This budget makes dual enrollment – enrolling in college while still in high school – a financially viable option for more Pennsylvania school districts than ever before.
"In announcing the new Task Force to Connect Education to the Workplace, Representative Sam Smith said: “Since 1995, we have made significant gains in improving the quality of education in Pennsylvania, yet there is still some type of disconnect with our schools and the workplace.I concur."
"We must upgrade the training available for the estimated 90,000 students who will graduate from our vocational and technical education schools."
"For too long we have shortchanged the basic education of these students, and for too many we have offered training that is not in sync with real jobs."
We will launch a five-year program to work with employers to re-tool our vocational and career training system.
We will work with our schools to improve their curricula and make smarter equipment purchases and make sure that these students meet Pennsylvania’s proficiency standards for high school reading and math.
"By better directing existing resources, we can ensure that these students leave high school with the skills they need to secure good jobs or succeed in higher education."
"In 1997, the House Subcommittee on Workforce Development issued a thoughtful report."
"It concluded that Pennsylvania’s workforce system should be competitive, driven by the private sector, based on performance, and focused on high-skills/high-wage jobs to support a stronger economy.I wholeheartedly agree."
"The challenge we face is that under federal law, most of our workforce training funding is under the control of local workforce investment boards over which we have limited authority."
An integral component of Job Ready Pennsylvania is using federal funds that we do control to financially reward workforce investment boards that follow the advice of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Development.
For the first time we will make grants to Workforce Investment Boards to serve as an incentive for improving the strategic use of workforce funds.
These grants will be made only to those Boards that meet our new High Performance Workforce Investment Standards.
The real beneficiaries of these awards will be the hard-working Pennsylvanians who get good jobs that allow them to become providers for their families and contributing residents in their communities.
Fifty years ago the two major contributors to business success were location and ability to tap natural resources.
"To those ingredients they added the hard work of their employees, and the good companies thrived."
"We all know that in today’s economy, providing a highly skilled workforce is even more important than location or natural resources."
"In our 21st Century economy, education is the key to progress, and without it our workers are at a distinct disadvantage."
"We need to help them help themselves and their families by investing in training programs that build better skills, so that they can earn better wages."
"Today, I propose to invest in our adult workforce."
This budget includes an additional 15 million dollars on top of the 36 million dollars that we currently spend for our customized job training and other programs targeted to increase the skills of those currently employed.
These funds will be allocated by the Department of Labor and Industry to partnerships of employers who have common training needs for their current workers.
Through strategic use of these funds we expect that thousands of currently employed workers will upgrade their skills and in turn improve the competitiveness of Pennsylvania companies.
Pennsylvania’s economic growth is hampered by a shortage of skilled workers in fields ranging from nursing to high-tech research and development.
"In this budget, I propose two strategies to fill the demand for these jobs – jobs that will help thousands of our fellow citizens reach new levels of economic success."
"First, this budget includes the largest increase in community college funding in 15 years."
It includes a 21 million dollar increase in the state share of tuition costs and targets these funds to courses that make a real difference in the workforce.
We also have included almost 2 million dollars to support the debt service on 20 million dollars in capital funding to augment our current support of community college capital needs.
"Second, Pennsylvania will make an historic increase in funding for student grants."
For the last several years rising tuition costs have outpaced inflation.
"To address this problem, we approached the PHEAA board asking them to look for ways to make college more affordable."
The responsive leadership and financial solvency of PHEAA permitted it to respond to our initiatives and as a result PHEAA will invest more than 300 million dollars in new funds for student grants over the next four years – increasing our student grant pool by 18 percent in just one year.
This extraordinary response from PHEAA is testament to the wise stewardship of the dedicated House and Senate members who sit on the PHEAA Board.
Hard working families are pinching pennies to send their children to college.
We all know that student grants go a long way in making college affordable.
"In the first year of this partnership, PHEAA will make available an additional 63 million dollars in grants to students while this budget boosts the Commonwealth’s investment in student grants to 368 million dollars."
"In addition to curbing the impact of rising tuition for traditional college students, for the first time PHEAA will allocate funds to help working adults who have busy lives take courses to improve their skills and their earnings."
Working adults who have the time to enroll for three or more courses a semester are eligible for PHEAA grants right now.
"But that’s asking a great deal, especially of working parents."
"With these new funds, workers who have the time to take one or two courses will also be able to tap these precious funds and as a result become a more highly skilled, and hopefully more highly rewarded employee."
Let me share with you another example of the impact of this partnership between PHEAA and the Administration.
"By 2010 Pennsylvania is expected to have a shortage of 16,000 nurses."
"The natural reaction to this is, “Let’s find ways to attract more students to our nursing schools."
"But the fact is, our nursing schools are already turning away thousands of applicants annually because the schools do not have enough teachers, lab space or the residency slots."
The problem is that our schools lack the resources to grow.
"Today, in partnership with the PHEAA Foundation, I am pleased to announce that we will be investing 10 million dollars a year for the next four years to provide the resources to train more nurses."
"This expansion in nursing training slots will result in almost twice the number of nursing graduates a year – instead of an annual rate of 4,500 nurses graduating, we hope to put 8,000 nursing graduates to work in health care facilities across the Commonwealth each year."
These selected new investments in Pennsylvania’s economy are vital to our continued momentum.
"Though they focus on education and training, it would be inaccurate to think of them as just additional funding for education."
"These are investments in our greatest resource, our human capital, designed to produce a stronger Pennsylvania economy and a stronger Pennsylvania workforce."
We have the chance to do for Pennsylvania’s students and workers what the GI bill did for the growth of our national economy more than 50 years ago.
Let’s help them build a better future for themselves and for all of us.
We are making remarkable progress in Pennsylvania.
And we have done all of this in the face of the slow national economic recovery and significant federal cuts in spending for social programs.
It is important to understand the context in which we are operating as a state government.
"While we succeeded in drawing down more federal funds for the Nursing Home Assessment and the Medicaid HMO Assessment, we continue to face even greater reductions in other areas of federal support."
We face very serious budget constraints and they are real.
TANF – the federal block grant to support the costs of welfare -- is capped and before I even took office the Commonwealth had over-committed these resources.
"For the last two years we had TANF federal reserves that could be drawn down to cover these unbudgeted commitments, but there are no more reserves to tap."
We also no longer have the fiscal life preserver that the Congress threw us in Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.
"This budget copes with losing almost 850 million dollars in temporary federal fiscal support, over half of which was dedicated to defray the rising costs of medical assistance."
This is especially troubling because we are losing federal funds while health care costs are going up by double digits.
The plan before you today is carefully crafted to replace the loss of these federal funds while preserving our safety net.
"It is estimated that an additional 100,000 elderly, disabled, chronically ill individuals and poor families will be eligible for medical assistance in the next fiscal year."
"If we were to preserve all of the health care services we currently provide, we would need to add another 580 million dollars to this budget."
Our economy is just beginning to show signs of recovery but many of our citizens and businesses are still struggling to make ends meet.
As a result this budget does not include any tax increases – that is surely welcome news.
"Unfortunately, Washington is cutting its support for medical assistance while all across America, costs and demand for services are rising to higher levels than ever before."
Listen to the words of the Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee: ''I certainly understand the need to balance the federal budget.
But people need to remember that to balance the federal budget off the backs of the poorest people in the country is simply unacceptable.
You don't pull feeding tubes from people.
You don't pull the wheelchair out from under the child with muscular dystrophy. '
I agree with Governor Huckabee and as a result this budget includes no cuts in eligibility for safety net services.
The simple fact is that Americans are living longer and the baby boomers are aging.
"As a result we need more complex, and unfortunately more expensive, health care."
Many folks simply cannot afford it.
"In fact, the fastest growing segment of Pennsylvanians receiving publicly funded health care is senior citizens in nursing homes."
The second fastest growing group is chronically ill adults who have no income.
"No one in this room believes we should cut off care to the elderly or the sick, yet the cost for caring for both of these groups are going through the roof."
"While health care for a mother and child on public assistance is 2,400 dollars a year, the cost for nursing home care for a senior is 23,000 dollars a year.And both are rising."
"The joint federal/state Medicaid program effectively is the safety net for the poor and elderly, and costs have risen dramatically over the last three years."
"Every state in the nation is feeling the pinch, not just Pennsylvania."
"Nationally, Medicaid costs have jumped nearly 50 percent in three years, from 205.7 billion dollars in 2000 to approximately 300 billion dollars in 2004 – let me say that again, 300 billion dollars."
"Consider this headline from the front page of Monday’s Wall Street Journal: Critical Condition: Surging Costs for Medicaid Ravage State, Federal Budgets."
Or this headline from yesterday’s Philadelphia Inquirer: U. S. Medicaid Cutbacks Would Hurt States Twice.
This is not a Democrat or Republican issue.
"Consider that Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who as President Bush’s budget chief was known as a staunch opponent of taxes, is pushing a temporary income tax increase to cope with his state’s budget deficit."
Governors from red states and blue are joining together to urge Washington to ease the tremendous burden that rising costs and shrinking federal support have put on state budgets.
"Indeed, for the first time ever, combined state spending on Medicaid has outstripped state spending on K to 12 education."
Just think about that: Medicaid spending is outstripping spending for education.
I am determined that we in Pennsylvania must preserve the health care safety net even as we work to control the spiraling cost of health care on the state budget.
"We close this gap by modernizing how we purchase health care services, restraining growth on annual increases paid for services, improving our efforts to ferret out fraud and abuse, and by asking health consumers to make better choices about their care."
We also close this gap by making some difficult cuts in every operating department and continuing our aggressive efforts to bring down the cost of regular government operations.
"The fact is, while states all over the nation are cutting health care and other social programs to close their deficits, we cannot ignore our moral obligation to provide services for those who need them."
Our budget actually includes a spending increase of 612 million dollars in Department of Public Welfare funding.
The Pennsylvania solution is a targeted set of reforms that will control our growth in costs while ensuring access to good care.
We will save 147 million dollars a year by being smarter in how we purchase medical assistance services.
"For instance, 80 percent of those on medical assistance see doctors about 12 times a year."
But we purchase unlimited access for every recipient.
"By purchasing smarter, we can ensure that access to health care is preserved and ensure that we are not paying for visits that never happen."
"In addition to purchasing smarter, we propose a modest increase in co-pays that are far below the rate of inflation for medical services and prescription drugs."
Both of these changes make it possible to maintain the current comprehensive menu of wellness and care options for those on medical assistance.
When you put our changes in national context I believe you will concur that our approach is the most sensitive and the most fiscally responsible.
"Consider the following: 39 of the 50 states are facing serious budget problems directly due to rising health care costs for those on medical assistance; 17 states are proposing cutting recipients from their medical assistance programs -- 323,000 in Tennessee, 60,000 in Florida and 50,000 in Mississippi."
"Last year Connecticut’s budget cut 20,000 from its rolls, 10,000 were cut in Massachusetts, 27,000 in Minnesota, and 24,000 in Oregon; More than half of the states already have caps on the number of outpatient visits and other medical service caps; Five states refuse to cover dental services; 26 states prohibit chiropractic services; and 13 states do not pay for podiatry services."
We will have to make some bold changes when it comes to one of the fastest cost drivers -- prescription drugs.
We propose to limit the growth in drug costs by over 50- million dollars annually by establishing a preferred drug list for the Medicaid program.
Controlling spending growth requires innovative management practices and an abiding passion for catching those who steal from the system.
This past year we aggressively investigated suspicious billing from hundreds of providers.
We found that a select group of pharmacies and doctors were flooding the streets with OxyContin and other controlled substances.
We found doctors billing us for services with no evidence of seeing patients or boosting billing codes to bilk the system.
We recovered over 15 million dollars from providers who over billed our system and referred 64 cases of provider misconduct to the Attorney General.
We also found recipients who feed their drug habits by making dozens of visits to emergency rooms or various doctors each year.
"To curb their substance abuse and their abuse of our system, 550 recipients have lost their rights to control their health choices."
"Beyond those who purposely abuse our system, we want to work with you this year to close our biggest Medical Assistance loophole."
"Too often, when an individual gets a job and is enrolled in an employer health plan, Medical Assistance is still charged for health care coverage."
Last year we recovered 87.5 million dollars by transferring charges that were booked to MA but should have been booked to private insurers.
But it is very difficult to capture the data necessary because insurers are not required to provide the information we need to resolve this billing nightmare.
We believe there are millions more to be gained by getting access to this data.
I am asking as part of this budget package that you enact legislation that requires insurers to provide this data and help us protect the taxpayers of this state.
"In addition to stepping up our fraud and abuse investigations, this budget funds child welfare services with significantly more general fund resources because we no longer have the federal TANF cushion to tap."
While this increases a general fund obligation we also ensure that we use our dollars wisely and improve the outcomes for abused or neglected children by establishing new formulas that more accurately reflect actual county costs.
These two initiatives combined could generate savings of more than 100 million dollars.
"This budget also reforms the approach we take to increasing payments to hospitals, managed care organizations and nursing homes."
"Since 2002, thirty-two states have frozen or reduced hospital payments, but I am pleased to report that our budget includes a modest increase of 2 percent in payment rates for these providers."
"While twenty-one states froze or reduced managed care payments, we provide a reasonable 2 percent increase in managed care payments."
"Twenty-two states froze or reduced payments to nursing homes, but this budget increases nursing home funding by 2 percent."
"In addition to this rate increase, thanks to the nursing home assessment, facilities will receive annual payments that are about 7 percent above current rates."
"These increases are not as high as providers would want them to be, but they are all that we can safely afford if we want to hold the line on tax increases and maintain our spending in other areas."
"As these reforms make clear, we have chosen to manage the impact of spiraling health-care costs by developing a program that preserves the social safety net while modernizing and eliminating unnecessary or wasteful expenditure of public funds."
"Our intention is to address the rising demand for services – a demand that is skyrocketing all over the Nation and the Commonwealth, in big cities and small towns alike – while limiting its impact on government’s ability to address other important issues like the economy and public education."
"I recognize that these reforms represent change, and that change is always difficult."
"These reforms provide a way to manage this crisis even in the face of continuing reductions in federal support, and they allow us to chart a course for fiscal stability."
The reforms modernize our safety net while preserving it -- that is a solution that works for all of us in Pennsylvania.
"Health care costs are not only busting our budget, they are wreaking havoc in the private sector."
I have witnessed a dramatic shift in the focus of our business leaders over the last 12 months.
"Their number one concern, and rightfully so, is the cost of health care."
"As the cost of health care increases by double digits, legions of businesses are seeing profit margins shrink -- preventing them from creating new jobs or investing in expansion."
"In response to employer concerns that malpractice awards were driving up health insurance costs, this body passed medical malpractice reforms in 2002 and 2003, which are beginning to bring down the cost of malpractice awards and settlements."
Together we stopped the exodus of doctors who considered fleeing Pennsylvania to find relief from rising malpractice insurance costs by passing the MCARE abatement.
"The State Courts, under the leadership of Chief Justice Cappy and the members of the Supreme Court, changed venue rules, required certificates of merit, and imposed guidelines to review jury awards, all of which will reduce malpractice costs even further."
The good news is that for the first time in recent years new companies are offering malpractice insurance policies in Pennsylvania and we have witnessed a 28 percent decline in the number of malpractice suits filed.
But malpractice is only one of the factors driving up our health care bills.
Companies are drowning in bills that are 11 percent higher today than they were last year for their employee health care plans.
Think about it: 11 percent is almost four times the rate of inflation.
And this is the fourth straight year of double-digit increases in health care costs.
"Employees have shared the burden of these increases, as well."
The cost to employees for health insurance has increased by 60 percent since the beginning of the decade.
Currently more than six out of every 10 Pennsylvanians is covered by employer health plans – that’s the good news.
"The bad news is that between 2000 and 2003 close to 700,000 working Pennsylvanians lost their employer-based health insurance coverage."
And this bad news is only getting worse.
"In 2004, fifteen percent of all businesses nationally offered less health care than they did in the previous year."
It is time for us to provide real solutions to the growing health care crisis in Pennsylvania.
I am today proposing that we work together to craft a new program that builds on our Adult Basic safety net package with a goal of at least doubling the number of working Pennsylvanians covered by health insurance and offering many of our small employers a way to keep their good employees from leaving for firms that can afford to provide health care.
"I hope to accomplish this goal by restructuring how we spend our Tobacco Settlement Funds, tapping the Community Health Reinvestment funds from the Blues and by asking our employers to make modest payments toward the health care of the individuals we subsidize through this new program."
"It has been more than five years since the tobacco funds were first made available, and it is time to take a hard look at how we can spend these funds for maximum public benefit."
States across the nation have reallocated tobacco settlement funds in recent years.
Our Tobacco Settlement Fund allocation plan should be adjusted to allow an expansion of health insurance coverage for working Pennsylvanians covered by adultBasic.
But shifting Tobacco Settlement funds does not go far enough.
That is why I am pleased that on Monday I announced an agreement with the four Blue Cross Plans in Pennsylvania.
"Under this agreement, the Blues will allocate $144 million of their funds to the Community Health Reinvestment Fund this year -- we expect that amount to increase annually between now and 2011."
"Sixty percent of these funds can and must be directed toward a new program to expand health insurance to working adults – adding an additional 29,000 working Pennsylvanians to the ranks of the 39,000 already enrolled in the adultBasic health care program."
And any health care solution that provides coverage with public funds must re-engage employers as a partial payers as well.
I believe that it is critical to continue private sector participation in providing health care as a benefit to employees.
"Over the next few months, I have asked the Office of Health Care Reform to work with you and with the private sector to help us design an efficient and sound set of options that expand health insurance coverage to more working Pennsylvanians and keep employers in the game."
We must do more than just address the challenge of meeting the health care needs of hard working Pennsylvanians.
As I said earlier the fastest growing segment of our Medical Assistance recipients are those needing care in nursing homes.
The cost of care for these seniors and disabled adults is also rising faster than the cost of care for any other group of medical assistance recipients.
"Fortunately, Pennsylvania is leading the nation in planning for a Long Term Living system."
The federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services – CMS -- recently designated Pennsylvania as the state it wants to study and highlight in its long-term “living” reform efforts.
In our system we understand the role that a familiar home and a neighbor play in keeping seniors alert and fulfilled in their twilight years.
We can continue to be a beacon among states in caring for older adults -- and we will be.
And so this budget includes a proposal to reallocate Tobacco Settlement Funds to increase the number of older adults who can age at home with community-based care.
"This reallocation will provide the funds to enable 4,000 more seniors and disabled to remain at home and receive care."
"It has been said that “ the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped and those who are in the dawn of life, the children.Let me turn to the children."
"We have far too many children without health insurance – over 130,000."
Yet more than half of these children could be enrolled in our existing publicly funded programs.
And we are actively reaching out to enroll those children.
"This budget provides for enrolling 10,000 more children in our successful CHIP program."
By better program management – not new resources – we can give more children access to health care in the Commonwealth.
"Today, I am introducing a budget that reaffirms our commitment to provide health insurance to children, seniors and those who need health care but cannot afford it."
We have the resources to do this.
All that we need is our collective will to enact the laws necessary to make it happen.
The budget that I introduce today is a product of the real challenges that we face.
It includes tax reform and tax reductions to make our Commonwealth more competitive.
It includes funds for Job Ready Pennsylvania to improve our workforce development system and reform our high schools.
"It also includes continued improvement in the cost-effectiveness of government, both in response to the high cost of health care and other social programs, and as part of our commitment to providing taxpayers with the very best value for every tax dollar."
It meets a one billion dollar budget gap without raising taxes and without turning our back on the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians.
But the budget introduced today also includes difficult choices and it is not without significant pain.
Passing it will require discipline and courage.
The discipline to say no to the temptation of partisan bickering and the courage to say no to special interests that narrow our vision.
The job of governing in Pennsylvania also requires faith.
"Faith that we can, and we will, work as one to address the needs of our fellow citizens."
"I have that faith and you should too, because we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again.Let us begin today."
