SENTENCES
"Speaker Daniels, President Philip, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Constitutional officers, members of the 89th General Assembly and my fellow citizens of Illinois, The state of our state is good.We face many challenges."
But there are many more reasons to be optimistic as we look toward the next few years and the next century.
First and foremost among those reasons is our economy.It is full of vitality today.
"And, even more importantly, a solid, real foundation has been laid for bright tomorrows."
"During the last three years, Illinois has gained more than 300,000 jobs, outpacing every other industrial state."
"Manufacturing jobs in Illinois increased by more than twice the national average, and Illinois exports last year continued a trend of surpassing the nation -- increasing 27 percent during the first three quarters."
Our unemployment rate has been under the national average month after month after month.
"Indeed, our average unemployment rate in 1995 was the lowest in more than two decades."
"And, as we begin this new year and approach the threshold of a new century, the outlook is very positive."
"Recently, Crain's Chicago Business reported on a survey conducted by nationally recognized experts on the economy."
"The survey focused on 114 major metropolitan areas and here's the conclusion reached by the experts: The Chicago metropolitan area will top all the others, except for Atlanta, in job creation as we head into the 21st Century."
More than a quarter of a million new jobs in the Chicago metropolitan area alone.
That forecast confirms what we have seen and sensed throughout Illinois.
Business people throughout our state have been upbeat about our economy.
"But, more importantly, they have demonstrated their confidence in it day after day, expansion after expansion in every corner of Illinois."
Look at what we have seen in only the last few months.
"McDonald's announced a major expansion at its corporate headquarters in Oakbrook, an investment of half a billion dollars that will create as many as 7,000 new good jobs in administration, research and marketing.And then there is Motorola."
"In addition to building a 100-million-dollar production plant in Harvard, Illinois that will employ more than 3,000 people, Motorola revealed a few weeks ago that it will invest another $40 million in a facility at Elgin adding 1500 new jobs to the Illinois economy."
"U. S. Robotics announced it will invest $70 million in facilities at Morton Grove and Mt. Prospect, adding at least 3,000 jobs to the Illinois economy over the next few years."
"And thousands of new jobs will be added throughout the state in the months ahead because of expansions by downstate businesses including Elco Industries in Rockford, Wal-Mart's distribution center in Olney, Magnet in Centralia, Magna Bank in Belleville, John Deere Health Care in the Quad-Cities, Menard's in Plano and GE with an investment of $100 million in its Mattoon lamp manufacturing plant."
The economic development strategy we developed five years ago is paying off.
"With Lieutenant Governor Kustra playing a key role in implementing that strategy, we are providing job training funds and infrastructure improvements."
"But most importantly, we have encouraged Illinois businesses to grow and expand by improving our business climate."
"Last year in particular, we made giant strides by acting to reduce the number of costly and frivolous lawsuits."
Gone at long last are laws that enriched a few lawyers and branded our state as unfriendly to business and job growth.
We also have demonstrated that state regulators and businesses can work together to protect both the environment and the bottom line.
"For example, businesses in the Rockford area were offered the opportunity to avoid fines and penalties and be good citizens by coming forward voluntarily to comply with environmental laws."
More than 60 businesses came forward.
Most of them were small businesses.
"And they saved themselves $600,000 in potential penalties while helping us to protect the environment."
"We are expanding that initiative to cover some 4,000 printing operations and 15,000 auto body shops statewide."
And we are preparing to embark on yet another initiative that will keep us in the vanguard of joint ventures with the private sector to protect our environment.
"In an innovative approach that promises to become a model for the nation, 3M and very likely several other companies will join with state regulators to develop more cost-effective ways that business can comply with environmental laws."
"Day after day, we are sending the right signals to businesses within Illinois and throughout the world that are deciding where to make their next job-creating investment."
Soon we will become the first state in the nation to electronically link the business and economic expertise that we offer with a major information source for manufacturers on the World Wide Web.
"That source is the Thomas Register, the Bible of the manufacturing world when it comes to purchasing and engineering."
"When it goes up on the World Wide Web in March, it will feature technical and economic assistance available in Illinois."
"Our 25,000 manufacturers will have easy access to assistance from Illinois universities, community colleges, laboratories and industrial organizations."
"The initiative also will attract new industry and more jobs to Illinois by publicizing the expertise and skilled workers readily available from our universities and colleges, Argonne, Fermilab and other institutions."
"And, with the support of this legislature, we can make Illinois even more attractive to business expansion and job growth."
"Today, I am proposing that we reduce unemployment insurance taxes for each and every employer in Illinois, from the largest to the smallest."
"If you agree to that cut, employers will be paying over $200 million less in taxes next year."
The unemployment insurance trust fund has a healthy surplus.
"And I want to see those dollars used for even more investment, more expansion and more job creation in Illinois, instead of sitting idle in a government account."
I also want employers and organized labor to work toward improving our unemployment insurance program and our worker's compensation system.
We in state government will continue our efforts to make it more effective and efficient by streamling and downsizing.
"Because of those efforts, state government is in far better fiscal shape than it was in 1991, when a new Governor and many of you in this chamber began making tough decisions and showing the discipline necessary to live within our means."
We've restored the fiscal health of our state employees health insurance program.
"Our Medicaid backlog has been slashed by about $800 million, meaning that those who provide health care to the poor are being paid more quickly."
And we are delivering more service with less bureaucracy.
"Last year, you concurred in my initiative to streamline and focus our efforts to protect, preserve and promote natural resources."
We reduced bureaucratic overhead by replacing three Cabinet departments with one.
"Today I am proposing additional streamlining, this time in delivery of services to the truly needy and in regulation of financial institutions."
"I am recommending that we establish a Department of Human Services to provide services now being provided by seven different agencies all with their own budget offices, their own personnel offices, their own legal staffs, their own communications offices and their own programs."
We cannot afford to tackle the significant challenges we face with separate and overlapping bureaucracies and services that sometimes duplicate each other.
"In the next few weeks, we will reach out to those who receive and provide services as we finalize how to most effectively implement the reorganization."
But there is no question in my mind this streamlining will reduce bureaucracy.
"And it will help us take full advantage of the greater flexibility we expect to receive from Washington in using federal dollars, flexibility that will allow for more innovation in state Capitols and communities throughout the nation instead of more and more long-distance social engineering in the nation's capital."
"Services to troubled children and troubled families, services to those with mental illness or mental disabilities, services to those with physical disabilities, services for alcoholism and substance abuse, services to senior citizens -- all will be better targeted and better coordinated with less administrative cost under the reorganization I want this legislature to approve."
I also am proposing today that we combine two Cabinet departments that regulate banks and savings and loans.
"So if you concur with the proposals I am making today, we will have nine fewer Cabinet departments than just two years ago."
"And by downsizing agencies along with taking other actions to make us more efficient, we will have reduced the number of state employees under my jurisdiction by several thousand."
We will have done so while adding hundreds and hundreds of caseworkers to address the explosion of child abuse and neglect and while adding hundreds and hundreds of prison guards to staff the additional prisons we have brought on line to keep dangerous people safely behind bars.
"Not more government, better government."
I am proud that the Department of Children and Family Services is now working much more closely with the Chicago Police Department and the Cook County court system so all three can respond more effectively to child abuse and neglect.
It didn't take millions of dollars in new programs to bring about that greatly improved cooperation.
"It took a commitment by my special counsel for child welfare services and representatives of DCFS, the police and the courts to sit down, talk and act."
"We will continue to make improvements in other areas, often using new technology."
This spring we will make it easier for teachers to apply for and receive their teachers certificates.
A process that now takes weeks or months will take only moments when it is done via computers at the regional superintendents' offices.
We also will make it easier than ever to file income tax returns.
"Seven out of every 10 income tax payers who prepare their own returns will be able to file by telephone, get any refunds they have coming earlier and not worry about sending us paper."
"In addition, the Department of Revenue will use interactive television to promote more fairness in the property tax system by training assessors to do a more professional job."
"Not more government, better government."
"Meanwhile, we have been moving ahead on other fronts."
"Last year, we accomplished what very few believed could be accomplished -- real reform of the Chicago school system."
"Real reform that has been hailed as a model for troubled, metropolitan school districts across the nation."
"And we empowered local schools, not only in Chicago but throughout Illinois, to make improvements without being stymied by a Springfield-knows-best mentality and all the bureaucratic red tape that goes along with it."
I want to congratulate the leadership in Chicago for using the new flexibility and powers we gave them to make extremely positive changes in the system.
Now I want to continue empowering school districts elsewhere in Illinois by allowing them similar flexibility in using funds given them for a variety of purposes.
Let those districts and not Springfield decide on how best to spend those state funds.
"And, as we give that additional flexibility to school districts throughout the state, let us pave the way for even more innovation by empowering communities throughout the state to establish charter schools."
We would demand that charter schools meet high standards but we give them almost total freedom to determine how to meet those standards.
"Free to be bold, free to innovate, free to break from the timeworn practices of the past, they would become greenhouses for school reform that could be transplanted ultimately to schools throughout Illinois."
Both the House and the Senate have approved legislation to establish charter schools but for technical reasons there has been no agreement on the same bill.
Come to agreement this year in this session.
Let's bring charter schools to Illinois.
I also want to explore the possibility of additional school reform in Chicago.
"I am asking Lieutenant Governor Kustra, who has been my point man on Chicago school reform, to spearhead an initiative that could lead to residential academies -- boarding schools in inner-city areas for parents and foster parents to send kids who have been disadvantaged or are struggling in traditional schools."
Lieutenant Governor Kustra also has played a key role in our drive to bring technology to every classroom in our state.
"The World Wide Web is opening great new avenues of opportunity, new worlds of information for all those who navigate its many wonders."
There is no speed limit on that information highway.
There is no limit to what students and the rest of us can learn from its pages.
But our students must have access to it.
They must have the hardware that supports the rapidly changing technology.
Technology can be one of the great equalizers of educational opportunities across Illinois.
"Or, unchecked and unguided, it can widen the gap between affluent and poor school districts."
"I want to make sure that technology helps every student in Illinois, no matter where he or she goes to school."
"In some schools, students in kindergarten are already learning to use the mouse as well as the crayon."
"And when we fulfill our goal of having every school in Illinois on-line, the Internet will replace the encyclopedia."
I am announcing today the state will build a statewide network .
We will run a high-tech T-One line into every one of the 903 school districts in Illinois and then pay for the ongoing line charges for that equipment.
We also will invest more resources in teaching our teachers.
"We will expand the number of regional training centers operated by the State Board of Education, showing teachers how to better integrate technology into the learning process in a more meaningful way."
"We are building classrooms without walls, classrooms where wealth and geographic location do not define educational achievement and classrooms that will enable our students to lead and not lag behind."
"But as high tech allows our young people to explore new worlds of learning, we cannot allow the violence of the outside world to invade the playgrounds and corridors of our schools."
Children must feel safe and be safe in their schools.
"It's no secret to any of us today that the attraction of a quick buck from selling drugs has brought violent street gangs to every neighborhood of Illinois, and too often that violence has spilled into the classrooms and playgrounds."
"Several months ago, we enacted legislation launching a violence prevention initiative headed by the attorney general."
It will bolster community efforts that can make a significant difference.
I also commend the attorney general and the state board of education for their work to make our schools safer.
"Among other things, they are committed to providing safe transportation for students who must walk through dangerous areas of the inner city to school."
And I urge this General Assembly to fund the State Board's proposal encouraging school districts to set up high-discipline alternative schools for the most disruptive of their students.
"But, even as we focus on the violence that cheats too many of our young people of their potential and the high tech that promises to increase the potential of millions and millions of our young people, I am optimistic that we can move forward in this session on another front that greatly impacts their future."
"For decades, our system of funding elementary and secondary education has been under attack, for good reason I believe."
It has been and continues to be unfair and uneven.
"There is a lack of equity where tax dollars support a pupil in one district by $4,000, and a pupil in another district right next door is supported by more than $10,000."
"And I'll say again, what I've said many times for many years throughout this state: We rely too heavily on property taxes to fund education in Illinois."
It is time to squarely address these issues.
And I am optimistic you and I can do so during this legislative session.
"Soon, we will have recommendations from a commission headed by former University of Illinois president Stan Ikenberry."
"When I established this task force last year, some were skeptical.I understand that."
We've had numerous commissions study school funding.
But I am confident this commission will give recommendations that we can accept and move on.
"First, it has an outstanding chairman who demonstrated as the president of a world class university that he knows how to get things done for the benefit of young people."
"Secondly, Stan Ikenberry is just one of many distinguished, action-oriented members of this commission.Thirdly, my charge was clear.We don't want another study.We want an action plan."
We want a plan that is realistic and politically doable.
"I realize that legislative sessions in even-number years, like this one are generally limited to fashioning a budget."
"I'm all for fashioning a good budget and doing it early, just like last year."
"But the Ikenberry commission will make its recommendations in just a couple of months, and I am very hopeful that we can endorse and embrace those recommendations before the final gavel falls on this session."
We also must build on our efforts to reform welfare.
"While Washington has debated, debated, debated and deadlocked on welfare reform, we have acted in Springfield."
Our state has been in the forefront of transforming a welfare system that focused on dependence to a welfare-to-work system that focuses on independence.
We encourage and no longer penalize welfare recipients who want to take temporary jobs.
We encourage and no longer penalize fathers who want to stay with their families.
"Our Earnfare program, which recently won a national award for innovation from the Council of State Governments, provides thousands and thousands of former welfare recipients with work, a pay check and pride."
Teenaged mothers 18 and under are being required to pursue their education while on welfare so we can help them move off of welfare.
"In 1995, you and I built on those reforms by requiring AFDC mothers with older children to seek and hold down jobs and holding parents accountable when children in the elementary grades are not in school regularly."
"And for this session of the General Assembly, I am proposing that you approve legislation so we can start requiring recipients with alcohol and drug problems to undergo treatment."
"At the same time, we must press ahead with our fresh approach to dealing more effectively and efficiently with disadvantaged and troubled children and families."
"In my first State of the State, back in 1991, I asked you to help me launch Project Success."
The concept was relatively simple.
"If a child shows up to school malnourished or is upset over family problems, that child is going to have difficulty learning."
So help should be readily accessible once a teacher or counselor has spotted the problem.
We spend billions of dollars each year on services for children.
There was no need to spend billions or even millions more.
What we did through Project Success was to better coordinate and focus state and community services.
And we asked community leaders to help us develop and implement the program.
"We began, under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Kustra, by testing Project Success in six neighborhoods in the state."
"Now, Project Success is found in 130 communities working with 400 elementary schools throughout our state, with the goal of eventually expanding it statewide, and the program has impressed business leaders interested in improving education and the quality of life in their communities."
"For example, Kraft Foods committed funds for Project Success in eight communities when it became a corporate sponsor in 1994."
"Last year, Kraft Foods tripled its support."
Project Success has become a model for the nation.
And what had been launched as an initiative to improve learning in our schools also has become an inspiration for much broader human services reform right here in Illinois.
The question is not whether we're going to help disadvantaged children and their families.
The question is how we're going to help them.
"The Casey Foundation, a nationally recognized innovator in the human services area, liked our willingness to innovate and to make better use of existing services."
"So, in 1994, the foundation gave us a 2.5 million dollar grant to launch a one-stop shopping initiative as a fresh sensible approach to delivering human services effectively, efficiently and compassionately."
Troubled families often need services that cannot be supplied by a single state or community agency.
"We found that too often they have difficulty obtaining services and when they do, there is duplication, confusion and conflicting approaches from different agencies dealing with the same families."
"So, with the help of the Casey Foundation, we are testing a brand new approach in five communities throughout Illinois."
"In those communities, just as in Project Success, the people closest to the problems are being empowered.Neighbors.Community groups.Churches and synagogues.Civic and business leaders.Local officials."
They are custom-tailoring and implementing remedies that they believe will work in their communities.
"As a result, state and local resources are being better coordinated, more strategically targeted and more effectively utilized."
The one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work nationally.
And it doesn't and won't work in the State of Illinois.
I have discouraged and vetoed state mandates on local government.I will continue to do so.
And we will be putting more and more resources into community-based programs in mental health and in human resources because I believe strongly in community and neighborhood empowerment.
"I also believe strongly, as this General Assembly does, in making and keeping communities and neighborhoods safe."
"Fifteen months ago, we enacted the most sweeping and tough anti-crime package in decades."
We followed that last year by enacting landmark truth-in-sentencing legislation.
"Simply put, those who commit violent crimes not punishable by death will be spending all or most of their life in prison."
But we did not stop with the truth-in-sentencing law.
Being implemented as I speak is a law that enables law enforcement officers to alert citizens of a community when a sex offender moves into their midst.
This year I want to bolster our anti-crime efforts in another important area.
I will be asking for funds to increase the number of parole agents in Illinois.
That will allow us to build on an initiative to overhaul a traditional parole system that has not been effective in keeping ex-prisoners from returning to a life of crime and ultimately to prison.
"I have heard some imply and even assert that there is a correlation between the number of parole agents, the violent crime rate and the number of repeat offenders."
But there is absolutely no documentation of that --none-- despite all the demagoguery from vote-hungry politicians and headline-hungry newspaper reporters.
Checking in with a parole agent from time to time never has gotten the job done and never will.
What we have launched and are building upon in Illinois is a program that recognizes that prisoners will become repeat offenders if they lack the job skills and the opportunity to be employed and if they resume drug habits that got them into trouble in the first place.
"Under this program, called Pre-Start, parole agents begin working with prisoners before they leave prison."
Many then receive very special attention when they are released.
"This approach has been studied by experts at Southern Illinois University, who believe we are on the right track, and that we should invest more of our resources in it."
"So that's what we will do, with your support."
"We will expand Pre-Start by opening three centers in the Chicago area where released offenders will be required to participate in programs such as substance abuse treatment and to attend classes on job training, parenting, life skills and violence reduction."
The centers also will be active in helping to find jobs for the released offenders.
"In addition, we will expand the Community Intervention Program, an initiative that has proven successful with released offenders who have had serious substance abuse problems."
"And, if you approve the funding for this initiative, we will hire an additional 32 parole agents who will be deployed as part of our efforts to significantly increase our supervision of sex offenders."
I also want to shore up our efforts in another area of public safety.
"On October 25, all of us were jolted by the deaths of seven young people and injuries to 30 others when a train slammed into a school bus at Fox River Grove."
I immediately directed the state Department of Transportation to investigate and to make recommendations.
One of its findings was that there was no single state agency ultimately accountable for safety at rail crossings.
It also determined that information on potential danger spots was scattered.
"Today, I am asking you to send me legislation to make one agency, the Illinois Commerce Commission, accountable for railroad safety ."
The ICC will work closely with the state Department of Transportation and local officials to assure that our safety efforts at rail crossings are well-coordinated.
We also will establish a central source for all information that can alert us to problems at rail crossings.
And I have directed the Department of Transportation to develop a state-of-the-art warning system that will trigger a loud and clear alarm to a bus driver in the bus itself that a train is approaching.
We must do all we can to keep another Fox River Grove tragedy from happening again.
I also am asking this legislature to act quickly in the next few days to set the speed limit on county and township roads at 55 miles per hour as local governments have requested.
"Under current state law, the limit went from 55 to 65 automatically when the federal government got out of the speed limit business."
"So now we need a change in state law to do what is right for traffic safety, and I am confident you will give this matter the urgent attention it requires."
Motorists may save a few minutes with a 65 miles per hour limit on two-lane roads.
But saving minutes is not worth losing lives.
I also will seek favorable action from this Legislature on still other fronts.
We need to assure that Illinois workers can keep their health insurance if they change or lose their jobs.
And we need to expand coverage to other workers by making it easier for their employers to band together and obtain insurance at affordable prices.
I sent you legislation to accomplish those goals last year and the year before.
"Occasionally, I've had to wait a while to see an important State of the State initiative become law."
"Workers and Illinois have waited long enough for this health insurance reform, and I hope this legislature enacts it this year."
I also want you to do what is right and responsible by approving legislation that will allow us to maintain and expand infrastructure and buildings throughout Illinois.
"Last year, partisan politics prevented this legislature, for the first time in anyone's memory, from authorizing expenditures for capital improvements."
We are not being efficient if we don't do the upkeep in our buildings now that is necessary to head off far more costly expenditures in the future.
"It is time for the obstructionists in this legislature to pick other partisan fights instead of this one, which is so important to efficient and responsible government."
I also want you to tighten provisions enacted late last year to allow employers to monitor conversations of their employees.
"The legislation, which was sent to me in a bill that dealt with many important matters, went farther than its stated purpose."
"It should be changed to apply strictly to the telemarketing industry, which sought the bill so it could monitor the sales performance of its employees."
I also want you to repeal another law that has provided taxpayer subsidies for those who construct and operate incinerators.
Most communities do not want the incinerators.
And it is time we stop asking our taxpayers to subsidize them.
We should also reform our riverboat tax structure.
"All but a couple of riverboats in Illinois are making their owners and investors extremely wealthy, tripling even the most optimistic forecasts made when the riverboat legislation was approved in 1990."
"I believe it is only fair that we channel more of those receipts toward the benefit of all Illinoisans and use it to fund worthwhile programs, like the health insurance program for retired teachers which the legislature approved without funding last year."
"A year ago, I stood at this podium and issued an ambitious call to action."
"Inspired by its new leadership, this legislature responded to that call and other challenges in unprecedented fashion."
I salute those in this chamber today who joined with me in moving Illinois forward on many fronts.You went to work immediately.
You and I worked closely together.And we got the job done.
We agreed upon a budget a full month before the beginning of the fiscal year.No impasse.No deadlock.No nonsense.
I look forward to working with you in the same fashion during this session for the good of the people we all serve.
Things aren't perfect in state government and in the State of Illinois.They never will be.
"But too often we read, hear and talk only about what is wrong, not what is right."
"Too many of our people are still unemployed but there are 5.8 million Illinois men and women working in our factories, on our farms and in our retail outlets, the highest number ever on record."
Too many of our people are still impoverished and dependent.
"But thousands of former welfare recipients have demonstrated that they can achieve independence through reforms like Earnfare, if they are given motivation and opportunity."
We need better results out of many classrooms in our state.
"But in most classrooms of our state, young people are getting an education today that is much better than the one we received, an education that will open new vistas and will help them to compete effectively well into the 21st Century."
The outrage of child abuse sickens us day after day.
"And we can't tolerate the tragic slaughter of young people, whether it's abuse from parents or boy friends, whether it's gang warfare or other senseless violence."
"But I sense a revival of community, a revival of neighborhood in many of the communities that have lived with these atrocities day after day, month after month, year after year."
They are reclaiming their communities and neighborhoods.
"And we're going to help them with new approaches rooted in the old but timeless values of community, neighborhood, parental commitment and personal responsibility, decency and humanity."
"As I have traveled around Illinois, my faith in our people and in our future has grown."
"The best in us will prevail, as it always has, with Illinois' best and brightest."
"For example, with us in the Gallery today are two of Illinois' most decorated military heroes, winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, who I would like to stand and be recognized now.The best in us will prevail."
And I look forward to working with people in all corners of Illinois and with this legislature to build on our strengths and to meet our challenges.
"Together, we will ensure that the best of Illinois prevails."
"Together, we will make the great state of Illinois an even greater state for our children and their children and for generations to come."
