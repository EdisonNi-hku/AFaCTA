SENTENCES
I'm pleased to be able to join you today to discuss the state of the state.
"Due to a recent change in my life, I have had a lot of time in the relative quiet of the middle of the night to think about that very topic."
"And because of that change, better known as my son Logan, I have more cause than ever to think not just about the state of the state, but about the future of the state."
"For as long as I can remember, I have had a deep personal commitment to Oregon."
For the past two decades I have served this state in public office.
"But until I became a father, I'm not sure I fully realized the staggering responsibility I have -- not only as governor, and not only as a parent, but as a member of the Oregon community -- to contribute to and help create the kind of state I want my son to grow up in."
It is a responsibility we all have.
And I believe we are starting from a position of strength.
"One of the things that has always defined Oregon has been our ability to do great things -- to lead the way, to find new approaches."
And the reason is that we Oregonians have historically viewed our problems as shared responsibilities.
We have worked together to find solutions.
"Somewhere within each of us -- flickering maybe, but not extinguished -- there burns a sense of community which has enabled us to achieve things that others might have called impossible."
"The landmarks of our recent history -- the Oregon Beach Bill, the Oregon Bottle Bill, the Oregon Health Plan, and now the Oregon Salmon and Watershed Restoration Plan -- all reflect the deepest values and the highest priorities -- not of government, but of the people collectively."
The values and priorities of the Oregon community.
"When I look around the state today at some of the things we have accomplished, I do see many signs of a bright future."
Our economy is strong and diverse.
Incomes are rising and unemployment is low.
More Oregonians today have health care than ever before.
The number of children without health insurance has dropped from 21 percent to less than eight percent.
We have dramatically reduced the number of Oregonians on welfare.
And we have launched an historic endeavor to restore watersheds across the state based on the commitment of thousands of Oregonians who have volunteered to work on their local streams and rivers.
All of these accomplishments point to a future for Oregon's children that we can feel good about.
None of them could have been accomplished by government alone; they required individual responsibility and community involvement as well.
"But as remarkable as they are, they are only part of the picture.Many challenges remain."
The challenge of helping our students achieve the high academic standards we have set for them.
The challenge of reducing juvenile crime.
The challenge of managing growth in a way that preserves our exceptional quality of life.
"The challenge of continuing to restore streams and watersheds throughout the state, including the Willamette River."
I believe we can meet all of these challenges -- if we approach them the way we have tackled problems in the past.
"And the fact is, we know what works."
"We know that Oregon has always worked best and accomplished most when it has functioned not as a collection of separate people or groups or interests or institutions, but as one community -- diverse, but united in pursuit of common goals."
"Yet today, like a cloud on the bright horizon of our future, this sense of community and shared responsibility is giving way to a widening breach among individual citizens and between Oregonians and their government -- a growing tendency to think not in terms of community, but in terms of ""us vs. them"" -- a growing unwillingness to see our problems as shared responsibilities."
On a number of issues vital to our future I believe individuals have become disengaged -- in the hope that their government can solve problems without them.
Juvenile crime offers a concrete example.
It clearly is a state problem -- and a very serious one.
"But it is also a community problem, because these crimes affect the lives of individual citizens -- our own neighbors, friends and families."
"Three years ago, in an effort to address this problem, Oregonians passed Ballot Measure 11."
"In response, we will spend more than $1 billion in the next 10 years just building 13,000 new jail and prison beds."
We will spend millions more running them.
"Yet despite this enormous expenditure of public funds -- which has come primarily out of education -- Oregon is not, in fact, a safer place."
In Portland alone last year there was a record number of gang-related homicides.
This irony was brought home to me a couple weeks ago by a juvenile homicide in Boston which made the national news.
Why would a juvenile homicide in Boston make the national news?
Because it was the first gun-related killing of a juvenile in Boston in 29 months.
Twenty-nine months -- almost two and a half years.
"By comparison, in the last two years alone there have been six gun-related juvenile murders in Portland."
"While we've been building prisons, Boston police have been teaming up with social service agencies, community groups, churches, and neighborhoods to target and directly intervene with at-risk kids and offer them alternatives to lives of crime."
"While jails and prisons are certainly necessary, it is equally necessary to prevent crimes before they happen -- and that takes the kind of community involvement we are seeing in Boston."
"I share this with you because it highlights what we already know here in Oregon -- that real solutions require not only state leadership, but community involvement and individual responsibility."
We cannot simply hand problems off to the state.
"Because that is another way of saying, ""this is no longer my responsibility."
But Oregon's challenges are our responsibilities -- individually and collectively.
"Oregonians should know, better than anyone else, that unless problems like crime and education and growth and protecting our environment become not just state problems, but community problems -- unless individual Oregonians work together as a community -- we are not going to achieve the kind of future we all hope to have."
"And I do believe that we share a common vision of the future -- not something abstract and intangible, but something involving real conditions that touch the everyday lives of real people -- especially our children."
"Speaking for myself -- not only as governor, but as an Oregonian, and now as a father -- I can describe for you the vision of the state I want for my son Logan and for every child in Oregon."
"I want our children to be able to spend their early years in an environment where they can be healthy and safe -- an environment that fosters a sense of security and self-worth, and that opens their minds to what's best in the world -- the wonder and beauty of nature and of books, laughter, family, friends, and strong but simple values like compassion and responsibility."
"When they enter school, I want them to be ready to learn."
I want them to go to schools where the teachers have time to deal with each student as an individual with particular needs.
I want classrooms with good textbooks and up-to-date technology.
"I want courses in art and music, and vocational courses for those who are interested."
I want my son and his fellow students to travel to and from school on roads that are safe because they are in good repair and not clogged with congestion.
"I want them to be able to visit parks and public libraries, to fish in unpolluted streams and hike in mountains and forests that look pretty much the way they did when I was young."
"When they enter high school, I want my son and his friends to be ready to achieve the high performance standards we have set for them."
I want them to go to schools where they won't have to be checked for concealed weapons and where they won't be tempted to use drugs or to join gangs in order to attain social acceptance.
"And when they graduate, I want them to have all the tools they will need to move on, whether to a job or to college."
That is the kind of future I want for my son and for every Oregon child.
"And I believe it is a shared vision, something all of us want.How can we get there?"
"Not expecting someone else to do it for us, but only by rekindling the sense of community and individual responsibility that have illuminated our past and which alone can light our future.We know what we want.We know what works."
"It is only a question of each of us -- as members of the diverse, caring, creative and energetic community we call Oregon -- doing our part."
"So now let me turn to four of the major challenges we will face in making our vision a reality: achieving high educational standards, managing growth, reducing juvenile crime and preserving the quality of our environment."
"I want to describe what I will do to provide leadership in these areas, and what I expect of you in terms of community involvement and individual responsibility."
"First, our vision includes a future where all Oregon children have equal access to an education that will prepare them to succeed in the 21st Century."
"The new, higher educational standards we have established put us on that path."
But success will take more than high standards and adequate funding.
It will also require that we reconnect our communities to their schools -- something we lost when Ballot Measure 5 turned the problem of school funding over to state government.
Our challenge is to restore that involvement and ownership.
"As a citizen, I intend to lead by example, regularly spending time reading to children in the classroom, mentoring or serving as a classroom volunteer."
"I have already started an extensive series meetings throughout Oregon with parents, teachers, community leaders and school administrators -- to find ways to help people get involved with their schools."
I am looking for programs and strategies that have worked.
I am asking what the schools need tomorrow that they don't have today to help our children meet the standards and I intend to use this information to create a link between the next budget and student performance.
I challenge all of you to make a similar commitment to these youngest of Oregonians.
"Get into schools, communicate directly with the teachers and administrators and be actively involved in your child's education."
"Whether you have children in school or not, try to find ways to expose students to the workplace so they can connect what they are learning with the real world outside the classroom."
"And I call on all Oregonians, to reach out to those children whose parents may be working two jobs just to keep food on the table, who don't have time to read to their kids or help them with their homework or give them proper guidance."
Because educating our children is a shared responsibility.
"Second, our vision includes a future of congestion-free roadways, of open spaces and balanced, quality communities."
Success will depend on managing growth in a way that preserves our exceptional quality of life.
And that will require both state leadership and community involvement.Let me give you an example.
"Corvallis, like the tri-county area, is currently grappling with the problems created by success: a growing number of jobs and people to fill those jobs -- but no place in the community for those people to live."
I recently met with community leaders in Corvallis who told me that increasingly people are living in nearby Lebanon and Albany where the affordable housing is located.
These towns are now filling up with people who work in Corvallis.
"The result is a forced commute to the workplace, congested roads and pressure to spend millions of dollars on highway improvements -- millions which, by the way, we don't have."
I believe this and similar problems around the state could be avoided if communities looked beyond their boundaries and thought about growth as a regional issue.
I am not talking about creating another level of government.
But I am simply suggesting that we need to create some appropriate forum for regions to plan cooperatively for growth.
I am already working to bring regions together to solve the problems that growth is bringing us.
"In this region you already have a forum to do this -- Metro -- which recognizes that you don't have three separate counties up here as much as you have a common metropolitan area, and that you cannot plan for and manage growth without coordinated, region-wide decisions."
I realize that Metro has come under fire from some quarters -- and no one will argue that its governmental functions cannot be improved.
"I urge you to make Metro work better, yes ."
but do not throw out this landmark effort to plan for and shape your own future.
I sympathize with the desire to preserve neighborhoods and we must support neighborhood efforts to maintain and restore their sense of community.
But we must also understand that ultimately our community is much larger than our immediate neighborhood.
"Growth must be addressed as a neighborhood, city, county and a regional issue.It is a shared responsibility."
"Third, our vision includes a future where Oregon citizens are safe -- in their homes, on the streets, and in our schools."
"The state government can build and operate prisons, and it is doing so, but we won't be truly safe until Oregonians are willing to demand of their legislature an investment in prevention that is at least as serious as the investment we are making in punishment."
Nor will our communities ever be truly safe unless those within the community reach out and help support families and especially children at risk -- unless they participate not only in neighborhood watch but also in the boys and girls club.
Make no mistake: the social problems our neglected and deprived kids bring to school have an impact on every other child and on our entire education system and our whole society.
In the coming year I will make the support of community-based juvenile crime prevention my top public safety priority.
"And if we could spend just a fraction of what we spend on punishment, helping kids who need help the most, then I am convinced we can begin to turn the tide of juvenile crime."
"We will stop these kids from hurting others, but equally important we will keep them from ruining and wasting their own lives."
We know who these high risk kids are.
And we all know what will happen to them -- and to us -- if they are ignored.
And I am convinced that caring and intervention at the community level can do what no government program can ever hope to accomplish.
This too is a shared responsibility.
"Fourth, our vision includes a natural environment marked by clean waterways and healthy fish habitat."
I will spend the next year working to make the Oregon Salmon and Watershed Restoration Plan a success.
I will also lead the effort to restore the health of the Willamette River by implementing the recommendations of the Willamette River Basin Task Force.
Both efforts are based on a philosophy which I deeply embrace -- that we can accomplish more for our environment -- and for our sense of community -- by helping people do the right thing than by simply punishing them for their past practices; that we will accomplish more for a watershed when a community has made it a priority than when the state has made it a mandate.
"As people lucky enough to live in this beautiful state, you must also play your part by managing your life in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on the environment."
"If you live by a stream, allow plants to grow beside it.Reduce erosion."
Reduce your use of yard fertilizers and pesticides.
Watch what you put down the sink or into the storm drain.
Become a participant in your local watershed council or soil and water conservation district.
Work with the appropriate agency to develop and implement a management plan for your basin and your farm.Recycle.Conserve water.Conserve energy.Reduce waste.
Protecting and preserving our environment is a shared responsibility.
I believe that if each of us does our part no one's burden will be too heavy to bear.
And the rewards will belong to us all.
Clearly I am asking much of Oregonians.But much is needed.
The easy path is to look at our present prosperity and reckon that the future doesn't need tending.
"But that is not the case -- just as you cannot bring into the world a healthy, normal child and just assume that his or her future is assured, with no more effort or responsibility on your part.The same applies to Oregon."
Our great inheritance -- a beautiful state with a distinguished history of civic involvement and civic accomplishment -- was made possible by men and women who did not take the future for granted.
It was made possible by people who never questioned the principle that individuals with ideas can make a difference.
It was made possible by Oregonians who had the determination to put those ideas into practice.
"And it was made possible by people who loved Oregon enough to get involved -- to take responsibility for meeting the challenges before our state -- and in so doing, met them."
I refuse to believe that those people no longer exist.
"I refuse to believe that Oregonians today are unwilling to help children learn, unwilling to keep children from turning to lives of crime, unwilling to help our communities grow well, unwilling to keep our streams and rivers clean."
"Instead, I believe that we are as capable today as we have ever been of solving our problems and meeting our challenges."
I believe that the spirit of community which made Oregon great burns as brightly today as it ever has.
"And that if we work together, no dream will lie beyond our grasp."
"American novelist James Agee once wrote that in every child who is born, no matter in what circumstances and no matter of what parents -- the potential of the human race is born again."
"Let us each do our part to ensure that the state of Oregon and the community of Oregon remain, for us and for our children, the best place in the world to live."
