sentences
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor Hillard, members of the Joint Republican and Democrat Leadership and you Ladies and Gentlemen of the House and Senate, and my fellow citizens of South Dakota.
It is really not just the responsibility but it is also the privilege of a Governor to have the opportunity to come before the Legislature on its first day to discuss the state of the state.
Given the fact that my friend, George Bush, when he was in Japan, brought back with him whatever he had over there, this is going to be an abbreviated speech today, which was probably planned by some of you.
As I have the privilege of coming before you today, I can tell you that just like each and every one of you Ladies and Gentlemen that had a contested election--whether you be a Constitutional Officer, a Senator, or a Representative--every single one of us has been out there over the course of the last year talking to voters, talking to taxpayers, talking to retired people, talking to working men and women, talking to students who really have aspirations about fulfilling what we know to be the American dream, and generally just talking to what we call citizens of South Dakota who truly, truly want to have the opportunity to make this into the place that we tell the rest of the world that it is.
"I can recall one day about two weeks before the election when I was stopped in one of the counties by a Highway Patrolman--one of those rare instances when that happened--and the Highway Patrolman said, as he was writing out this document he was writing out, ""Mr. Janklow, I don't think you have it right."
We'd like you to drive 55 but get the state going 85 miles an hour.
As I traveled across the state, and in the meetings that I've had since, I can tell you that I join you in understanding this was a watershed year in America--tremendous upheaval on the national stage when it came to the results of the votes being counted.
Forgetting the partisanship aspect to it, I can tell you we all understand the American people have said we are not willing, we are not tolerating, and we are not going to allow elected representative government to do business as usual like it has come to do it.
In South Dakota, 84.7 percent of every eligible man or woman that was registered to vote or could have registered to vote was registered.
South Dakota was number one in the nation again this year in the percentage of its registered voters that voted.
In the kids' voting project in the schools, which was a new thing that took place in America this year, South Dakota kids were not only number one in the nation, they led the number two state by more than 12 percent, in terms of the percentage of them that voted.
We had hotly contested issues also in South Dakota this year other than personalities and Republicans and Democrats and the Libertarians.
This year, we had the video lottery on the ballot.
And when all the dust settled and the votes were counted, 52.8 percent voted to retain the measure that was on the ballot.
The seat belt law, after all the dust settled with that, 51.24 percent voted in favor of retaining that law that had been passed.
On the property tax issue that was before the people of this state, again, once the dust all settled, 50.55 percent voted for the defeat of that initiative.
None of these can you call a mandate.
All of them you can call the results of, obviously, a very close election.
You know, as we look at the state of the state in South Dakota, you always basically come back to a few basic things.
Because the things that government does really haven't changed since South Dakota came into statehood.
At different times, different issues bubble to the surface of significant consequence and importance--but those issues are always floating around in that water at any given point in time with the ability to bubble to the surface.
We in South Dakota have to really accelerate our economic development.
I don't say that in any critical way, but we recognize that amongst our 300-plus towns and cities, we're not going to be able--and our local communities are not going to be able--to grow in every instance.
Some of them will honestly continue to decline, but as they continue to decline, they will do it with people who've chosen to live out their lives in those communities.
So, there are basic, essential, qualitative services that are necessary that have to be delivered to those citizens.
The phrase of more and better jobs is something that we have to really give substance to.
When we talk about more and better jobs, each and every one of us--and I guarantee you, it doesn't know political boundaries--each and every one of us has a responsibility to make sure that every single course taught in our schools is a course that gives our students the ability to be a world-class student.
Each and every course that's offered and major that's offered in post-secondary academic education and post-secondary vocational education have to be courses that are structured in such a way that we make sure that our young people or our people--because what used to be called nontraditional students are becoming the traditional students--but make sure that our people all are in a position where, once they get their diploma or their certificate or their recognition, really have the tools to go out and compete.
Our goal is $10- and $20-an-hour jobs, but we have to give our people $10- and $20-an-hour skills.
No politician has the right, of any persuasion including Bill Janklow, none of us have the right to give rhetoric about how great everything is if we are not making sure that we are truly equipping our people who want to be so equipped with the skills to go out and get that better economic life.
We are going to create within the Governor's Office of Economic Development the Office of Rural Development.
It is not a big deal in terms of governmental structure, but we are actually going to put people in place whose primary function is to work with the smaller communities in South Dakota and work with them as they assess, through the Gold program or other programs, their needs, their desires, their goals, and their aspirations in order to help them bring forth development that's conducive and structurally possible within the framework of those communities.
I can tell you that we will never have the money, ever, as you all know, to compete with most of the rest of the states in the Union in terms of what we can buy to bring business here.
We don't have that kind of wealth.
The City of Duluth, Minnesota, has almost more money available than the state government of South Dakota for economic development.
I don't say that critically.
What I am saying is, we have to do it with a greater effort, and we have to do it with more focus, and we have to do it with more direction, and we've got to do it with more energy.
Because as I said at the Inaugural Address and as we talked about on the campaign trail, where we used to be hicks from the sticks, we can be the modem cowboys of the year 2000 and beyond if we want to seize the opportunity.
The electronic age, the information age has made it so there is no place, absolutely no place, that is outback or too far away from the markets or too far away from the customers.
We are going to ask that the Legislature fix, once and for all, on a contemporary basis, the Workman's Compensation statutory problems that we have.
Back in 1979 when I had the privilege of being sworn in as Governor the first time, we had a horrendous problem in unemployment insurance to the point where it was stifling our economic development, and our Workman's Comp rates were the first or second lowest in the nation with adequate coverages in an appropriately delivered program.
We fixed, Republicans and Democrats together, fixed the unemployment insurance statutes, and 16 years later, those fixes are still in place.
Now what we have to do is address, once and for all, this continuing controversy of straightening out the Workman's Compensation problem.
We are going to ask the Legislature to pass a statute that says that if a person has an injury or claims an injury, it must be supported by objective medical evidence.
We're also going to ask the Legislature to pass legislation that if a person claims an injury, it has to be determined that it was a major, contributing cause to the condition of the person claiming the injury.
We are going to ask the Legislature to do something that no other state in the history of this nation has ever done.
We are going to ask you to pass legislation that says, in the courts of South Dakota, that any party--a party, not a witness--any party who knowingly--and that's the key--who knowingly testifies falsely, all their testimony shall be disregarded by the finder of fact.
It makes no sense ever to ask a jury or a judge to have to try and sort out a series of truths and a series of lies within someone's testimony.
People should know, as a party, that if they knowingly testify falsely, they will run the risk of having all of their testimony disregarded by the trier of fact.
The video lottery issue is something that ever since it came into play--we're all familiar with how that has been dealt with in the political arena.
But our voters in this state have once again spoken, and at some point in time--whether it is a large margin or a small margin--we've all got a responsibility to accept the will of the voters.
The essence of democracy--one of them is, you respect, you defend, you protect and you recognize the rights of the minority; but at some point, you have a vote and then the majority rules.
We are going to ask that the Legislature pass legislation that raises the state's share to 50 percent in the video lottery field.
And we're going to ask that all that increase, over and above what Governor Miller has put into his budget already for what I will call his projected increase--all of it be devoted to property tax relief.
I can tell you that during the course of the campaign trail, every place that my primary opponent and my general election opponents and I traveled, the people made it very clear that they did not want state government to continue to grow by those types of revenues.
All of us, basically, made a commitment, all of us did, that we would see to it that state government would not grow by any of those increased revenues from increased, basically, what we call the state's share.
So, we are going to ask that that be returned in the package on property tax relief.
In the area of corrections, it has been studied long enough, and studied, and studied, and studied, and studied.
For some reason, we in South Dakota, when we lack the political courage to make a decision, we study it; and we always hire somebody from out of town because we can blame them once they are gone.
Issues in America have become the most studied things for hire on the planet Earth.
We've studied corrections long enough.
There are a few basic things that we have to do.
One of them is, we must have a separate women's prison.
It is entirely inappropriate that we have men and women prisoners housed and forced together in a confined atmosphere, notwithstanding the rule of the one-foot rule that they have between the inmates.
It's entirely inappropriate to have men and women prisoners housed together.
In addition to that, we honestly do need what some of us refer to as a boot camp in South Dakota.
This does not have to be an expensive thing.
It doesn't have to be a monument to stupidity in terms of its infrastructure.
It can be relatively simple, because I dare to say any of you that have ever been through a boot camp didn't go through something that was sophisticated in its infrastructure.
It was sophisticated in its human resources.
We have young people today, unfortunately in greater numbers, because we've always had them.
There was a day when you could go to a real boot camp, but America has foreclosed that option in the armed forces.
So, where you have a child who's troubled, and a child that does not respect himself, and does not respect other people or does not respect other people's property, we no longer have the armed forces option that so many, many people used to be able to take advantage of.
Everybody in America debates whether or not it works or doesn't work.
The fact of the matter is, we in South Dakota have always been able to make things work that others, elsewhere in America, haven't been able to make work.
We can make a boot camp work.
In addition to that, we have to set aside a particular structure and setting for a juvenile prison.
Unfortunately, we've got a small group--and it isn't very large, and having talked with members of the judiciary and individuals in corrections, it is not a very large group, but we've got a group that numbers less than 30 at any given point in time--that every single resource program and assistance that can be provided them through the resources of South Dakota have been given, and they absolutely refuse to change.
And these young people cannot go to an adult prison for obvious reasons, so we have to have a facility where we can take what are at least known now as incorrigible young people--Lord forbid we ever have to classify anybody that way--but where we can take incorrigible young people and put them into a very restrictive environment where the community and other people are safe.
I ask you to join with the Attorney General and ourselves to pass a truth-in-sentencing law.
It should not be controversial.
"It shouldn't be confusing, but if a court were to sentence somebody, let's say, to five years in the prison, there is nothing wrong or inappropriate with saying, at the same time, ""and having sentenced you to five years means that if you behave yourself, if you are paroled at your first eligible date, you will be out it in""--I'll just make it up--""11 months"" or ""18 months."
That way, the public will know what sentences really mean.
It reached the point at one point in time where they needed a computer to try and figure out individuals' release dates.
But a simple truth-in-sentencing law that the Attorney General has called for makes a lot of sense in terms of the public's right to know.
We're also going to ask the Legislature to pass something that to my knowledge nobody else has done.
It does not have to provide for severe penalties, but for more than two decades, we've been talking about going after the pushers in drugs.
We spend untold millions of dollars going after what we call the pushers in drugs.
It's time now to start locking up, even if it is for a short period of time, the users of drugs.
And if somebody in South Dakota has a drug addiction problem, we ask that any legislation you pass has a delayed implementation date until January 1 of next year, so that anybody who claims to have an illicit drug addiction problem can come forward with total freedom and immunity from any prosecution, or any threat of confinement, or criminal record and receive treatment; because, if they don't, then the law will provide that if they are a user, they will have to do some confinement time.
We're going to ask that the Legislature pass the necessary authority to let us truly get beyond political rhetoric and try and do something about welfare.
When I say welfare, I recognize as much as every single one of you that all of us, all of us in society have a collective responsibility to those children and those people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in an unfortunate happenstance.
But we have third generation welfare families in South Dakota, and given the opportunities that have been available in this state, given the quality of our education historically over the last several decades, given the communal and the religious and the societal aspect of South Dakota, no one, no family should be in their third generation of welfare.
So, what we have to do is stand back and take a look at it.
The federal government has said they are going to do things about mandates.
The reality is, when the dust all settles, there probably won't be a great deal done except some of the rules will come off and the amount of money that comes out of Washington will be less than before.
And if that is the national consensus, so be it; but I don't think we in South Dakota can afford to wait any longer for them to fulfill their political promises in Washington.
We've got the responsibility to move forward on what we think is appropriate and what we think is right for the people of South Dakota.
In the area of housing--I can remember years ago when we had to fight in the legislative body to get the authority for the South Dakota Housing Authority to issue its bonds to attempt to provide affordable housing for our citizens.
Not today.
Although the federal government has greatly restricted what can be done in that area with tax-free bonding, the reality is, we have a housing problem in South Dakota.
We have an affordable housing problem in virtually every single community in this state.
I've met people in economic development who have talked about bringing prospective businesses that have said they are concerned about the ability to attract workers because of housing in some of our communities.
I think this is the type of thing that we all have to address with respect to the elderly, the people that are handicapped, and working men and women.
We're also going to ask that the Legislature finally do something about state mandates on local government.
If the unique framework that we had between the federal government, the partnership in the states, is federalism; we can call this stateism.
But the reality of the situation is as we complain about all these mandates from Washington, and, as you Ladies and Gentlemen that've been in the legislative body before know, you sit and you complain and you're frustrated time after time when someone says, We're doing this because the feds say we have to do it.
The local government has been saying that at an increasing crescendo in South Dakota and we're going to propose that, with very few exceptions, virtually every single state mandate in the K-12 education area be removed from local government.
What the educational or experience qualifications of a school superintendent or principal are should be a serious concern to local taxpayers and local parents and local school boards, but the state really has no role in dictating what type of educational certificates you have to have to hold a job.
We all know that just because someone has a diploma doesn't mean they can do anything.
Most people can with diplomas, but all can't; and so we're going to ask, basically, that we repeal virtually every mandate--not all of them, but almost every mandate--in the K-12 area.
We're also going to do that with respect to local government.
For too long as I traveled around the state on the campaign trail I listened to mayors and city council people and city planners and finance officers say, The state's making us do it, the state's making us do it.
Sometimes, very honestly, the state isn't making them do it.
Its a cop out and an easy way to blame somebody else for wanting to increase funding.
So, I think that we really have to sit back as we look at what we can afford to do and how we're going to do it.
We have to remove a tremendous number of these mandates.
You know, we all talk about cooperating in government.
It's a speech that all of us give, but the reality is, there's truly very little of it going on in South Dakota.
We've got over 300 cities and towns, we've got 200 school districts, we've got 66 counties, we've got nine Indian tribes and we've got the state government of South Dakota with all of its departments and agencies.
Everybody talks about how they want to cooperate; and usually that means I will swallow you, you shouldn't be allowed to swallow me.
I'm not talking about eliminating anything but the reality is our citizens in this state are frankly fed up with all of us if we do politics as usual.
I've been to the organizations and I've been to the rallies where all of you in both political parties go.
You know that what I'm saying you've listened to also.
The people don't care most the time who delivers the service, they just want those snow plows plowing the snow.
When they dial 911, they want someone to show up for the emergency.
When they smell smoke and they call for help, they want someone to come in a red or a yellow truck.
And while we, who are in government, can always think of a thousand reasons why it won't work, the time has come for state government, county government, city government and township government, where necessary, to figure out how to do things together; because, I can assure you, there's not enough wealth in South Dakota, no matter what taxing scheme you want to pass, to take care of all the needs that all the things our people think they want done and that they want funded.
So we have a golden opportunity this year and it's not going to come again for a long time, because with this property tax measure--I shouldn't even say this in a speech--but we can have the courage to do things that some people might not have, normally, in the name of property tax reform and finding the money that's necessary to lower people's property taxes.
I told the cabinet when I met with them yesterday--we had a cabinet meeting--and as we visited, I asked them to seriously step back and take a look at what functions are we doing that we can honestly do with others.
It just doesn't mean the State of South Dakota and its political subdivisions, it may mean some of our neighboring states, because virtually every program and function that we do, they do.
When you get some of the states, they do a lot more, but they all do the things that we do.
So there's nothing that's sacrosanct and nothing that's off limits as we endeavor over the course of the next year to really identify those areas where we can really sit down together and get something done.
Matter of fact, last week I met with several of the mayors representing the Municipal League, and I had a meeting before that with the Mayor of Sioux Falls.
I can tell you that the mayor in Sioux Falls and I have already decided that next week we're going to call each other.
We're going to designate a couple of individuals.
We're going to sit down and actually start working on an agenda where it may be possible for state government and municipal government in Minnehaha County--hopefully, maybe even county government--can set examples on how we can do things more productive or more effective together, and more cost effective together, than we're doing separately.
The same's true in the area of privatisation.
We always say we have to run government like a business.
There are some businesses you'd never want to run government like.
It cuts both ways, but the fact of the matter is we all have a responsibility to bring the most productive, most cost-effective government that we possibly can because there are no volunteers for extra taxes for inefficiency or lack of productivity.
This phrase that everybody uses nowadays, as I've said before, of reinventing government is nonsense.
The original invention had nothing wrong with it.
We don't need to go out and reinvent government.
What we need to do is step back and look at what is it that we honestly, politically want our government to do--How much do we want to spend and who are we going to stick with the bill--because that's basically what government does.
We're going to ask the Legislature to pass legislation abolishing the Indian Affairs Commission and creating an Office of Tribal Affairs.
The reality of the situation is the vast majority of things that we deal with are really on a government-to-government basis.
What the state government needs is an individual who's a liaison point in cooperating and working with the nine Indian tribes in the state.
"You know, years ago when I was Attorney General, late one evening I was up working, and Governor Kneip came up to my office, and he sat down and kind of exhaled a lot a air, and he said, ""Bill, I've figured out what our problem is in South Dakota."
We have nine foreign nations inside our border and no foreign policy.
That was an awful insightful comment that he made, because we hear talk all the time, too much frankly, about all the problems between the races, and talking about it is never going to solve it, ever.
It'll get you on television, it'll get you quoted in the newspaper, and it can even make you controversial, but it's not going to solve any problem.
If you step back and honestly look at where the state and tribal governments have problems, it's generally three areas: one, the criminal law, debating or arguing who has the right or the primary right in a particular location, to protect people and property.
If you think about it that shouldn't be something that you fight very much about.
The second thing is taxation.
State and tribal governments fight about taxation, and if you think about it, What is the function of governmental taxation?
It's to raise the money to provide the goods and services the government provides to people.
And the third area where there's controversy is what I call the natural resource area--water, game, fish, things of that nature.
Other than those three areas, it's difficult most the time to find an area where there's controversy.
For too long, honestly, we've all talked about methods by which we ought to be approaching each other, and I honestly believe the time has come for all of us to just step back and analyze and be willing to discuss what are the areas where we can cooperate with each other.
Recognizing there are some areas where we never will; but I submit that if the United States and Britton and France and Egypt and Syria can figure out how to get together to fight Saddam Hussein, we can figure out how to sit down between the tribes and the government of South Dakota to accomplish our common goals and a lot of our common objectives.
We've got the question of property taxes, and I can tell you that I've heard the same message that all of you did.
Our people are fed up with government growth, and it isn't just the price of their taxes, it's the growth of government.
There's absolutely no reason in the world why over the last seven years, even including the two years where there was a property tax freeze, taxes at the local level have grown at 20 percent greater than the rate of inflation.
Now if it's mandates forcing that, we're going to remove them.
We're going to remove every obstacle and obligation from their way that state government can remove, so that nobody can blame the state government for this.
But I can honestly also say our people find it absolutely, totally, unequivocally unacceptable to continue to have governments, revenues, and spending increase at a rate that's greater than the rate of inflation year-in and year-out.
No matter what kind of taxing scheme you're for and what your public or your hidden agenda is, we will never be able to have enough money to fund all the things that everybody says we want to do.
"If we found another $150 to $300 million this year and put it in state and local government, I can assure you that in a year and a half they would all be back saying, ""We're out of money."
We need more.
It's an addiction, it's an addiction of democracy.
The people think the best way to get votes is to deliver the most pork or beans or whatever it is.
In different instances we all suffer from that sickness, but I can tell you--as you know I'm not telling any of you legislators anything you don't know, because you've been on that campaign trail--the public's just plain fed up.
And woe be to anybody in the Republican or the Democratic party in any elected position that doesn't pay heed to the voters when they say enough is enough.
We're tired of these governments growing at an excessive rate.
I'm going to ask that the Leadership of the House and the Senate give me the opportunity to come before the Legislature a week from today to give you a special address and message on a plan that we believe will solve and meet the demands of our citizens in the property tax area.
We all to varying degrees have campaign promises out there, and we plan on coming before you--if you'll give us permission--a week from today and presenting to you a plan that we honestly believe, one, should be passed and, two, if it is will address the serious issues that we have with respect to property taxes in the state.
We can do it without a sales tax increase, and we can do it without an income tax, but we can't do it if we're going to have government at all levels in South Dakota, state and local, doing business as usual.
It's going to take changes in the way we do business.
You know, as we talk about the state of the state, South Dakota's basically in pretty good shape.
When I talk outside of the state, I always talk about the South Dakota advantage--and it clearly is for all the criticism and the complainings that all of us go through at times--the reality is, we live basically in a pretty safe state.
We live in a state where by-and-large our people get along pretty well with each other.
We live in a state where, yes, we have different political parties, but on 95 percent of the issues, we're looking for the best solution.
There's games played the other 5 percent of the times, but the vast majority of the time is looking for constructive solutions and the competition is who has the better idea.
It should never be who gets the most credit.
There will be enough laws introduced and passed this year for everybody to get a lot of credit--and don't forget the second floor--but there really will be.
When we talk about jobs, we've had an incredible phenomenon.
Does everybody in South Dakota make as much as they'd like to?
No, they don't, but our unemployment being where it is tells us that we've been very successful in our endeavors, and if we take an honest look elsewhere in America we, unfortunately, can see in the technology age a tremendous number of the new jobs everywhere are not high-paying jobs unless the people have the skills and that knows no political boundaries.
A good job for somebody in Lemmon is just as important as it is in this city and all the rest of them.
We've got basically a pretty good infrastructure in South Dakota.
We've made phenomenal accomplishments in our highways, in our basic transportation.
You know Badger Clark said something that I brought with me today.
"He was our long-time poet laureate, and he wrote ""Mountain, plain, or prairie field, Summer heat or snow; South Dakota's people are the grandest crop that grows!"""
You and I believe that, you and I understand that, and you and I have the responsibility to do the business for that crop.
If you count Bill Janklow, the other Constitutional Officers, the Lieutenant Governor, and all of you Ladies and Gentlemen, we actually represent, in terms of numbers, .0001 of the people of South Dakota.
But this little group of .0001 of the people of South Dakota has been clothed with the responsibility to do the peoples' work.
Ninety percent of us or more did not disagree on the campaign trail what the problems were.
In most instances, we didn't even disagree on what the solutions were.
I can tell you Ladies and Gentlemen in the Democratic party as strongly as I can say then to you in the Republican party, we want to work with all of you.
There is no Republican answer to all these problems.
There's no Democrat answer to all these problems.
The answer lies in each and every one of us using the God-given talents that we have to come together to try and find the consensus around which we can work to do the people's business.
I look forward to that opportunity.
I am truly excited about the challenge--I have shaken the hands of an awful lot of you since the election--and so are you.
So now let's roll up our sleeves, and let's go to work, and let's study as hard as we can as we work, so when the report card comes out to the voters two years from now, it'll be a report card that shows that we've improved in all categories by which we're measured.
Thank you very much.
