SENTENCES
"Senate President Mizuguchi, Speaker of the House Souki, members of the 18th Hawai'i State Legislature, Honored Guests, my Fellow Citizens: I am truly honored that the high honor and great privilege of presenting our State Administration's appraisal of the state of our State has been given to me."
"As a former legislator, I am not a stranger to this process."
And I want you to know I am proud to have once served amongst you and I am most appreciative for your invitation to present the goals my cabinet and I intend to pursue.
"At the outset, there are two things I want to bring to your attention."
"The first, is that whatever I say here this morning is said with hope and confidence."
I believe our ability to solve our state's problems is limited only by our imagination and resolve.
"Second, I will not cover all of the issues which face our state."
"Instead, I will focus on those issues which are of the highest priority."
"Jefferson said that ""democracy begins in conversation."
Let our conversation begin in earnest here.Ethics in Government.
No government can sustain itself if the people do not believe in it.
"In the 20 years I have served the public, I have never seen public confidence in government as low as it is today."
Too many people find their government irrelevant to their lives.
"Too many people have lost faith in their government's ability to solve their problems, meet their needs and make life better."
"And there are far too many people, who believe that public officials are self-serving, arrogant and corrupt."
We must restore faith in state government.
And we will begin by reaffirming our belief that government must serve and not be served.
"As your Governor, I will lead by example, as I have over my 20 years in public service."
"And my cabinet will follow my lead, making it clear to all who serve in my administration that cronyism and corruption will not be tolerated."
There is no room in my administration for those who violate this standard.
"To this end, I have appointed an Attorney General who understands fully that the Attorney General is the People's lawyer-and that her supreme loyalty in enforcing the law is not to me as Governor nor to you as legislators-but to the public, to the People."
This fundamental principle is the cornerstone of public service.
"Like the Attorney General, our loyalty to the public supersedes our loyalty to each other."
It will be the creed of my administration.
"To allay the public's concern about cronyism and corruption in government, we will establish a Public Integrity/White Collar Crime Unit in the Attorney General's Office to fairly and vigorously enforce the law."
Openness will be the hallmark of my administration.
I have instructed my cabinet to be liberal in providing you with information.
"In time of trouble, you will never find me or my cabinet hunkering down defensively.That has never been my style."
"As Governor, my cards will be face up on the table, as they have always been."
"If you want information, ask for it."
"If we have it, we will provide it.Economic Development."
The past few difficult years have taught us something we should never forget.
It is the economy which allows us our lifestyle.
"Without a strong economy, we all suffer."
Hawaii's economy is at a crossroads.
"Tourism will bounce back, but large corporate agri-business such as sugar, and defense spending are in a decline."
"We must diversify our economy, strike a better balance among economic, environmental and social objectives, and lay the foundation for a better educated and higher skilled work force and population."
Economic opportunities literally surround us.
Hawaii is at the center of the world's most vibrant and dynamic economic region.
"My director of DBEDT, Dr. Seiji Naya, estimates there are $600 billion in trade flying over or bypassing us every year."
"If we could only capture one-tenth of one percent of that amount, it would be $600 million in additional revenues which can create new jobs in Hawaii."
"Opportunities in education, healthcare and the knowledge industry hold potential for Hawaii."
"A few years ago, for example, Boston University was interested in buying Hawaii Loa College to service the demand for American higher education among Pacific Rim nations."
"Hawaii Pacific University, with a 56% out of state enrollment, has successfully found its niche in this market."
American healthcare is also in high demand in the Pacific Rim.
"A few weeks ago, I hosted the King of Malaysia who had just returned from Stanford Medical Center where he received medical treatment and decided to stop in Hawaii to rest and play golf before returning to Malaysia."
The appeal of American healthcare is not limited to kings.
"Every year, thousands of foreigners flock to the United States to patronize American hospitals, doctors, medical schools and businesses."
We will not be able to take advantage of these opportunities unless we take some basic steps.
"First, we must build a quality public school system which will produce a high quality workforce."
"Creating economic opportunities means little, if our children are not prepared to seize them."
This is why improving the public schools continues to be my highest priority.
"Second, meaningful economic diversification and growth will not occur unless we nurture a favorable business climate."
This means accelerating our efforts to cut red tape and bring down workers compensation costs by reforming the system.
"Effective workers compensation reform will not be achieved unless all of the affected parties: business, labor, medical providers and government work together toward a common solution."
I believe worker's compensation reform is so important that I have asked Lt. Governor Hirono to lead the administration's team.
She has already developed a plan which will soon be presented to you.
"Third, Hawaii needs a first rate, state of the art telecommunications system."
We have made great strides in building a good telecommunications network.
"However, it is not a question of our telecommunication capacity, rather it is a question of ""access""."
"In other words, Hawaii's telecommunications system is like a super freeway with few on-ramps."
"We need to build more on-ramps, to provide greater accessibility to our telecommunications system.This will help business."
"To encourage greater accessibility, I will propose that the PUC deregulate telecommunications, to create a climate of free and open competition to allow all telecommunications companies--telephone, cable, microwave, cellular and satellite--to operate here."
Tourism will continue to be Hawaii's largest industry.
And we will continue to strongly support tourism without micromanaging it.
"In this connection, we will continue our strong support of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau but require that the private sector begin to assume a greater share of HVB's funding.Education."
Nothing we do will be more important than improving the education of Hawaii's children.
A quality education goes far beyond preparing our children to earn a living.
It is essential to improving our quality of life.
The passage of the Omnibus Education Bill last year was a major step toward education reform.
We will support implementation of the various reforms of the Act.
"Given the fiscal crisis we find ourselves in, it is inappropriate for me to propose new education initiatives such as early childhood education which require new revenue."
"Instead, let me discuss some reforms which will help improve our schools and can be made even in this time of fiscal crisis."
It takes approximately five years to build a school.
It will take First Hawaiian Bank approximately 2 years to build its 30 story skyscraper on King and Bishop Streets.
"First Hawaiian Bank has an advantage, however."
Walter Dods did not have to go through 41 steps to have FHB's construction approved before they could begin construction.
We propose to streamline the process.
"We will establish a ""one-stop"" clearinghouse to facilitate all new school construction."
"This will require an integrated, team approach by all of the appropriate state agencies to plan and implement school construction."
The repair and maintenance of schools has suffered because such work is usually limited to the summer.
This increases the price of school repair and has created a logjam of schools awaiting repair and maintenance work.
"We will consider establishing a ""mobile"" school consisting of airconditioned trailers to move from school to school to permit year round repair and maintenance."
"There are so many important issues I would have liked to discuss with you: long-term care, housing, transportation, etc."
"However, you will be informed about my views on these issues as you go through the budget review process and hear the administration's bills."
I am foregoing talking about these issues because I want to devote the remainder of my time to the state's biggest problem - its fiscal condition.State Fiscal Crisis.
"Of all of the issues, there is nothing more urgent, more demanding of our immediate attention, more central to all of our deliberations than the State's financial crisis."
"Make no mistake about it: no governor, no legislature since statehood has faced a financial crisis of the magnitude and severity that we face today."
"Until Saturday, we believed that the State faced a deficit of $150 million over the next fiscal biennium."
Further analysis of our financial condition during the past weekend led us to the conclusion that the situation is even worse: that we now face a deficit in excess of $250 million.
"Believe me, we are as frustrated as you must be that the deficit is changing for the worse."
Let me decipher for you what seems to have happened.
The executive budget submitted to you by the previous administration indicated that there would be a general fund balance of some $80 million at the end of the 1995-97 fiscal biennium.
The first signal that this projected balance was not likely to hold up occurred when the Council on Revenues submitted its last general fund revenue estimates indicating that the State would be taking in $120 million less than previously projected.
"We then learned that certain programs, largely social services entitlements, required deficiency appropriations of $30.5 million this year."
"This also meant additional expenditures for the next biennium of some $51 million, making for a potential shortfall of some $200 million at the end of the biennium."
Our latest analysis indicates that some of the calculations and assumptions were incorrect.
"For example, the savings from the early retirement program enacted last session were overstated by $33 million because it was mistakenly assumed that all retirees were employees paid by the general fund whereas a significant number were paid by other funds."
"In addition, there was a miscalculation of nontax revenues in the financial plan requiring a downward adjustment of $10.4 million."
"At this point, let me say that I don't expect you to remember all of these adjustments in all of their details."
"But I am obliged to mention them, because we all need to understand that there is a sound basis for concluding that our situation is much worse than we previously thought.Could it get worse?"
"Unfortunately, the answer is yes."
"We do not yet know how changes in federal policies will affect state expenditures, but the outlook is not very bright.Could it get better?"
"We can hope that general fund revenues will pick up soon, but it would not be wise to base our financial policy on wishful thinking.What then can we do?"
What course of action should we follow?
These are the basic alternatives.
"First, we could raise taxes to make up for the shortfalls, but neither I nor the public would accept any new taxes without first exhausting the efforts to control state spending."
"Second, we could impose across the board reductions in state expenditures, but such an arbitrary action would mean the most needed and worthwhile programs would suffer."
"Third, we could restructure government to realize efficiencies and economies and reduce or curtail programs which are less needed or outlived their usefulness."
I propose that the third alternative is the most responsible and the best course of action to follow if we are to resolve the immediate crisis and also provide the basis for a more efficient and economical state government over the longer term.
One of the first steps that we can take in redesigning the structure of government is to review the need for all boards and commissions and those agencies which are attached to the core departments and offices of state government.
We will start with the Office of the Governor.
I have already begun the curtailment of the Governor's Agricultural Coordinating Committee and propose its elimination because its functions should be assumed by the Department of Agriculture.
"Similarly, we do not need a separate Office of International Relations, not because our relationships in a global economy are not important but because its mission can be pursued by the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism."
"I also propose that we review the Office of Children and Youth, the Executive Office on Aging, and Office of Youth Services to determine whether their functions can be absorbed by existing departments."
A thorough review should also be conducted of the many agencies assigned to the principal departments with a view towards elimination or consolidation.
"As an example, the State Health Planning and Development Agency has not shown over the years that it has been accomplishing its principal objective of controlling the costs of health facilities."
"Therefore, it should be terminated."
"Likewise, the program of the Office of Space Industries is no longer viable, and it too should be shut down."
"With respect to housing, there are now four agencies involved: the Hawai'i Housing Authority, Housing Finance and Development Corporation, Hawaii Community Development Authority, and Department of Hawaiian Home Lands."
I propose that the first three agencies be consolidated into a Department of Housing.
"As to the housing development function of the new department and that of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, better results could be achieved by contracting all of housing development and construction with the private sector."
We will examine all boards and commissions and recommend the termination of those which are no longer needed.
"This review should especially apply to professional and occupational licensing boards, some of which should probably be sunsetted to remove the onerous burden of unnecessary regulation."
We should extend our review even to advisory boards.
"With all of the emphasis on public education now centered on the individual school, it does not appear that district school advisory councils perform a needed function."
"The agenda for restructuring government is a long one, and our approach should be systematic."
I am establishing a task force on government restructuring to review the roles and responsibilities of the principal departments and to determine the appropriate placement and reassignment of functions.
"The task force, which I will personally chair, will be comprised of the directors of several key departments and will also involve the participation of leaders of the public employee unions and leaders from the business community."
"Just as organizations need to be restructured for economy and efficiency, so should programs be redesigned if better results and savings can be achieved."
"For example, we have recognized that our health care programs have been extremely and increasingly costly, and QUEST was developed to address that problem."
The underlying principle of QUEST is managed care.
We estimate that QUEST will save $60 million over five years.
"We can realize savings faster if we broaden QUEST now to cover the aged, blind, and disabled."
Further savings can be obtained by extending QUEST to public employees and to retirees.
And we can also enlarge the scope of QUEST to enable the private sector to participate.
The major concern of enlarging QUEST is whether members will be able to choose their doctors and get the quality of care they are accustomed to.They will.
Five managed care plans are now available.
"With a huge infusion of new participants--about 140,000 in addition to the 120,000 now enrolled--experience shows that most doctors will join one of the managed care programs."
"With nearly a quarter of the people in the state in a single, massive purchasing pool for health care, QUEST will have enormous bargaining power with providers to purchase quality care at affordable prices."
"Even as the major thrust in the restructuring of government and the redesign of programs is to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings, there will be instances where a higher level of expenditures will be required."
We must continue to fund increased staffing at the State Hospital not just because the courts require it but because it is the right thing to do.
And there will be instances where we must provide funding where none was previously appropriated.
"In this regard, we must honor our commitment to the settlement of $600 million over 20 years to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands simply because justice for native Hawaiians requires it."
"We will have to make do with less funds elsewhere, and in this case, we intend to earmark $30 million annually from general obligation bond funds normally used for the state's capital improvements program."
We should consider this matter not merely as a settlement to benefit native Hawaiians but as a matter which will help the housing needs of our communities generally.
Let's remember that every family moving into a home on Hawaiian home lands frees a home in the community to help with our affordable housing problem.
"All of our citizens, not just native Hawaiians, stand to gain."
"There are some immediate, though limited, measures that we can take to improve general fund revenues."
We should review the many special and revolving funds.
"Where the need for the funds is questionable or where the balances are excessive, we should consider transferring the funds to the general fund."
There is the potential of gaining $31 million for the general fund through such transfers.
I also propose that we look to eliminating or reducing certain tax credits and exemptions.
Keep in mind that we currently give away $140 million in tax credits annually.
"Under current financial conditions, some of these exemptions may no longer be justifiable."
"If the current exemption for cruise ships from the general excise tax were to be eliminated and if the tax credits for food purchases, medical services, and care of dependent children were to be limited to those with adjusted gross incomes of less than $100,000, an additional $11.6 million would accrue to the general fund."
The fiscal crisis which I have described represents a formidable challenge to you and to my administration.
"There is no single solution, no magic bullet, which will solve the crisis."
I have suggested to you some of the actions that can and should be taken.
"But even if we do all of the things that I have proposed, the bottom line is this: we will still have to make budget cuts of $40 million in the current fiscal year, $80 million in each of the next two years of the fiscal biennium, for a total of $200 million in cuts between now and June 30, 1997."
"In the days ahead, we will identify to the extent possible, the specific cuts that we are proposing."
"If these cuts are still insufficient, I will hold the line during the budget execution process by applying spending restrictions."
"In all of these difficult tasks, I ask for your support, your ideas, and your full participation."
The immediate crisis must be resolved before we can move forward to do the things that we really want to do to improve the quality of life for Hawaii's people.
"Like many of you, I support early childhood education and affordable long-term care as programs which are sorely needed by our people."
"I am determined that these needs will be met, and they will be when we put our financial house in order."
"Recently, a friend told me that this is a terrible time to be governor , that there was no money to do anything and that he felt sorry for me.I disagree with him."
"Rather, I am honored to have been chosen governor by the people to lead in this time of crisis."
And you should feel honored too.
"During the election, the people of Hawaii knew our state was headed for hard times."
"And yet, they chose you and me to lead, to give them hope, to make things better by doing the right thing.Think about it."
"There are only 78 of us-51 representatives, 25 senators, a lieutenant governor and governor--chosen out of a population of nearly 1.2 million people."
We have been given an awesome responsibility and a great privilege by the people of this great state.
"A wise person once said, ""A pessimist sees calamity in every opportunity; an optimist sees opportunity in every calamity."
Let us be optimists and seize the opportunity to make things right.
We will then earn the right to serve the people of Hawaii with pride and honor.
