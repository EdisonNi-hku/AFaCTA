The order makes the Ethics Act supreme over all other laws and agreements in the state, even those in collective bargaining agreements.
The order creates a chief compliance office in the executive branch; stipulates reviews of allegations in 10 days or less; and requires training on best investigation practices by the end of this year, and every two years thereafter.
These are powerful protections that the legislature should emulate.

Two and a half years ago, our Departments of Public Health and Veterans Affairs responded to a tragic outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at our Quincy Veterans Home that claimed the lives of 13 veterans.
Our leadership team and our medical and caregiver staffs took all the right steps to deal with the crisis.
We discovered the true cause of the outbreak through pro-actives tests.
We partnered with the CDC, took each of their recommendations, installed a new $6 million water treatment system, and instituted best practices for water flushing and purification.
According to CDC, the effort has resulted in a substantial reduction in cases of Legionnaires’ disease and detectable Legionella in the water systems.
Even though research shows that Legionella is everywhere, including this very Capitol, our goal is to prevent Legionella infections at the Quincy Home.
The CDC says it is impossible to eliminate the bacteria.
But we will fight against it as hard as our veterans fought for us.
The latest CDC recommendations are being implemented.
We are going beyond the recommendations of experts, and we are investigating the possibility of entire system replacements, and perhaps even a new facility.

Christine Wilson, here today, is one of thousands of homeowners in Illinois who have property taxes that are unfair, unaffordable and crushing their quality of life.
It is a vicious form of oppression.
The system traps people in their homes, vaporizes their equity, drives mortgages under water, and in some cases, pushes people out of our state.
It is time to put a stop to the corruption.
Two weeks ago, we issued an executive order that prevents legislators from practicing before the state property tax appeal board.
And today Sen. Oberweis and Rep. Wehrli will introduce legislation that asks you to apply this same reform to every legislator who might practice before an assessment appeal board anywhere in the state.
And once again, we will ask you to pass legislation that brings true property tax relief, giving people the ability to lower their property taxes through a simple voter referendum.
These are reforms we must enact if we want common sense to win out over corruption.
There is one more step we need to take to regain public confidence.

So, on this point I think we can also agree: It is time we do what the people of Illinois want.
Halt the advance of taxes.
Stop spending money we don’t have.
Get our pensions under control.
And give power back to the people.
The surest road to economic vitality and job growth is a collaborative effort to regain our financial integrity.

We have significant challenges ahead.

God bless the people of Illinois.
And God bless the United States of America.
