SENTENCES
"Sit, sit, listen.Let's get at this.Thank you, sir."
"Well, when I was getting wired up out there just a second ago, there was a scene on the practical jokers where we have a ball of wires and they're in a ball and they're trying to get somebody to untangle it, and Marshal and I were fighting with that just a few minutes ago, boy."
"But nevertheless, it's great to be here, it's holy ground, sacred ground, and I know just how serious and how big of an impact we have on so, so many."
"So let me tell you this: I'm fortunate to report that since the first time I was here, I weigh about the same amount.Now, that's not good news."
But I hope tonight I'll have a lot of good news for you.
"You know, I know how hard you work."
I know how hard it is to serve.
I know how much you have to sacrifice from your families and your businesses.And mine the same.
"And so I've got Cathy, our First Lady, over here, Jill, my daughter, that has a beautiful, beautifulest grand -- son, and our only grandson, J. C. And her husband Adam's not with us right now, because he's looking after J. C. as he's bouncing off the wall everywhere.And my son Jay."
And it -- And his wife Catherine's not able to be with us tonight.
And right beside Jay is my older son Bray.
"So -- and believe you me, he's a whole lot more to handle than all the rest of them."
"But tonight, they've made a little more room for me, and they've given me the opportunity to sit on my stool."
"Now, I do that lots of places, and I do that because my knees are in really bad shape.Of course, you know that."
"And I've had 10,000 surgeries -- and I'm exaggerating to make my point, but -- and I've still got to have some more."
"I was just too slow in sports to get out of the way, and so I got hit a lot."
"And -- But tonight, I'm proud to be sitting and talking to you and not at a podium maybe lecturing to you."
And the same is true for all those that are out there watching us on TV right now.
"To me, I need to be talking to them as if I were in their living room, or if I were sitting on a log with them in the middle of the woods grouse hunting."
"You know, that's what I think the people really, really connect with and really get."
"Now, I know that it would be impossible for any of us to disagree that the first time you ever saw me, the first time I walked in the door, things were pretty doggone tough."
"The first set of books they handed me -- you know this, and you know I'm not exaggerating in any shape, form or fashion.But our state was bankrupt.There's no way around it."
"I mean, when you look at the current year you're in with the $217,000,000 deficit that you're going to have that year, six months have already elapsed before I walked in the door, and we're saying, we're going to be $217,000,000 short that year."
"And the next year, it's gonna be $497,000,000, and the next year, 600 and some."
"And in the last year, $772,000,000."
"Now, that's not how bad it's going to be; that's cumulative how bad it's going to be.So yeah, add them all up."
"And before you know it, you get to a number that is so astronomical, it's not even comprehendible."
"Now, anybody would say -- anybody would say, ""Well, what are we going to do?What are we going to do?"
"How much money do we got in the bank?"""
And immediately turn to the Rainy Day.
"And we say, ""Well, we can't take any more money out of Rainy Day, because if we take more money out of Rainy Day, the bonds are already going to be de-rated, and they were.So what are you going to do?What are you going to do?And I prayed a lot.A lot."
"And I truly give the good Lord the credit for all the good ideas, and I'll take the credit for the bad ones."
And I've had plenty of credit for the bad ones.
"And I said, somehow, some way overcome them and work."
"But at the end of the day, after we went through everything there was to go through, 23 months later, we're here today, 23 months."
"Seems like an eternity, but it just seems like it just happened yesterday."
There's been lots and lots and lots of hard work.
"You've done a lot of great work, you really have."
And I could never thank you enough for it.
"I could never thank you enough for the State, for the people of West Virginia."
"I do feel like I came up with a dadgum good bunch of ideas, but at the same time, I thank you for your work."
This is not a king or a dictatorship.This is not one.
"This is a body of people that are all in this together, working for one cause, in my book, and that is for the people of this state."
"Now, I'm very proud tonight to say just -- when I got here, we had multiple, multiple years - four or five years - of cut budgets.Didn't have anywhere to go.Had to cut."
Had to cut to balance the budget.
"Well, we haven't had any cut budgets recently, and we're not going to have one today either."
"Today, we have things that are so good, so pluses.No new taxes.Did you hear that?No new taxes."
"In fact, we're going to embark on significant tax cuts."
"Now, I know there is those out in the never-never land that are wondering, well, how?How can it be?"
"How can you possibly, possibly embark on all of these things that have been introduced or that are floating around out there?I'm going to tell you tonight."
"And I'm going to tell you, at the end of the day, you're going to see a budget that is increased less than the rate of inflation, a budget that is increasing significantly less than the -- than the economic growth of our state, and it's going to be able to do all the things that I've told you that we could do."
I challenge you over and over to watch the numbers.
"We all know on day one that -- red, red, red, red."
"Today, we have an all-time record."
"Now, I'm telling you, this bothers me."
"But when you're able to announce to the world - whether it be in the media or social media or all of our friends or whomever it may be, but you're able to announce - that the biggest in the State's history -- now, that's pretty damn big to me."
"I mean, that's all there is to it."
The biggest in the State's history.
The biggest in the State's history.
"For six months, a surplus bigger than we've ever had before."
And the largest revenue that we've ever had before in the first six months of collection.
And I tease about Bray all the time.
"But I'd say if you go back to whenever in West Virginia, even Bray wasn't here then."
"Now, it's possible, but I'm not sure -- we probably should get a birth certificate."
"But nevertheless, it is really an accomplishment.No one guy can do this.There's no way."
"Tonight, I would -- I would have said before, make education our centerpiece."
"You see, I've really been a believer that education is the hot spot that really can change our image."
"You know, so many on the outside -- you and I know how good it is here in West Virginia, and we know how great our people are here."
"We know how good our schools are, and we know how low crime we have and all the goodness that we have and the beauty beyond belief."
But the outside world doesn't know it.
"The outside world, in all honesty, thinks that we're -- or maybe thought is the right word, that we're backward, or that we're absolutely naive."
"I've said it over and over, we had to kill a deer every day in school to feed the kids.But that's not the way it is.That's not West Virginia."
"So I said, let's make education our centerpiece."
"It in itself, that stake we put in the sand right there, that very stake, has changed a lot of our image."
"Now, we decided to make education our centerpiece."
"I am telling you, in my world, at least, we have made education our centerpiece."
"Now, we have decided to invest."
"We got rid of A through F. We absolutely got rid of so much of the ridiculous testing, and we put control back in the local hands as much as we can."
"We absolutely gave a 5 percent teacher's pay raise, and we ended up giving a 5 percent across-the-board pay raise to all State employees.We did change our image."
"We've still got a long ways to go, but we did change it."
"Very proudly tonight, very proudly tonight, I am saying that within my budget, I have included a 5 percent pay raise for all State employees."
"In regard to PEIA, PEIA, I promised that we would put $50,000,000 in PEIA one year, $50,000,000 the next year, $100,000,000 total."
That was the beginning of the talks.
"Then we decided, well, we've got enough surplus dollars, we could put $100,000,000 into PEIA right now."
"Now, it's not a -- I'm -- I'm really only getting started.And that's the good part."
"The other thing is just this: Through -- $100,000,000 in PEIA is not going to solve PEIA forevermore."
"But today, PEIA does not need any true-up moneys."
"Putting $100,000,000 into PEIA is a giant first step."
"And we can do that, and that is exactly what we're going to do."
"But in addition -- in addition, just think about this: Dave Hardy, our Secretary of Revenue and his great disciples, they have found a way that really and truly, we can dedicate not 100 percent of that as required, but only $105,000,000 will earn us $150,000,000 that we can dedicate to PEIA today."
So that's not what we're going to do.
"We're not going to do $100,000,000; we're going to do $150,000,000."
And you know what we're going to do?
"We're not going to take one dime of that from the budgets, the upcoming budgets."
Now -- I'll talk about that again in just a second.
"But -- am I messing up here somewhere?My PBS mic's not on.Well, that's good."
Let's just take time to fix it.
I'm not in charge of the electronics now.
"This isn't a shock collar, is it?"
"While we're doing that, I'm going to untangle wires.No, I'm not either."
"I can't -- I can't pull it off.Okay, are we good?All right, we'll try again."
"I'm going to start from the beginning.No, I better not do that, huh?"
"Of course, you know my commitment to education.I love kids."
I love -- I love what they bring to us every day.
"I have a great fortune to be with kids in the wintertime, a whole lot."
"And I just -- I think you can learn so much, and they're -- it's easy to say that they're a hope, but they are."
"And they're naive, and they learn so much, and we owe them everything."
"You know, tonight, we have with us a teacher, Jada Reeves."
She teaches at Brandley Elementary School.
"Bradley Elementary School -- my son Jay and Jill know Bradley Elementary School really, really well, because Mo Ball who's sitting here in the grandstand with us somewhere, Mo Ball took them -- Mo Ball was a custodian at Bradley Elementary forever, and he was a basketball coach at the school and did great stuff with -- with lots and lots and lots of kids, is my best buddy on the planet."
"Now -- so Jay and Jill went there many, many, many times working and honing their basketball skills with Mo."
"But Jada Reeves, a fifth grade teacher from Bradley Elementary School, would please stand up, and we want -- let's recognize her as our Teacher of the Year."
Everybody started clapping before I could tell them that you were our Teacher of the Year.Congratulations.
"They must love you, and so do I.Thank you."
Another individual I'd like to introduce real quickly is Dan Anderson.
"Dan Anderson leads our charges at Appalachian Bible School, and what he's done at Mount Olive, he needs a great big round of applause."
"So wherever Dan is -- is he here with us tonight?Please stand, Dan."
"Tonight, I'm putting a challenge out to our State Department of Ed."
We have to improve our math scores.
"In 2020 -- right now, we've got to get it done very quickly."
"Right today, we've got to go to work, and we've got to improve our math scores."
"We've got to do something about absenteeism, and we've got to make West Virginia the first state -- You know, I love to say ""first,"" I love to say ""first."
-- the first state to offer computer science class in every high school within our state.
"The other thing is, I want them to always be revisiting our state aid formula just to look -- just to look at ways or possibilities to always make it better."
"I want to urge you to pass into law the ability to raise our math, our science, our foreign language or our special ed teacher salaries in order to be able to be competitive and to attract those people here."
I want you to allow our teachers to be able to bank their leave days.
"We got away from doing that, but I absolutely believe that it will be beneficial to us, it will surely help in our absenteeism, and it will be beneficial to our teachers."
So -- I also want our Promise scholarship to be covered for vocational education.
"Now, there's a special project in West Virginia that's been amazingly special."
"You know, my wife Cathy, she's -- she's not involved like a scatter gun in every project known to man, but nobody is kinder, nobody is more directed, nobody is more sincere to communities and schools than Cathy."
"My salary -- if I didn't do this, she'd kill me."
"But my salary is all dedicated, 100 percent, to Communities in Schools."
"Now, Community -- Communities in Schools, I think in West Virginia, really started in Greenbrier County."
"Now, there was a lady that brought it there -- I think it was Emily Haas if I'm -- is that correct, Cathy?"
And really brought it when Bobby Haas was with the Dallas Cowboys and they moved back -- or to Greenbrier County.It is incredibly successful.It is unbelievably successful.
"Tonight, you're going to hear a lot of just this: We have got to refocus ourselves on our youth and some way steer them away from this horrible drug epidemic and help them become a work force that we've got to have in West Virginia."
"Now, the site coordinators working with kids in Communities in Schools do an unbelievable amount of work in a lot -- and they touch kids when they're having troubles, they're having all kinds of issues."
A lot of us maybe here don't realize just what they do and just how good they truly are.
"In Greenbrier County, I think they have 100 percent graduation rate."
"And today, we're only in about three or four counties within West Virginia, and we've expanded that since we've been here and since Cathy's gone to work on that."
"Tonight, I am calling for $5,000,000 within my budget to expand Communities in Schools statewide."
"And I've got a special presentation, because tonight -- and I -- and forgive me if I mispronounce, but if this gentleman could stand: Dale Erquiaga.Is that close?Is Dale with us tonight?Up here?"
"If Dale will stand, Dale is the guru of Communities in Schools."
And please give him a good round of applause.
"Now, also I've got one other smaller friend that from time to time -- you know, he and I kind of bingo off of one another and we enjoy each other's company a little bit, he's a good guy, he's real involved in Communities in Schools, and I think we're going to show -- wherever it may be -- over here, we're going to show a little video."
"(Video playing:) SHAQUILLE O'NEAL: Communities in Schools is an incredible program doing great work, and I'm glad to hear the sincerity and commitment to Communities in Schools."
"You know, it's very encouraging when an entire state gets behind a program like this, because it's all about helping one another.Thank you very much."
"Governor Jim, you know I love you.(Kisses) (Video ended."
"Shaq is really involved with Communities in Schools and does tremendous work, and he's a great friend, and don't be paying any attention to his kisses and love bit."
"But what a great, great, great person."
If I could jump from this to Commerce.
"The Department of Commerce today, we have new leadership.We have Ed Gaunch."
"Ed -- If I could say this about Ed, he brings -- he brings friendship; he brings respect, from you.He brings knowledge."
"He brings a lifetime of business wealth and experience to the table, and he's going to really help us."
I say this real quick: Don't think for a second that the China issue is off the table or the natural gas hub is gone.
"Today, like it or not like it, but we're still having a little bit of head-butting going on with the U. S. and China, and until the dust settles, you know, between our Presidents and everything, we're probably going to have a little head-butting going on, but they're still in touch all the time."
There's absolutely so much interest in West Virginia.
"We have so many possibilities for manufacturing and natural gas hub and expansion of our coal industry and on and on and on, tourism through the roof, and so many different things, that we need a great man like Ed - and we've got him - and I'm really proud to have him."
"Tonight I'd like to introduce one other person, Phil Dickinson."
"Now, Phil is here representing the British ambassador, and the British ambassador came just not long ago, and he's got all kinds of ideas and possibilities and things that they could bring to us right here from Europe, from England, and do great, great stuff as well."
"So wherever Phil is, if Phil would stand.Good to have you, Phil."
"Okay, if I could jump from there to tourism."
And tourism is another wonderfully bright spot in West Virginia.
"Wherever Chelsea Ruby is, I'd like her to stand.Is she -- where's Chelsea?Chelsea, great job.Great, great job.Unbelievable job."
"I mean, think about this -- I think that we could clearly say that in 2017, we had unbelievable growth."
We greatly surpassed the natural growth.
"In 2018, it looks even stronger and stronger."
Our hotel occupancy is up 11 percent.
"You know, our increased prices in revenue in our hotels is up 13.4 percent, and I will be asking you for another $14,000,000, because every dollar we put in tourism comes flooding back to us.It's a multiplier effect."
It's just absolutely a cash register.
"We put the money in, it comes flying right back at us."
We seeing this every month in our surpluses.
"This is the state that ought to be the number one state in the nation as far as tourism, and that young lady is doing one whale of a job.Thank you, again, Chelsea."
Now I've got to report real quickly about our state parks.
"We sold $60,000,000 of excess lottery bonds to upgrade our state parks."
We have absolutely been doing that.That's all underway right now.
"You know, we're getting a tremendous response with our state parks, and there's just lots and lots of good going on there."
"As far as our DNR efforts we've made, you know, we have reestablished an Elk herd in West Virginia; we're extending deer seasons."
"We're doing so many things with our trout and our streams, and we're exposing this state in so many ways, it's unbelievable."
"But now, let me just tell you one other thing that can be done."
"Now, a lot of people look at me like a three-headed monster when I told you things and you thought, no way, no way, coal severance tax aren't going to come back, this or that or whatever it may be."
"But I am telling you today, Austin Caperton, who is a leader beyond belief, is not with us today right now because he has been under the weather and he's had some surgery, and Austin will be back soon.We miss him.You talk about a super star."
"Now, he is a flat-out super star."
"But here's what I am going to ask Austin to do tomorrow, and that is just this: It's something that we need so badly within West Virginia, it's unbelievable."
"We need to develop multiple lakes within West Virginia, multiple lakes that can give us hydroelectric power -- which maybe we don't need, but at the same time, they can give us flood control."
We need the ability to develop those lakes.
"Do you know if you step back and think about it, four of the most beautiful seasons in the world, the most incredible people on the planet, the most unbelievable natural resources, and we're located within 600 miles of two-thirds of the people in the country."
The only thing we don't have is an ocean.
"Now, I am telling you, our state needs more developable lakes."
"It is a project that you may think is a pipe dream, but I am telling you, without any doubt, there is an infrastructure program about to be announced by our President, and we need to be at the line waiting."
Austin Caperton will lead the charge for us.
"Now, if I could switch to that -- from there to roads."
"Our Roads to Prosperity program, no one can deny, it's absolutely been a knock-it-out-of- the-park, home run, grand slam, grand slam."
"It's created all kinds of new jobs.Absolutely, it's working.It's working in every way."
We salute all the great people that made the licks and made it all work and made it all happen.
"Before I get into the last component of this, I'll say to the people out there in the world, the tolls on the turnpike are going to change to $4.00 in a couple of days, and we have pleaded with you, pleaded with you, to buy your E-Z passes that are going to cost you almost next to nothing."
"Now, the idea that Mountaineers -- now, others out of state can go too, but Mountaineers should go free."
And that's as close to free as we will ever be able to get.
You've got to go buy your E-Z Pass.
"We cannot make the horse drink, but we can take it to water, and we've taken you to water, so you have to go apply and buy your E-Z Pass."
"Now, we've got a terrible backlog with the E-Z Pass situation, and we almost caused the dog mess of all times."
"We could have been out there at the toll booths, you know, on January 1st writing people notes and saying, ""Well, you can go,"" ""You can't go."
"Before you know it, we'd have had traffic backed up to Pittsburgh."
"We figured it out and we got caught up, and we've had umpteen, umpteen people that put in all kinds of licks to get caught up."
"You know, my office, Parkways, everybody in the world, and we are caught up."
"So please, if you have not applied, apply."
"Now, back to our roads just a second."
"We've done -- I don't know how many, but it's hundreds of projects already."
"Here's the very thing, though, that we need to do: We've got to shift a little bit of the focus -- and we have had extensive discussions with the bond holders and everything else, that we can do this."
We've got to pull some of the money out of the bigger projects and move some of the money -- or significantly more money.
"Not more than all the big projects, but a little bit of additional moneys over to fix more of our secondary roads."
I'm glad to see you all get up.
I thought you were going to sleep.Okay.
"If I could have General Hoyer stand, if where -- where is General Hoyer."
"Okay, we're going to all stand again for this man."
"General, all I can say, for all of us and all of us as West Virginians, all of those as Americans, you talk about us having a super star in our midst, we all thank you.We all applaud you."
"You know, I think of so many things, whether it be RISE or whether it be just the -- just the fact that he's ready at any moment to lay his life down for all of us, absolutely this man and what he's done is unbelievable."
"You think about -- the Guard has brought in 300 jobs in the last year future -- or near past, and it's created an economic impact on the State of West Virginia of $361,000,000."
"A lot of times, that goes unnoticed."
"But in addition to all that, think about the Mountaineer Challenge Academy."
"Think about young men and women that are just absolutely lost, lost."
"Last year, they're going to have above a 90 percent graduation rate."
And those people are on their way.
"You know, so General, again, we all thank you in every way possible."
If I could speak of the RISE program just real quickly.We got a little bit diverted.
And the reason we got diverted is one thing.
And I'll talk a little bit about this in just a second.
"But you see, I came here, and I have never wanted a dime.Not a dime."
"I drive myself, put my own gas in.I don't want a dime."
"Absolutely now, it's tough to step up like that.Some people can't."
"But at the same time, when we get off track and it seems to me like that government is throwing away money or people are taking advantage or there's improprieties that look absolutely wrong, I'm going to be tough to deal with.That's all there is to it."
And we got going in a direction that we would have thrown away millions and millions and millions of dollars.
We had to stop for a minute or two.
And the General came to the rescue and stepped in.
"And tonight we have John and Grace Harris with us, and they are the first -- first stick-built home occupiers that we have now finished their home, and if they would stand, I'd love for you to give them an incredible round of applause.There's lots more to do."
"And the General's all over it, and there's lots and lots and lots more to do."
"There's dollars -- there's significant dollars out there that are at our fingertips, and we may be -- we may not be -- we may not have to have all the dollars for the flood victims, and we may be able to redirect some of the dollars and the economic recovery or redirect some of the dollars into something that I feel is a real pet peeve, and that is just this: You have a Senator in your midst tonight, a good man, that has been after this project for a long time, and that is some way tearing down these abandoned homes and abandoned buildings that scatter all over our state and clutter us in every way."
And so we're going to try to redirect some of those dollars and do just exactly that.
"Now, let me jump to the veterans.Our veterans, we owe all to.We all know that."
We are able to exempt their retirement.Good stuff.
"There's a few other things that we're able to do right now that you'll see in the budget, good stuff."
"But I can tell you just this: For any of us here that think that we don't owe every single thing that we have to our vets, we're just plain wrong.Dennis is here tonight."
"If Dennis would stand, let's give him a big round of applause."
"Okay, so we've done a bunch of stuff.You see my hand?"
My hand's got four fingers and a thumb.
"And sometimes your thumb can get in a lot of ways, get caught in a door or whatever it may be."
"But these fingers, if they were to represent our economy, education, our veterans and our roads, we've done pretty good on those four fingers."
"But every time we jam our hand in a glove, we hook our thumb, and it just won't go just right."
We keep just messing up and messing up and messing up.What's the last component?
"Now, there's lots and lots and lots of stuff still to do.But what's the last component?"
We've got to fix the drug problem.
We have to fix the drug problem.
We have to be committed enough to fix something that is absolutely cannibalizing us.
"Now, in Cabell County, we just had information that we reduced our overdoses by 40 percent."
"Marshall University, we started a Governor's Council on Substance Abuse Prevention."
"We have done lots of stuff, and we're making headway."
The very number one thing you had to have to get the drug problem halfway under control is jobs.But you know what?We're losing the battle.We're losing.
"Now, if you don't know that we're losing, get out there in the field and look and talk to people.We're losing."
So I'm going to ask you tonight to trust me.
"I'm going to propose a program to you right now, and I'm going to ask for your trust."
"You see, I would say to you just this: What would you do -- what would you do if you were in a baseball game or a softball game -- what would you do if the count was 3-2?"
What would you do if the bases were loaded?
The other team was at bat and your team was one run ahead.The bases are loaded.The other team's at bat.There's two outs.The count's 3-2.You're on second base.You're in right field.
"You're standing there pounding your glove, and you're saying -- as the pitch is on the way, are you saying, ""Please, Lord, don't let them hit me the because I'll muck it up."
"Or are you hitting your glove and saying, ""Please, Lord, have them hit me the ball.I'll make the play.I'll make the play.I want the ball."
"Well, you see, right now, I'm going to ask you for the ball."
"Now, I'm going to call this ""Jim's Dream,"" because I want it to be just that."
"I want it to be a dream that we can take our people off this terrible trail of terrible -- terrible drug trail, and we can put them in a job, and we can give them real live hope."
I'm going to tell you it's going to take some money to do this.
Not all the money in the world.
But let me just tell you -- and there's so many -- there's going to be so many opinions of what it -- how we ought to do this.
This is the most important thing that I'll talk to you about tonight.
"You know, there's going to be opinions, ""Well, we can do it at the community college,"" ""We can do it at the four-year schools,"" ""We can do it through the vo-tech,"" ""We can do it through education,"" we can do it through this, we can do it through that."
But I'm going to tell us just this: Just give me a chance.
"Just give me a chance to fix it.You know, I can get it done.I want the ball."
So if Rebecca will unveil this.
"The ""J"" is going to stand for ""jobs.The ""I"" is going to be ""in."
"The ""M"" is going to be ""making."
"And the little apostrophe is upside down, and we twisted it around to make a ""U.""Succeed."
"Now, looks a little funny, doesn't it?"
But it looks pretty much like I'd probably write.
But here's what I think we need to do: I think our best alternative today is the adult training -- or the adult learning educations in the education department.
The problem is just this -- and here's the problem: Nobody's really going today.
"The reason nobody's really going is not because it's not a good program, it is because - and I don't know how to speak of this any way but folksy, like you've heard me speak - it's not the real deal."
It's not real training that they can go get a real job.
"But what I'm going to ask you for is $5,000,000."
"$5,000,000 to put into prevention."
"I'm going to ask you for $10,000,000 to put into DHHR into treatment."
"I'm going to ask you for $10,000,000 for staffing and replacement and maintenance of equipment at the training centers, at the vo-tech centers."
"And then I'm going to ask you that if I -- if I'm an addict, and I go to treatment and I get better and then I go into some level of training and I get a certificate, that you will be able -- I will be able to take that to a court and get immediate expungement of a misdemeanor that I have."
"Not felonies, but a misdemeanor."
I want to tell you one more time how it's going to work.
"Through the surpluses that we have today, I want to take $20,000,000 out of those surpluses, through an appropriation, $20,000,000 out of their surpluses, and buy all the necessary equipment that I'm going to have to have at all of these centers to be able to do the level of training that I think needs to be done.Now, think about it."
You can't go learn how to drive a pickup truck and go to a surface mine job and tell them you can drive a 777 rock truck.
"You can't go to somewhere and learn how to tack weld and go to a -- you know, to an industrial site and say you're an industrial welder.These people can't get jobs.Let's just tell it like it is.They can't get jobs."
"And if we lay -- if we lay the burden on our continue -- on our ongoing budget, we lay a burden on that we say we need $50,000,000 ongoing to be able to perpetuate a program like this, we don't need that.We don't need that."
"It's time to start to be able to have the equipment onsite to be able to teach the welding, to teach the electrician stuff, to teach the heavy equipment operation, to teach and build our work force."
"You know, I heard it 10,000 times."
I don't know how to say it any better.
"Companies all over the place come in my office and they talk and they talk and they talk and then they say, ""Well, you don't have a qualified work force here."
I don't know how in the world we can come here.
"The other thing: ""You've got people who can't pass a drug test."
"I say, why don't we train them?"
Why don't we train people to do something?Why aren't we training people?
"Why don't we absolutely, some way, somehow, let our people that are struggling on drugs beyond belief go get treatment and go get treatment for free, provided that they'll come out of treatment and go into some level of training and provided they'll take constant drug tests?"
Why don't we absolutely train our work force and give those people hope?I don't get it.
"Now, we have too many ideas, too many ideas.Let me fail.Let me fail.Give me the ball.Just let me fail."
"Absolutely, I promise you, I'll run across the finish line, and I won't fail."
Our State Police had our first cadet class not long ago.
We just started on Monday our second cadet class.
"They need a few dollars to update the forensic lab, and I've got that in the budget.Child welfare is a real issue."
"Of course, everyone knows my commitment and how I feel about kids."
"Foster care, we're really upside down, and we've got to figure out the foster care crisis, and I'm going to challenge all of you all to bring me -- bring me solutions."
Bring me answers of what we can do.
"I want to begin immediately -- I want to take $10,000,000 directly out of the surplus moneys that we have now, and I've got $5,000,000 in the budget to immediately build back the Anthony Correctional Center.We need it built back."
"As far as medical cannabis, we need to solve the riddle, guys.We're running out of time."
"There's a lot of people out there that are hurting, and they could probably very well use medical cannabis."
I want everyone here to understand -- I want everyone here to understand this and understand me loud and clear.
"I am adamantly, adamantly, etched in stone, adamantly against recreational marijuana."
Today -- and this is the fun stuff.
"Today, I'm requesting the elimination of the business inventory machinery tax."
"Since the first day I came, I'm a business guy.I haven't changed.I'll tell you the truth.I'll tell you what I think."
I think -- and I make mistakes.I'm a business guy.
"I know that wherever we can, we look for -- and we found waste upon waste upon waste that we've been able to cut out."
"We found ways to streamline government, and now today, we can streamline even more."
We have found 2007 jobs in government today that have not been filled in the last year.
"They have been vacant for a year, and we want to eliminate them all."
"Now, I don't mean this in any way to sound like a tough guy or whatever, but I meant it when I said that as far as -- I've done this job for nothing."
"And if you're going to do something for nothing and put your heart in it, you're not going to stand back and stand there comfortably with your buddies and your friends wasting money and just have everybody on the dole and think it's okay.It's not okay."
"And whenever I can find it, I'm going to uncover it."
"And when I uncover it, I'm going to try to do something about it."
"Tonight, we have another special person with us.She's with the AARP.Her name is Gaylene Miller."
"And if Gaylene could stand, wherever Gaylene is."
"And Gaylene, don't sit back down, Gaylene."
"Stand, if you would, just for one second."
"Because together, you and I and all this great body -- I have sent up, and now today -- today is the time for us to eliminate the tax on Social Security.(Bell rang.Oh."
Was that one of your members that was ringing that bell?Okay.
"Let me just say this, that what we're going to do in regard to Social Security is two things."
We're going to give you a choice.
"If you want the $8,000 deduction, you can keep that."
You can't keep -- have them both.
"If you don't want that and you want totally exempt on your Social Security from State income tax, you've got that.Your choice."
It's time to create an Intermediate Court of Appeals in West Virginia.
It's another step forward to instill -- to restoring honor and integrity back to the court system.
"I've just got a couple more, and I'll go quickly."
"Not long ago, our mine rescue teams, they brought three people out of a mine, and all of us know that without any question, they had no business being in the mine."
All of us know that maybe we just need to stiffen our laws even more to make it more of a deterrent for them to go.I'm all for that.I am 100 percent for that.
But I would tell you just this: They're our brothers and our sisters.They were in there.
"And just think, the mine rescuers -- I said, ""Can you tell me -- can you tell me they're not there?"
"Can you tell me that it's unsafe to go and try again?"""
"And they said, ""We can't tell you that."
"But we feel like that it's not -- it's not unsafe, and we could go, but we don't think that they're alive,"" or ""We really don't think that they're there."
"But they weren't willing to quit, and neither was I."
"And lo and behold, we brought them out of there.Your brothers.Your sisters."
They shouldn't have been there in the first place.
But just think: What if we had not gone back?
What would have happened to those people?
And if you can live with this -- I can't.
"We went back and we did exactly what my dad always said to do: ""Damn you, there's always something you can do, and you better damn well always remember that."
"We went back, and we found them."
"If we hadn't have gone back, you know what we would have done?"
We would have taken a D11 bulldozer and we would have pushed dirt against the mine opening so tight that there's no way somebody could get into the mine.
And what would have happened to those people?They had water; they had air.
They would have set there until they starved to death.Starved to death.
That's what would have happened to them.We found them.
They shouldn't have been there.
"We should make the laws tougher, but we should celebrate that West Virginians found them.I couldn't be any more proud."
"Now, I'll end by just telling you this: There's a guy not long ago, he set in my office and he said, ""What about this job keeps you up?"
"What about this job keeps you up at night?"""
"Well, I'll surprise you when I tell you this: What keeps me up is just this: Too many people out there, too many people out there still haven't heard the news."
"Too many of our people, no question, are still hurting."
But too many of our people believe still that they really just should be 50th and stay 50th.
"By God, you should know your place."
Too many of our people need to hear the good things that we're doing.
Too many of our people need to pull the rope all together with us.
They want to be -- they want to feel good.
They want to feel joy in what they do.
"Now, let me tell you just this, and this is all there is to it: I came to you again wanting nothing; I came to you just as a man that had incredible experience, a man who's probably made so many mistakes, maybe as many mistakes as there is in this room, and I've learned from them.I've done all kinds of stuff.You learn."
"I've got a tremendous amount of wisdom, and absolutely, I would challenge every single person here to know that all I want to do is help."
"All I want to do is try to do all the good that can be done for our people, and whether I'm here on this planet two more days or with you two more years or with you six more years, I would say ""Use me."
"I'm a resource that can be used, and I'm a resource that can help.Now, I think big."
I think create -- with a lot of creativity.
"Absolutely, look at my track record.I'm not going to let you down."
I'm absolutely not going to let you down.
So at the end of the day -- I've said this over and over and over.
I meant it when I came here and said everything that I just got through telling you.
I meant it when I said over and over and over that all I've ever really wanted for this state is goodness and its people.That's all I want.
"And I meant it when I said to the people, and I've said to you, that I love you.And I do."
"So with that, I'd say God bless you, and thank you again for having me, and let's get to work and do great work.Thank you all."
