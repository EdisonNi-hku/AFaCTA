SENTENCES
"Majority Leader Currie, President Philip, Leader Daniels, Leader Jones, Justices of the Supreme Court, My fellow constitutional officers, My colleagues in the General Assembly, And my fellow citizens of Illinois: I always enjoy coming into this chamber, but it has been even more enjoyable since I have been governor and have had the great pleasure of addressing this joint session.Today is no exception."
But today I come with a rush of mixed emotions.
This will be the last time I will present this body – and the people of Illinois – with a budget for the state.
And it may be the last time I will get to address you as governor.
"As you know, I spent 10 years here, and I have always had great respect for the work you do and the potential to do good things that help people and change lives."
I have seen it happen here many times and the memories fill me with satisfaction.
"The work is hard, the emotions sometimes frayed, but in the end it makes you feel good about public service.It is a higher calling."
"I would like to take a minute, if I could, for a point of personal privilege."
"When I leave office next January, I will have been elected 10 times to state office over 30 years, thanks to many of you in this chamber and others throughout the state.Thank you for 30 great years."
"I also have been very fortunate to have a devoted, understanding and loving family by my side for every second of those 30 years."
The best thing I ever did was to marry Lura Lynn.
She is a wonderful partner and a devoted mother and grandmother.
Today I am proud again to introduce to you my family.
The First Lady of Illinois – Lura Lynn – thanks for all you have done for me and for the people of Illinois.
"Nancy and John Coughlan, and their children: Ann, John, Mary Cate, Nora and Elizabeth."
"Michael and Lynda Fairman; with Michael, Kristen, Kathryn and our youngest granddaughter, MacKenzie Rose."
"Jeff and Julie Koehl, with Lauren, Alex and Molly."
"Nick and Joanne Barrow, with Andrea and Nick."
"Jim and Jeanette Schneider; and last, our son, George, Jr."
Thank you for all your support and love.
Our great state is a much different place than it was when we last met here.
Times have changed – that’s a fact.
The events of the last 12 months have forever altered our future.
I believe we all understand that.
The challenges before us are great.
So we must continue to work together as we have for the past three years.
Today I present you with my final budget and my final report on the state of our state.
"The Fiscal Year 2003 budget I propose today is lean, fair, and balanced."
"And because of the progress we have made over the last three years, the state of our state is stronger than ever before."
This budget contains no tax increases.
Today I want to talk about the accomplishments we’ve achieved together and about the challenges that remain before us.
Do you remember where we started from three years ago?Let me remind you.
Seated in the gallery with us today is someone who has a huge stake in this budget.
"I’d like to introduce you to Jonathan Reed-Wood, of Springfield."
Jonathan is three years old and was born in January of 1999 – the month that I took office as governor.
"He represents all of the children in Illinois that have been born in the last three years, and all of the children who live in Illinois."
"Before he was born, our state faced many daunting challenges."
"Three years ago, some 3,600 of the 4,200 school buildings in this state were in urgent need of repairs or upgrades."
"Many of our children were being taught in hallways, boiler rooms and broom closets."
"Three years ago, our state had not built a single mile of new highway since the 1980s."
"Traffic congestion, at places like the Hillside Strangler, was becoming intolerable."
"Three years ago, some of our elevated transit structures that carry hundreds of thousands of commuters every day were crumbling, and some bridges were over a hundred years old."
"Three years ago, Illinois ranked a miserable 48th among all the states in the amount of park and recreation land set aside for public use and future generations."
Illinois ranked worse – 49th – among all the states in the use of technology to deliver government services.
"In 1999, nearly 200,000 of our children in this state were uninsured, lacking coverage for even basic health care."
"Three years ago, surveys showed that some 40 percent of our citizens over age 65 had no prescription drug coverage and had to struggle every day to find the money to pay for the medication they needed."
"More than 10 percent of our seniors said they simply did without, or cut the dosages their doctors prescribed."
"When I took office, our social service agencies lacked the funding necessary to expand the reach of their offerings to provide children and the elderly, single parents, the working poor and the disabled with essential programs to improve their quality of life."
"But since Jonathan was born, we’ve addressed those challenges, and we’ve overcome them."
Let’s take a moment to look beyond the rhetoric and the criticism of shallow naysayers that we hear everyday and look at our record of accomplishment.
"Together, we made the children of Illinois our highest priority – period."
"During Jonathan’s lifetime, we’ve done a lot of great things for his generation."
"With the budget I’m presenting to you today, we will increase state support for education by $1.45 billion to record levels of funding, just like we said we would."
"During his lifetime, we’ve built almost 12,000 new classrooms – 244 brand new schools and 2,800 renovations and additions."
"During his lifetime, we’ve hired more than 10,000 new teachers, just like we said we would."
"During his lifetime, we’ve invested $150 million in computer hardware and software for classrooms."
"Just like we said we would, we’ve linked every school district in this state to the Illinois Century Network, providing students with a fast connection to the wonders of the Internet."
"When he is ready, he will be able to attend the nation’s top-ranked system of higher education."
"And if he needs help paying for college, financial aid will be there."
"Since 1999, state government has helped one out of every five college students in Illinois pay their tuition.That’s a great thing."
"During his lifetime, we have boosted funding for health care and human services to more than $10 billion per year – and we’ve kept it at that level."
"While he has been alive, KidCare enrollments have increased by 500 percent."
Fewer teenagers are having babies.
And more of our children are graduating from high school.
Infant mortality rates have gone down.
"Less children are living in poverty, and fewer are being abused and neglected."
"The number of children in state-subsidized day care has grown substantially, enabling their parents to find and keep good jobs."
"In his lifetime, we’ve boosted state funding for child immunizations and health screenings, so this year more than 1.1 million children get a good start in life."
"Over the last three years, Illinois has led the nation in arranging permanent adoptions for at-risk children and in reducing the number of kids in temporary care."
"While he has been alive, we’ve boosted funding by more than 25 percent for substance abuse treatment and prevention services."
And our state ranks 9th among the 50 states in how we’re using our share of the nationwide tobacco settlement to battle smoking.That’s a very good thing.
"During the lifetime of this three-year-old, we helped 100,000 people move from welfare to work."
"We initiated the first-ever state-level Earned Income Tax Credit in Illinois to help 700,000 of the working poor."
We developed the toughest rules in the nation against predatory lending practices.
"We negotiated an HMO reform package, including a patients’ bill of rights, to help the 3 million people covered by HMOs."
"We provided 400,000 low-income senior citizens with prescription drug coverage so they no longer have to simply “do without."
"And we helped 320,000 low-income households with heating assistance – at an average of $500 per household."
We can all be proud of the fact that Illinois is the top state in supporting this program.
"LIHEAP has had no greater champion in the Illinois General Assembly than our friend and colleague, Senator John Maitland."
"I’m happy to announce, that from this day forward, the program will be named the “Senator John Maitland LIHEAP” program.God bless you, John."
"We’ve reclaimed 5,600 acres of urban “brownfields” and provided record funding -- $1.5 billion – to help local communities improve drinking water supplies and wastewater treatment."
"During their lifetime, we’ve graduated 383 new troopers from the State Police Academy."
We enacted common-sense laws to fight gun violence in our neighborhoods.
We doubled the number of parole officers.
And we took back control of our prisons from gangs.
"We dramatically improved law enforcement technology, moving Illinois from 35th among the states to first in just three years."
"And, we initiated a good, hard look at the fairness of our state’s criminal justice system."
We are absolutely committed to creating a system that is fair to everyone and concerned about justice for all – a system that has no tolerance for error.
"And finally, together over these last three years we’ve transformed government."
"Through Illinois FIRST, we invested $137 million in public safety equipment, facilities and vehicles – all to help keep our homes, schools and neighborhoods safe and capable of withstanding a natural disaster."
"And, instead of ranking 49th in the use of technology, late last year we were named the top “digital state” in the nation – the best state in the union."
From worst to first in just three years – that’s quite an accomplishment.
We’ve improved state services and made government more efficient.
"We’ve eliminated 385 obsolete portions of state statutes, 1,500 unnecessary sections of the administrative code and by the time we’re through, I will recommend the elimination of 100 unnecessary boards and commissions."
"And, during the lifetime of this child, our economic development policies have led to more than $8.9 billion in new investments by companies in Illinois – and the creation or retention of more than 104,000 new jobs."
"I’m very pleased and proud to report to you that next week, Site Selection magazine, a trade publication for private developers, will announce that Illinois has the best economic development programs in the nation."
"We’ll be taking the crown – the number one ranking – away from Michigan, which has held the title for the last four years."
These are among the many good things that we have accomplished during Jonathan’s life.
His life -- and the lives of other children are better today -- because we worked together and decided their lives would be better.
"Unfortunately, if you listen to some of the commercials on TV, you might get the impression that we’ve accomplished nothing during the past three years."
But this budget also presents us – as the stewards of the people’s government – with many challenges as we begin 2002.
"As Abraham Lincoln once said, “the occasion is piled high with difficulty."
But we have never been afraid of difficulty – or a challenge.
Our primary challenge in this year’s budget is to make sure that Jonathan’s world gets a little better.
This budget proposal allows us to do that.
"Every year that I have served the people as governor, I have asked all of you – Republican and Democrat -- to join me in building a “New Illinois."
"Each year, I have asked you to put partisanship aside and place the common good of the people and our state foremost in your actions."
"Sometimes, that has been a challenge."
But we always have succeeded in finding a common ground that resolves our differences.
"Today, one more time, I renew my invitation and – again – extend my hand in friendship."
Let’s all work together to do great things for Illinois.
The first challenge presented by this budget is making sure that state spending fits in with less-than-robust revenue collections that have drained this year’s available resources.
That means we’re going to have to tighten our belts.
"But having said that, I want to make it clear that this government has not been spending wildly, as some have charged."
Many of the sound bites I hear from the campaign trail are anything but sound.
"As Lincoln said, “he has the right to criticize who has the heart to help."
We have a balanced budget because we have kept our spending under control.
National reports show that government spending in Illinois has been below the national average for the last two years.
"If you include the Fiscal Year 2003 budget I’m presenting to you today, the four-year average annual growth in state spending has been only 3.5 percent."
"And, this administration is the only administration in the last 30 years – since 1972 – to propose four straight budgets that will pay for an entire year’s bills with the same year’s revenue."
"Since I took office, we have never had to borrow from future revenues."
That’s an unprecedented record.
"But as we begin to debate this budget, I would remind you that last May this General Assembly approved a budget that was $1.2 billion more than the budget I submitted to you in February."
"If that happens again this year, I will veto the entire budget.You can take that to the bank."
"The other factor making a balanced budget more difficult is the continued large increase in health care spending, particularly in the Medicaid program."
"Last year, Medicaid spending across the country rose by an average of 11 percent."
"Because of the cost controls we enacted since December of 2000, we were able to keep our growth in Medicaid for the year to 6.4 percent."
"Nonetheless, we still spend almost $8 billion a year on Medicaid."
"Since I took office, we have increased the amount of money we spend on Medicaid – to doctors, pharmacies and especially hospitals – by $1.2 billion."
That increase is more than what we’ve given to education in the last three years.
It’s one of the biggest parts of the budget.
"But this year is just like last year, and the experts expect that Medicaid spending in Fiscal Year 2003 will continue to rise."
"The cuts we have made in Medicaid last year – and this year – have been distasteful for many of us, but they have been necessary to keep our entire budget in balance and under control."
And the amount we spend is still $1.2 billion higher than what we were spending in 1999.
"The challenge to us created by these factors is difficult, but not insurmountable."
"Here’s how I propose to do it: As I prepared this budget, I simply did what I asked you to help me with in January: I cut 3 percent more out of each agency’s existing budget, for a total 5 percent reduction across the board."
"The “base” upon which we start the process for FY 2003 is $22.3 billion, or 5 percent less than the level of appropriations for the current year that we agreed to last May."
Lowering the spending “base” cannot be done without pain.
"To begin with, this budget is predicated on the lowest state employee headcount in more than a decade – 62,000 positions."
"That means downsizing our workforce by 3,800 positions.I don’t like saying that.I won’t like doing that."
But I will do that to insure the fiscal stability of this state.
"My hope is that the majority of these changes can be accomplished through attrition, aided by an early retirement program for qualified state employees."
"I will work with you and the unions representing our employees, on the exact details of such a plan."
But it is my expectation that we can save the state treasury as much as $50 million with an early retirement program in place.
That projected $50 million is money that we can add back into other programs.
"Secondly, this state budget calls for the downsizing of state facilities."
"In most cases, these facilities represent some of the oldest and most costly infrastructure that we have."
"As I did last fall with the ancient Joliet Correctional Center, the time is right to consolidate our operations in more modern facilities."
I propose closing the Vienna Correctional Center and the Valley View Youth Center in St. Charles and moving the inmate populations to other facilities.
Some staff from those facilities will be able to transfer to other jobs in the corrections system.
"Also, I propose that we delay the opening of the new maximum security prison in Thomson for another year to avoid absorbing the costs of opening that prison."
Closing these facilities is made possible because of a prison population that is not growing as fast as it has in the past.
"The budget for 2003 allows us to open more than 3,900 new beds at the new Lawrence Correctional Center in Southern Illinois, the new reception and classification center in Joliet, and new youth centers in Kewanee and Rushville."
We will also downsize at the Department of Human Services as part of our long-term goal of changing the way the agency provides services to the mentally ill and the developmentally disabled.
We will continue to change our state facilities to a point where as many of the residents as possible can have a greater say in the care that they receive and where as many as possible can be housed in community-based living arrangements.
This budget includes funding for 310 new positions in CILAs – Community Integrated Living Arrangements – that help the developmentally disabled live away from traditional state facilities.
"In doing that, I propose that we close the Zeller Mental Health Center in Peoria and the developmental disability unit at the Singer Mental Health Center in Rockford."
These changes coincide with my previously announced decision to downsize the civil commitment section of the Elgin Mental Health Center.
"Again, all of the residents affected by these decisions will be placed in other appropriate care settings, and many staff members will be able to stay on within the DHS system."
"As I have said for months, I have been available to talk with AFSCME and all of the labor unions that represent state employees about ways we can possibly avert layoffs and other budget reductions."
"I have been willing to discuss options, as governors in other states have done successfully."
"In Iowa recently, the state’s major unions, including AFSCME, opened their contract and agreed to a temporary wage freeze in order to prevent layoffs."
"To date, our discussions with most labor unions in Illinois have been very helpful in mitigating our budget situation."
"My thanks go out to Teamsters in all parts of this state, the Illinois Federation of Public Employees, our craft and trade unions, the Illinois Nurses Association and other groups for stepping up to the plate and taking responsible actions."
I will never understand union leaders who would rather see their members laid off than consider temporary contract changes that would allow people to keep their jobs.
We still have an opportunity to discuss these options as we continue to develop this budget.
I’ve told you about the big cuts.
But the spending reductions will go deeper than that.
"The cuts I am imposing at the start of the 2003 budget process will affect every agency and will reach into many, many programs."
You will find the detail in the budget book.
Most areas of state government will have to do more with less.
These cuts are not going to be popular.
"To soften the blow somewhat, I propose that we enact this year a temporary tax amnesty similar to the successful program the state initiated during the 1980s."
It is estimated that we can generate $35 million in one-time revenues that we can use to mitigate further spending reductions.
"In identifying the new money that is available for us to spend, I have carefully considered where we should direct these precious resources."
Not every agency can be treated equally.Our schools get more money.
Corrections will get more money.
Our commitment to state employees’ health insurance costs requires more money.
And human service programs will get more money.
We will have disagreements about where state funds should be spent.
But I’m confident that we will be able to reach a common ground.We must set priorities.
And I have done my best to keep my priorities as close as possible to those that you and I have agreed on during the past three years: Education.The future of our families.
Public safety and homeland security.
"For the fourth year in a row, education and workforce training is my top priority."
I will not bend on that commitment.
The economists project that during Fiscal Year 2003 we will see state tax revenues grow by $480 million.
"And, in keeping with a pledge I made four years ago, I propose that our schools get $245 million of that new revenue."
That’s 51 percent of all new state revenues.
But that’s not enough for education in my book.
"For years in Illinois, we have struggled with the funding disparity that exists between school districts, a disparity caused by a funding system tied directly to land values."
"This disparity creates a huge and unfair gap between the “haves,” or schools in areas where property values are high and rising, and the “have-nots,” or schools where land values are low and stagnant."
"For years we in Illinois have tried to bridge this gap and to raise the “foundation level,” or the amount of money we guarantee for every public school student in the state."
"Since 1999, we have raised the foundation level by $335, or about $111 per year."
I propose that we undertake the most historic change in school funding for decades in Illinois.
"To provide our local schools with greater flexibility in how to spend the dollars we provide them, I propose that we consolidate 22 separate grant programs and put all of those resources – about $500 million – into the General State Aid distributive formula."
"That would have the effect of raising the “foundation level” per student to almost $5,000 – an increase of about $400."
"This commitment, supplemented by $222 million in new federal funds, will provide almost $4 billion for local school districts for them to allocate on priorities they establish at the local level."
"Contrary to what you may have read, we are not cutting this money out of the budget.It’s still there."
We’re giving school districts the money without all of hassles of paperwork.
We’re giving local school boards the power to make decisions at the local level for the students in their schools.
"We’re giving school districts money to teach, rather than money to process paper."
"Right now, to access the money available in those grant programs, school districts apply to go to the State Board of Education.That’s too much red tape."
By cutting that bureaucracy we can shift $20 million from administrative costs right into our classrooms.
"Most of the 22 grant programs are used by school districts to keep pace with state and federal accountability standards in reading, bilingual education, math, science, truant and dropout programs and gifted education."
"And with the enactment last month of President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” act, every school district will have more reasons to meet these standards."
"If schools don’t meet those standards, they are placed on an academic watch list and parents have the right to transfer their children to another school."
"Under the proposal in this year’s budget, we’ll be giving school districts the flexibility and the funding to meet the needs of their students."
"As I said, the new federal education act places a larger burden on school districts to perform."
So I’ve directed the State Board of Education to develop an implementation strategy that puts our state accountability standards into synch with those in federal law.
We have a few years to make whatever changes are necessary.
But it’s important that our schools begin this transition process this year.
The State Board will report back to you and me this summer with recommendations on what Illinois needs to do to comply with testing requirements and learning standards for our children.
"I am confident that our students, their parents – and our teachers – are up to the challenge."
In the gallery with us today are two of Illinois’ finest teachers.
They represent all of the teachers in Illinois who work hard every day with our children and grandchildren.
"Ms Anne Davis, the president of the Illinois Education Association, and Peter Rapinchuk of Tinley Park, who is one of the 500 nationally-certified teachers we currently have in Illinois."
Peter teaches at Andrew High School in Chicago’s suburbs.
The number of nationally certified teachers in Illinois – the highest achievement for a classroom teacher -- has grown from a total of 37 in the last three years.
This budget allows us to continue building those numbers.
"Please join me in saluting Ann, Peter and the teachers of Illinois – our partners in shaping a good future for our state."
"We’ve made great progress in improving education in this state over the past three years, but challenges remain."
We still have the challenge of providing quality preschool education for every three-and-four-year-old child whose parents choose it.
"We need to address that issue this year, and with this budget, we will."
Some of you will say we can’t afford to do it – not this year.
I say -- we can’t afford to wait.
We know that children who start school behind their peers are unlikely ever to catch up.
We see widening gaps in educational achievement that permanently limit economic and social opportunities.
We know that children who fail to read at grade level by the end of the third grade are most likely to drop out before graduating from high school.
"We know that far, far too many preschool children spend their time in settings that do not improve their school readiness and do not take full advantage of their capacity to learn."
"This month, I received the report from the Task Force I appointed to examine this issue; a task force chaired by the First Lady."
They point out that we simply cannot continue to ignore this issue.
The new federal accountability standards will require our schools and our students to meet learning standards.
"Without a comprehensive early learning program, we risk being unable to meet those standards."
Included in my proposed budget is $6 million for the State Board of Education to begin a program for universal access to preschool in Illinois.
"With us in the gallery today is Ms Jill Bradley, director of programs at the Carole Robertson Center of Chicago."
"Today, she represents all of the state’s preschool teachers, who work hard every day to help our children open their eyes to learning."
Ms Bradley will tell you that the children who enroll in a quality preschool program do better in school and in life.
"She will tell you that a study done of preschool children in Chicago indicates that for every dollar we spend on quality preschool programs, we save $7 down the road in police and jail costs, remedial education and health care as these children grow up."
Please help me welcome Ms Bradley.
"Our education agenda for the coming year also includes more than $15 million to start developing programs that help with the recruitment, mentoring and continued training of teachers at all levels."
These are the recommendations of a summit meeting on education that I convened late last year at the mansion.
"Even though the teaching ranks in Illinois have increased by more than 10,000 in the last three years, estimates show that we’re going to need more than 50,000 new teachers within the next few years."
"But the teacher attrition rate is about 23 percent during the first three years of teaching, and we don’t graduate enough teachers to fill all of those jobs."
"That’s why it’s important that we step in and help recruit quality candidates for the classroom, guide them when they begin their careers and make sure that they have every opportunity to develop professionally."
"We also will maintain funding for our successful “Jobs for Illinois Graduates” program, which helps high school students succeed in life."
"We will continue to support charter schools, which give parents a needed choice in how, where and what their children will learn."
"Our on-line education programs, the Illinois Virtual High School and the Illinois Virtual Campus, continue to show enrollment growth, and we should continue to expand those programs next year."
"To help maintain our status as the top-ranked system of higher education in the nation, we will continue to fund learning, research and public service at all of our state universities and community colleges."
"I recommend funding for scholarships that will help more than 185,000 students attend college during the next year."
"Last week, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission was able to expand the number of Monetary Award grants to 7,000 more students."
Most of these students now eligible for a MAP scholarship are low-income adults who are attending a community college in search of new skills or the training they need to get a better job.
"In addition, this budget provides important funding for all of our job training programs, and for our automated “skills match” system which has helped link up approximately 30,000 job seekers with potential employers through a statewide database."
The second priority that you and I have agreed on over the last three years is the need to support and enrich our families – especially children and seniors.
"Even with limited resources this fiscal year, in this budget we will be able to expand our safety net of services for people in Illinois who need our help the most."
"What we are able to offer citizens this year is an historic array of programs that will provide more comprehensive and better health care for an estimated 770,000 low-income men, women and children from the cradle to the rocking chair."
"This budget includes KidCare, our health insurance program for low-income children, funding for a “FamilyCare” initiative to extend health benefits to the families of these children, and “SeniorCare” a new pharmaceutical assistance program for the elderly that will be a model for the nation to follow."
"Thanks to the commitment we have shown together to disadvantaged children, KidCare enrollments now top 177,000."
That’s a great achievement in just three years.
"My administration continues to negotiate with the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver of federal rules that will allow us to use our unspent money from the KidCare program to create “FamilyCare” and extend health coverage to as many as 200,000 adults in Illinois."
The eligible men and women will be the parents of children covered by KidCare.
"I’ve said for years that FamilyCare is a good idea, if we can find a way to pay for it, and I’m confident that the funding mechanism we’ve outlined to the federal government will enable us to capture federal dollars that will pay for the bulk of the program."
"And the crowning achievement of our comprehensive health care system is the new SeniorCare program, which will begin in June."
"Under this program, as many as 400,000 low-income seniors in Illinois will be eligible for assistance in purchasing prescription drugs at low cost."
"This program, an expansion of our existing “circuit breaker” for seniors, has been hailed by the Bush Administration as model that should be copied in other states."
"With us in the gallery today is Ms. Lola Johnson of Bloomington, who joined us last month here in Springfield to announce the SeniorCare program."
"Here’s how SeniorCare is going to help Mrs. Johnson and 400,000 others."
"Let’s say she needs three prescription drugs every day, drugs that cost her $150 per month, or about $1,800 per year."
"Under this new program, Mrs. Johnson will pay about $100 a year in co-payments and that’s it."
"Under this new program, she will save about $1,700 in a year."
"No longer will these seniors have to decide between food, shelter or medicine."
"Mrs. Johnson, thank you for your support."
Our commitment in this budget to the less fortunate does not stop with health care for the needy.
"Even though we expect the number of TANF cases to drop to 48,000 in the next year – a record low – this still means that there are more than 40,000 families in Illinois who need our direct assistance to find shelter, food and clothing."
"And because we have seen the number of TANF cases drop dramatically in the last eight years, in this budget we will be able to provide these needy families with the first increase in the TANF grant in more than a decade."
"We will be able to fund an average 10 percent increase in the TANF grant for families, which currently stands at $377 per month to a single parent and two children."
"In tough times, we should not be tough on the poor.That is wrong."
This budget also calls for an expansion of our innovative “Illinois Workforce Advantage” program.
"The IWA initiative helps disadvantaged communities find and implement the right mix of state services and programs to help advance economic development, health care and education."
"The IWA program has been successful this year in six communities in Chicago, the suburbs, East St. Louis and deep Southern Illinois."
I propose in this budget that we expand the IWA system to a few more areas of the state and continue a multi-year process that makes our state agencies more of an active partner in the revitalization of depressed areas.
"This budget will continue our strong commitment to anti-smoking programs, policies that earned us a top-ten ranking in tobacco prevention efforts."
"Other public health initiatives include a continued emphasis on expanding health services for women, telemedicine programs to bring up-to-date services to rural areas and screenings and immunizations for children – programs that help more than one million children every year."
"We will live up to a commitment we agreed to three years ago and continue this year to expand health care services to more of our most needy citizens – the aged, blind and disabled."
"In this budget we will bring our coverage to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, enabling 93,000 more people to get state help in meeting their needs."
Funding for assisting in adoptions and permanent placements through the Department of Children and Family Services is increased by $20 million in this budget.
"In the last three years, DCFS has become a national model in the area of helping troubled families and at-risk children find safety, security and the path to a better life."
"Lastly, the recommended budget for human services continues our three-year effort to boost the wages of home care workers for seniors and the disabled."
We have taken huge steps during this administration to bring the salaries of these very difficult jobs more into line with others who give their love and dedication to the less fortunate.
"With the wage increase I propose in this budget, over four years we will have provided a 21 percent increase in pay for the Department on Aging’s Community Care program and a 25 percent increase for personal assistants in the Home Services program run by DHS."
"But just as this budget continues to safeguard the human infrastructure of Illinois, we must strengthen our borders and the defenses we have in place to prevent and deal with a natural disaster or a man-made terrorist attack."
This is another top budget priority we have identified for our state.
"Over the last four years, we have been reminded again and again about the importance of our emergency response programs and our homeland security systems."
The challenge of natural disasters underscores the importance we have placed in buying new public safety equipment for towns big and small in every part of Illinois.
"Through the Illinois FIRST program, you and I have allocated $137 million for emergency equipment, fire and police stations, communications gear and vehicles – all with the goal of keeping the people safe."
"This spring, the federal government has stepped in with $37 million that we will use to continue our security efforts – training, emergency equipment, medicines and public awareness."
"We are fully capable and ready to respond to biological dangers, a natural disaster or a terrorist attack in any of the state’s 102 counties."
"The budget I am recommending also includes $383 million in funding for the Illinois State Police, an allocation that includes two new state trooper cadet classes totaling 100 new officers, and continued work on the STARCOM statewide voice communications system."
"Also in the State Police budget are additional funds to hire 80 more forensic scientists, part of our three-year commitment to expand the state’s capabilities in quickly processing evidence in criminal cases, especially when that evidence involves DNA."
"This spring, I expect that my commission on Capital Punishment will issue its much-awaited report."
"More than two years ago, I said that because we had come so close to the ultimate nightmare – the state taking the life of an innocent person on 13 different occasions – I had no choice but to declare a moratorium on executions in Illinois."
"Despite the fact that again and again our justice system has proven to be flawed, this General Assembly has twice sought to expand capital punishment to include more offenses."
Twice I have used my constitutional authority to veto those attempts.
"Because of our shameful record of sending innocent people to death row, it is my duty and my moral obligation to stand my ground."
"The more I see of the system, the more troubled I become."
"Where I once believed the system was flawless, I now know the justice machine can – and has – failed us."
"And when it comes to capital punishment, no margin for error is acceptable."
I don’t know what my commission will report or what conclusions I will draw after reviewing their findings.
"I only know this, as I said when I declared the moratorium: Until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent person will be sentenced to die in Illinois, no one will meet that fate on my watch."
There are certain basic issues regarding justice and fairness that define who we are as individuals and as a society.
"You cannot be for a justice system that has the potential of taking an innocent life – or support a system while it does not allow each man and woman the same basic rights and privileges, or discriminates on the basis of color, creed, race, gender, disability of sexual orientation."
"It’s time we amend our statutes – not to allow special rights or privileges – but equal protection to all our citizens – white black, brown or yellow, male, female, straight and gay.It is time.Send me House Bill 101."
"The three priorities of this budget – education, the future of our families and homeland security – will improve the lives of many, many people in Illinois."
"But this spending plan for Fiscal Year 2003 also continues our work in other vital areas – environmental protection, economic development, agriculture, technology and infrastructure improvements."
"I am recommending in this budget the last $40 million installment of our landmark Open Lands Trust initiative, which already has preserved more land for open space and public use than at any point in state history."
"To date, more than 40,000 acres have been purchased by the OLT program and in cooperation with other programs we have created our largest state park in Southern Illinois and built more than 500 miles of new biking and hiking trails in all parts of the state."
"This budget includes more than $30 million to keep our commitment to the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program and Conservation 2000, programs that are protecting tons of valuable topsoil."
"And this budget will continue to fund our new AgriFIRST program, a multi-year effort to help family farmers and other agricultural businesses add value to their crops."
"This budget will help support tourism throughout Illinois, an industry that creates more than 300,000 jobs and $24 billion in economic activity."
"Our tourism program, the largest by any state in the nation, will benefit this year from the completion of new improvements at many of our state parks and recreation areas, as well as the completion of the library portion of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum just a few blocks from here."
"I hope you will join me in a few months for the groundbreaking of the museum portion of the complex, as well as the opening of the library this fall."
This budget includes $3 million for the first-year operation of the center.
"And, as we enter 2002, this budget recommends that the state continue to move forward with Illinois FIRST and the VentureTECH programs."
"For the fourth year in a row, Illinois FIRST will enable the Department of Transportation to fund a highway construction program worth more than $2 billion – a record for sustained road repair and building initiative that is the envy of other states."
And Illinois FIRST includes funds to continue the repair and upgrading of mass transit system in all parts of Illinois.
"By now, I think my views on the importance of Illinois FIRST are quite clear."
"It’s a good program, and despite all of the distortions and finger pointing, is a program that has been embraced throughout the state."
"When it’s through, we’ll have pumped $7 billion into the pockets of working men and women in every part of this state."
"If that’s not an economic stimulus package, I don’t know what is."
Illinois FIRST has been a benefit to every region of Illinois and that’s something that no one can deny.
"To my amazement and to my utter surprise, even some of Illinois FIRST’s harshest critics have gladly accepted funds for projects for their districts."
The same can be said for VentureTECH.
We have used the $2 billion program to boost and build one of the nation’s leading high-tech economies.
"With VentureTECH, we will be leveraging some $4 billion in private and federal government investment in new products, buildings and systems."
"In this budget, we will earmark funds for a new post-genomics institute at the University of Illinois, a new chemical sciences building at the U of I’s Chicago campus, a cancer research center at Southern Illinois University here in Springfield and a new facility for the treatment of juvenile diabetes at the University of Chicago."
We’re also going to continue our support for a new biomedical research building and a nanotechnology center for Northwestern University.
Our commitment to building a technology infrastructure for the 21st century is going to pay tremendous dividends in the future.
"Right now, scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory in the Chicago suburbs are trying to land a massive new research project called the Rare Isotope Accelerator, a project that will advance physics and nuclear astrophysics to the next level of understanding."
The federal government has committed $1 billion to the development of this project.
The operating budget would be almost $100 million per year and the facility would employ some 400 highly skilled engineers and scientists.
I call on members of the Illinois Congressional delegation to join with me to bring this new scientific tool to Illinois.
"With Argonne and FermiLab already at our disposal, and with the infrastructure improvements in Illinois born through VentureTECH, no other state can boast a better environment for this project."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the FY 2003 budget I lay before you today is balanced and I believe it is fair."
"It is less than I would have wanted, but it is all we can afford."
I understand that it is not without pain.
I’ve told you my priorities and I‘ve identified the budget reallocations to pay for them.
"You may have other, different priorities.If so, let’s discuss them."
"But remember, at the end of the day, the budget must be balanced."
We cannot spend more than our revenues will allow.
"If you don’t like my suggested reductions in spending, tell me your alternatives."
I believe we can fashion compromises that serve the common good.
But we must have the resolve to do so.
"I have one more challenge for you as elected officials, and as public servants."
There’s one more person in the gallery I’d like you to meet.
"Little Isabella Irwin is here with us today, along with her mother, Peggy and her father, Jeff.Peggy works in my office."
Isabella was born in January – just last month.
"She represents all of the children that will be affected by the decisions we make this year, and the decisions that you – and our successors – make in the years to come."
My final challenge to you is to make sure that the life that Isabella has in Illinois is better than the lives of the children that came before her.
"We, as public servants, have the power and the obligation to help make the lives of all children as perfect as we possibly can."
"We have an obligation and a responsibility to that little girl, and to all the children of Illinois."
Our actions help determine their futures.
And that’s a challenge that we should always embrace.
"As Lincoln said, “the occasion is piled high with difficulty."
"But in the same breath, he also said: “We must rise to the occasion.We will rise to the occasion.There’s no doubt in my mind."
The future of this state is bright.
We are strong and we are confident in our capabilities.
"And as Pogo once said, “we are confronted with insurmountable opportunities."
Let’s work together to take full advantage of those opportunities.Thank you.
God bless you and God Bless the people of the State of Illinois.
