SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of the 43rd Legislature, distinguished guests, fellow New Mexicans: Welcome to the 1997 state of the state address -- and a special welcome to all of our new legislators."
Let me get right to the point so that all of us can get right down to business.
"The state of our state is ""a state of greatness"" -- A state of great people -- A state with great resources -- And a state with great potential As we near the next century, I can tell you as your Governor, New Mexico is a great state with a great future."
"But, as your Governor, I must also report that New Mexico is faced with equally great challenges."
-- The challenge of violent crime which is again among the worst in the nation .
". . and getting worse, not better."
"-- The challenge of promoting stronger economic growth in a state where our people have one of the lowest levels of per capita income, and yet they have to shoulder one of the nation's HIGHEST levels of per capita taxation."
-- The challenge of rebuilding our system of education today so that all New Mexicans are better prepared for the global competition of tomorrow.
"I'm making these challenges because across the country, New Mexico is recognized as a great place to live -- therefore, we need to seek constant improvement and not lose the gains we have been making."
"And we, gathered here for the 43rd Legislature, face a special and personal challenge -- the challenge of leadership, the challenge of facing hard truths and making tough choices."
-- Tough choices that will send a clear signal to all citizens that government can do what needs to be done -- without raising taxes.
-- Tough choices that will start the construction of prisons over the next few months.
-- And tough choices that will end welfare as we know it and bring better and more affordable health care to citizens in need.
"To guide the 43rd Legislature in making these tough choices, I offer both a plan and a budget: -- A plan that will tell all welfare recipients, ""If you can work, you will work."
"-- A plan that will tell violent criminals of all ages, ""If you commit the crime, you will do the time."
"-- A plan that will tell our Native American citizens, ""Your sovereignty is recognized and your jobs are vital."
"And I am submitting a budget -- -- A budget that tells all taxpayers in New Mexico what President Clinton told the nation just one year ago, ""The era of big government is over"" ."
. . and it's over in New Mexico!!
"-- A budget that tells all students and parents of students that ""Education is our best dollar spent."
-- A budget that tells all businessmen and businesswomen that government can do more with less.
A budget that delivers a government that puts people before politics.
I now refer you to the details of our administration's plan and budget that I am submitting to this 43rd Legislature.
"I call this plan the ""Seven Summits"" -- referring to my seven policy initiatives, major reforms and new directions that will take New Mexico into the next American century."
The seven summits describe A plan for meeting the many challenges that lie just ahead of us -- on our path to becoming a state of greatness.
SUMMIT #1 Fighting and Dramatically Reducing Violent Crime.
This is the people's top priority and it must be our top priority.
"While President Clinton and the Congress -- and many other states -- have committed to aggressive prison construction projects, New Mexico has lagged."
Crime needs to be fought on multiple levels -- with one of the most critical being adequate prison space.
"The fact that the Legislature in just the last five years has appropriated -- and governors have approved -- over 1 billion dollars for capital improvement projects, but has failed to build enough prison cells, symbolizes a lack of commitment to fighting violent crime."
We have adequate numbers of judges.
We have adequate numbers of criminal laws.
We have adequate numbers of police.
What we don't have enough of is prison capacity.
"Today -- right now -- we are short more than 1,000 prison beds."
"Two years ago, the Legislature gave me the legal authority to build two new prisons."
"Less than 90 days ago, after months of negotiations, Democratic legislative leaders signed an agreement to build those two new prisons."
"All of our administration's attempts to implement these laws and agreements have been met with resistance, delays and litigation."
Less than 24 hours ago I met with my key cabinet secretaries to discuss the very dangerous overcrowding that exists in our prisons and juvenile facilities.
"For the third straight year -- I challenge this Legislature to do just one thing to fight violent crime in New Mexico: ""Build Prisons!"""
And only one action must be taken by this Legislature for those prisons to become a reality: adopt a prison financing package without raising taxes.
"I trust this 43rd Legislature will act decisively to provide the prisons to incarcerate and punish those who commit crimes in New Mexico so that we can again turn more of our attention to crime prevention, law enforcement and reduction of drug use."
SUMMIT #2 is the Public Mandate to Reform Our Welfare System.
"Welfare, as we know it today, is badly flawed.It does not work."
And it's far too expensive to run.
"Finally, it's unfair -- to both the taxpayer and the welfare recipient."
Welfare must be reformed and my administration has a plan to do just that.
"Starting this July first , welfare -- as we have come to know it in New Mexico -- will end."
"In its place will be an initiative called ""Work First."
Gone is the lifetime entitlement to cash assistance.
Gone are most of the federal mandates.
Gone are the disincentives to marriage and the incentives to illegitimacy.
"In its place is our Work First initiative that sends one very clear signal from start to finish and from top to bottom: ""If you can work, you will work."
"Under Work First, over 5,000 welfare recipients will go to work in the first 12 months of the program."
And thousands more will go to work each and every year thereafter.
"Taxpayers will save money, families will be kept intact and a generation of children will be saved from a failed system."
I challenge all New Mexicans to join us in making Work First a reality and a success.
"Under Work First, we will offer a helping hand up, not a government hand-out!"
A helping hand up with day care for young children; a helping hand up with job training and job searches; and a helping hand up with vocational education.
"Under Work First, there will be an all-out effort to crack down on deadbeat dads."
"If you owe child support in New Mexico, you'll pay -- and you'll pay every month until that child reaches age 18."
And I can report that many of these reforms are already being field tested all across New Mexico in advance of the July first roll-out.
"We can make welfare reform a reality within months, if the 43rd Legislature will: -- Hold hearings on our Work First welfare reform plan and provide comment."
"-- Enact several ""get tough"" child support enforcement laws."
"-- Abolish the old labor department and create a new ""workforce development"" department to administer welfare reform."
-- Enact a department budget that makes the Work First initiative a reality this July first.
"If the 1997 Legislature takes these four actions, we will have delivered on President Clinton's promise to ""."
". . end welfare as we know it. . . . And we will have delivered on our promise to provide the opportunity to over 25,000 citizens on welfare to once again be self-sufficient."
SUMMIT #3 of the Johnson Administration is Better and More Efficient Health Care for the Poor.
"We call our initiative, ""¡SALÚD!"""
"which throughout New Mexico means ""To Your Health!""¡Salúd!"
because it will actually improve health care for almost a quarter of a million citizens .¡Salúd!
because it will save tens of millions of taxpayer dollars each and every year.¡Salúd!
"because we can finally bring under control a federally mandated program -- Medicaid -- which has ""broken budgets"" for over 10 years in New Mexico."
"Like welfare, we must put an end to ""Medicaid as we have known it."
"While most of the country, including the private sector, has moved to managed care, New Mexico is still operating under an expensive fee-for-service program."
"This year alone, Medicaid will cost New Mexico taxpayers 65 million dollars more than was budgeted if we continue with fee for service."
That's money that could have been put into public school classrooms.
Our administration's plan will use managed health care to control costs.
Our administration's plan will crack down on fraud and abuse -- and use quality control to make every dollar count.
Our administration's plan will reorganize the existing Department of Health to focus on preventive health care; it will consolidate all of the state's health functions under one roof; and it will maximize the privatization of existing public health care facilities.
Next week our administration will take the final step in making ¡Salúd!a reality.
"With federal approval, over the next few months, Medicaid managed care will become a reality in New Mexico."
"With review by the 43rd Legislature of our managed care proposal and approval of a newly reorganized Department of Health, New Mexico will join more than 30 other states that have revolutionized their Medicaid and public health care systems."
"I challenge this Legislature to support the reform of Medicaid today, to embrace managed care and to free up millions of tax dollars for investments we need to make in our schools."
SUMMIT #4 is the Successful Resolution of Indian Gaming.
"In all of my dealings with the Indian tribes, pueblos and nations of New Mexico, I have committed to practicing the principles of mutual respect and self determination."
"And as Governor, I have committed the state of New Mexico to the official recognition of the doctrine of Indian Sovereignty."
I honor that commitment today and I will honor that commitment tomorrow.
Just like two years ago -- when in good faith I signed Indian gaming compacts -- I remain committed to the sovereignty of all Indian citizens and their economic independence.
And I remain committed to the adoption of valid Indian gaming compacts.
"I propose the following specific actions by the 43rd Legislature -- -- Provide for non-Indian gaming by fraternal organizations, charitable organizations and racetracks on a very limited basis."
"-- Provide a legal basis for negotiating, signing and regulating Indian gaming compacts under federal law."
-- Provide for revenue sharing between the gaming tribes and pueblos and the state.
I have legislation that will do what I just described.
This legislation will provide the state with millions of dollars of new revenue each year that we can invest in our schools and the future of our children.I support Indian Sovereignty.
I support the right to Indian economic self determination.
And I support the Indian gaming legislation you will have before you.
SUMMIT #5 is A Government that Delivers the Best Services at the Lowest Possible Cost.
"For too many years, New Mexico taxpayers got a government that grew larger and cost more."
"In 1997, we start our third year on a glide path of smaller budgets, smaller bureaucracy and yet greater efficiency."
"With this plan and budget, taxpayers should know that the long reign of autopilot spending by state government is over."
"The era of a government that only knew how to add, but not subtract, is done."
"In 1997, citizens can be assured that government can work better, at less cost and that it can make tough decisions."
"With this budget New Mexico taxpayers will have a judicial system statewide that works well, enforces our laws and defends our freedoms."
With this budget our taxpayers will provide a public school opportunity for each and every New Mexico child and the opportunity of a college education at tuition rates among the very lowest in the United States -- and at colleges located in almost every major population center in our state.
"With this budget over 25,000 New Mexicans on welfare will have the real opportunity to get a job, support their families and be self-sufficient."
With this budget tens of thousands of New Mexicans on Medicaid will move to a better system -- a managed health care system -- one that provides better health care and a system that will save taxpayers money.
And with this budget we will not have to burden taxpayers with higher taxes.
"We will deliver on our promise to live within our means -- and we will deliver on our promise ""To provide the best government services at the lowest possible cost."
SUMMIT #6 is Supporting Long-Term Economic Growth in New Mexico Through Road Construction and Tax Cuts.
"In addition to great schools and an entrepreneurial people, there are two other cornerstones to fundamental economic growth: essential public infrastructure and lower taxes."
A basic function of government is to provide essential public infrastructure that directly supports strong population growth and powerful economic growth.
Our priorities involve making tough choices.
"It is my choice -- and my recommendation to this Legislature -- that 1997 be the year we start to build two major four-lane roads in New Mexico: ""four-laning"" Highway 285 from Clines Corners to Carlsbad and ""four-laning"" Highway 44 from Farmington to Albuquerque."
"These two roads will support millions of dollars of new business and industry, create thousands of new jobs and promote economic growth in rural areas of the state that all too often are forgotten."
The financing for Highway 44 will come from redirecting road fund money from its current expenditure on the operation of government to its proper expenditure on the construction of highways.
The funding for Highway 285 is taken care of through the issuance of bonds secured by Congressional commitments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Project.
Completion of these two road projects symbolizes both New Mexico's economic progress and the commitment of this administration to four-lane highways connecting our centers of commerce and our people.
The other cornerstone of growth is lower taxes.
"Again, I will state my position on taxes and then my plan for the 1997 legislative session: First."
The 3 billion dollars of general fund money appropriated over the next 60 days is not really government's money; it belongs to the people and they should keep as much of it as possible.
Equally important -- it is my belief that 3 billion dollars is enough to run our state government -- more than enough.Second.
New Mexico taxes are far too high.
"In 1996, average New Mexico workers labored until May 12 just to pay their state, federal and local taxes."
"In 1996, average New Mexicans worked more each day to pay their taxes than they did to pay for food, housing and clothing combined!Third.Taxes make you poorer."
"As a result, citizens need to work harder and longer."
That's not right and that's not fair.Fourth.
Taxes reduce the reward to work.
"That's not right, nor is it fair.Fifth and finally."
"As a U. S. Supreme Court justice said 187 years ago, ""The power to tax involves the power to destroy."
Those are my beliefs about taxes.Now for my 1997 tax plan.First.
Tax cuts are the best step we can take toward economic growth.
Personal income goes up as taxes come down.
Job growth goes up as taxes come down.Second.Tax reform means tax cuts.Reform means reduce.
"Accordingly, I am proposing a modest tax cut of 15 million dollars."
"While modest in size, this cut is real, it is right and it will mean the third straight year of tax reductions for our citizens.Third and finally."
Tax hikes of any kind are not acceptable.
"SUMMIT #7 the FINAL and MOST IMPORTANT SUMMIT is -- Public Schools that are Strictly Accountable, Continuously Improving and Adequately Funded."
"The new ""Equation for Education"" is: Strict Accountability plus Continuous Improvement plus Adequate Funding Equals the Best Schools and the Brightest Students."
"Accountability goes to the heart of our problems in public education: -- Accountability of students to prove, through rigorous annual testing, that they deserve to advance academically."
-- Accountability of schools to make sure students have mastered the basics and that schools are safe and orderly.
-- Accountability of the State Board of Education and the State Department of Public Education to ensure that our academic standards are high and that they are enforced.
"Ironically, there is one person in New Mexico who is not held accountable, and should be, for what happens in our schools -- and that person is me -- the Governor of New Mexico.I want that responsibility.I want to be held accountable."
"The 1995 Constitutional Revision Commission concluded: ""."
. . the Governor should have more direct control over the setting of educational policy and the expenditure of those funds to carry out that policy. . . .
"I'm asking this Legislature, via an amendment to the Constitution, to let the voters decide whether they want to make the Governor of their state responsible and accountable for public education by giving him or her direct control."
I'm asking this Legislature to let the voters decide whether to take the bold action of eliminating the State Board of Education and the position of superintendent of public instruction.
"In their place, the voters would create a ""secretary of education"" to be appointed by the Governor."
The State Department of Public Education would be under direct executive control like any other department of government.
"These are essential first steps in accountability -- accountability at the very top, in the office of the Governor and with a secretary of education -- rather than with a state school board responsible for everything and accountable for nothing."
Accountability is only the first part of the new Equation for Education.
The second part is continuous improvement: -- Continuous improvement through our use of technology and distance learning.
-- Continuous improvement through the rigorous academic testing of every student in every grade at every school every year.
-- Continuous improvement through adoption of the clearest and the highest of standards for our teachers and for our colleges of education.
Continuous improvement means constant progress toward our goal of truly having the best school system in America.
"But to make that continuous improvement, we need a plan."
A strategic plan that will take us from where we are now to where we want to be.
"In 1996, we took a giant step toward the development of that strategic plan for our schools."
We enacted a law: the Strategic Planning for Public Education Act.
"We appropriated $100,000 to develop a strategic plan for our schools."
We appointed 30 distinguished New Mexicans to a task force to write that plan.
And we now have the first draft plan ready for review by all New Mexicans.
The recommendations of that task force deserve our attention.
By getting behind one plan -- a long-range strategic plan -- we can get from here to there.
We can have the best schools and the brightest students in America.
The third and final piece of the new Equation for Education is adequate funding for our schools.
Accountability and continuous improvement must be joined by sufficient sums of money if we are to really have the best schools and the brightest students.
"As a state, as a people and as elected officials, we need to have an honest discussion and then a firm and long-term commitment to ""paying for a first rate school system."
Adequate funding for education never seems to be adequate.
"Too many times schools are not built, teachers do not get raises and students do not get computers."
Too many times school districts are forced to get by because superintendents lack funds to make improvements and principals cannot reward those who excel.
"Today, I am proposing a plan -- guaranteed by an amendment to the state constitution that will forever provide adequate funding to New Mexico's schools."
"I call it the ""50 in 5 School Plan."
It will allow voters the chance to amend the Constitution to guarantee our schools will receive at least 50% of the state general fund budget within five years.
It will take our present spending from 45% to 50%.
"If the voters approve this constitutional amendment, it will provide adequate funding to our schools."
It would mean 130 million dollars more in funding if this were in place today.
I am proposing that this be implemented over a period of five years to make it realistic and achievable.
-- It will increase school spending by hundreds of millions of dollars.
"-- It will put education at the front of the budget line, not at the rear of the line."
-- It will put computers in every school.
-- It will provide school districts with the resources to pay our school teachers the salaries they will earn based on merit.
-- It will tie this permanent increase in school funding to a permanent increase school performance and in continuous student improvement.
"-- It will tell every parent, every student and everyone in business and industry that the Governor and the Legislature truly believe that education is our best dollar spent, not our last dollar spent!"
The legislation to take this proposed constitutional amendment to the people for a vote is my seventh and final summit.
I will commit the savings and the new revenue from the first six summit initiatives to our schools if this legislature will join me in reaching those six summits and in guaranteeing our schools will be fully accountable and continuously improving.
"Those are my Seven Summits -- my seven policy reforms and budget initiatives -- for consideration and action by this 43rd Legislature: -- Prison Financing -- Welfare Reform -- Improved Health Care -- Indian Gaming -- A Smaller and Better Government -- A Stronger Economy -- Better Schools This is my administration's agenda -- I believe, the people's agenda -- and I hope the agenda of this 43rd Legislature."
I will work hard with this Legislature to reach these seven summits -- to make these policy and budget initiatives a reality.
I will focus on achieving real and tangible results.
I will listen to the leadership on both sides of the aisle for solutions that make sense.
"And finally -- while spending most of my time in Santa Fe for the legislative session -- I want all New Mexicans to know that I will be traveling throughout the state in an effort to speak with as many citizens and taxpayers as possible about this agenda, about these priorities, about these reforms."
"Our citizens are tired of listening to leaders who say, ""Let's move slowly"" when they know other states are moving at light speed toward the future."
Our citizens are tired of being last when they want and deserve to be first.
Our citizens are tired of business as usual and politics of the past.
They are telling us to put people before politics.
"I am calling upon all New Mexicans in all regions of our state, in all walks of life, at all levels of government and of all political parties to join with me -- and with this 43rd Legislature to take the next step on our path to building a stronger economy; on our path to having the best schools and the brightest students; on our path toward a ""state of greatness."
The Seven Summits are the first steps along this path.
"To every citizen listening today I ask, ""Will you help us reach these Seven Summits?"""
Will you help us -- Build prisons to fight violent crime?
-- Reform welfare to put people to work?
-- Improve our health care system and save millions of dollars?
-- Resolve Indian gaming to save jobs and promote economic growth among Indians?
-- Deliver the best government services at the lowest possible cost?
-- Build a stronger economy through road construction and lower taxes?
"Will you help us -- Create better schools so that they are fully accountable, continuously improving and adequately funded?"
"Working together, walking one path, we will reach these summits on our way toward a state of greatness."
Thank you -- and may God bless New Mexico.
