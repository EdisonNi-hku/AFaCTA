SENTENCES
"In this Easter season, we celebrate resurrection and rebirth."
"As we begin the season of Spring, we also celebrate renewal and the opportunity to begin again."
The people of our state deserve no less.It is to this end.
"rebirth, renewal, and the opportunity to begin again."
that this session is dedicated.
"It is my mission, and I hope it is your mission."
"It is my mission, because Louisiana has experienced failure, decay and the loss of opportunity too often.for too many years.for too many generations."
This session is dedicated to continuing the effort to change the priorities of our state.
to place our scarce resources on those matters that matter the most to our people.to their families.and to our common future.
"When it is time for change, there will always be disagreements."
"When it is time for rearranging priorities, there will always be differences of opinions."
"As long as the disagreements are in good faith, I respect these differences."
"However, we must share a common mission."
"we must change our state, and we must give our people the opportunity to begin again.Differences of opinions.yes.politics.no!"
"A year and a half ago, we began to see the stirrings of Spring for our state."
"We made a start, but, now, as farmers like to say, Spring is really upon us."
"In the past year and a half, we leveled the legal playing field, and, now, this is a place where business wants to come and wants to stay."
"In fact, look around, businesses are investing in our state like few times in its history.good jobs are being created."
and opportunities now exist where only unemployment and despair once lived.
We promised the people an opportunity to vote on gambling in their communities and we made good on that promise.
We have balanced the budget without gimmicks or tax increases for the first time since 1983. a decade and a half ago.
We have actually reduced the budget.in real dollars.
and the number of state employees for the first time in years.
We intend to propose a budget that will be three hundred million dollars less than last year's if we maintain our present tax structure.We have kept the faith.
we have used nonrecurring revenues for nonrecurring expenses.
We have made a wise investment in our college faculty by bringing their salaries up to the southern regional average.
"We have invested cash in infrastructure, roads, long deferred maintenance, and parks."
"Now, in this Spring, our parks are no longer last in the nation in terms of per capita spending."
"As a simple contractor on Main Street, I have never given too much value to the words of Wall Street."
"However, they are the ones who are in the position of giving us a report card."
The bonding agencies have recognized our sound financial management and have given us a better bond rating for the first time in many years.
"While we can take pride in this, we can do better."
"We will do better, and we will start by beginning to establish a Rainy Day Fund for our state."
We retired the debt of the Louisiana Recovery District two years early.
We have fully funded our coastal restoration management for the first time in years.
an effort that in years to come will insure that our children and grandchildren can enjoy a beautiful Spring in our marshes.
"Yes, the winter of failure and decay is over.We have made the start."
"Now, like farmers all over our state, we must plow anew our fields, sow our seeds, tend our crops, and pray that the Almighty will bless us with good fortune."
"You have done your jobs, but, unfortunately, our job is greater, because our state must play catch-up for the years it suffered from the misplaced priorities of a wintry hayride."
"If we are to catch-up, we must all do better."
"If we are to catch-up, our decisions must be good faith decisions, not self-serving ones."
"In this Spring and this session, there is much that needs doing that will renew our state."
Let us begin this effort with our future.
It is long past time to make a frank admission.
we have not invested properly in our K-12 education system.
to make that investment and that commitment without wavering.
Let us also be honest that money will not fix education in Louisiana.
"However, if Louisiana insists on substandard funding, it is a certainty that we will continue to have a substandard product."
"This I will not tolerate, and this our people can no longer accept.My commitment is total."
"Working with our educators, teachers, parents, and students, I will do all I can do to fund our educational system and to institute programs, ideas, and concepts that will make the Louisiana educational system second to none."
"I will not be afraid to try new ideas and innovation, and those in the educational system should have no fear of these ideas either.Our children are long overdue.Let's simply do it!"
"While we made a start by raising the salaries of our faculties, higher education in Louisiana has been managed by too many boards, too much politics, and too little coordination."
"Through the years, many of us have tried to remedy this situation."
"We failed, and the problems persisted."
"When we need changes in higher education to meet the demands of a global economy, we do not need to talk to four management boards.We need to meet the demands."
"To this end, I will propose consolidating the decision making of major issues of higher education in such areas as capitol improvements, budgeting, and program distribution in one higher education governing board while leaving the day to day operations to the existing boards."
"In this way, the Legislature and the Executive Branch can move forward in the most direct manner on matters affecting the higher education of our people."
We have to accept the fact that the Federal Government will not continue to bail us out of our Medicaid problems.
"We need an honest, effective system in place this year and into the future where Louisiana carries it's own load like the rest of the United States with a system that is compassionate, honest and fair."
"When the Congress made the tough decision to reform the welfare system of our nation, many of us simply said that ""it's about time."
"Now, with the responsibility returned to our states, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing the tools so our citizens who want to work can have a job or have the opportunity to train for a job."
I will propose a workforce development policy that will do just this.
It is a policy that takes the money out of bureaucracy and puts our money on training people to meet the real job opportunities and demands of the market place.
It is time that people go to work at a job rather than spending their time working the system.It is long overdue.Let us admit it!
"For those who are truly needy, there must be a safety net, but it must be a net, not a hammock."
"In health care, this means we must have a program that emphasizes primary care over emergency care."
This also means that our scarce health care dollars must get to the recipients and not to those who commit fraud to become rich at the expense of the poor.
"In order to insure that place of primary care, I will propose placing the governance of our charity hospital system with the LSU medical system and the medical schools of our state."
The ethics and the goals of the medical schools and LSU parallel that of a healthy charity hospital system.
"When it comes to health in our state, we must admit that the problem of drugs and drug abuse has had a profound impact on many lives."
"In the area of crime, this insidious monster has had a direct impact on lives being destroyed and prisons being filled."
Every statistic indicates a lack of progress in dealing with drugs and drug abuse.
Interdiction of supply has not worked.
Law enforcement will admit that drugs cannot be stopped at its sources in an effective manner.
"However, we do know what works and has worked."
Drugs are not the problem they once were in the business world and some government agencies.Drug testing has stopped it.
"When there is a price to pay and a check to lose, people find a way to quit a bad habit very quickly."
"We owe it to the people of Louisiana to make an effort to make certain that anybody who draws a check from government, whether they be on public assistance, in the legislature, the executive branch, mayor, school board, police jury, or contractors working for the state, are drug free.We have the ability.Do we have the will?It is up to you."
"We propose a constitutional amendment to guarantee victims of crime, fair and compassionate treatment in our legal system."
"Finally, with much effort, I believe we have found agreement between victims groups and law enforcement."
"On another subject, everybody I know."
everybody I meet all over the state.tells me one thing.
They are sick and tired of paying the auto insurance rates we are paying.Let us frankly admit.it is time to do something.
and that something is to lower these insurance rates.
"For me, a law and a prayer will not be sufficient."
I want auto insurance rates reduced.
"I want no excuses, no gimmicks, and no games."
"More importantly, check with your constituents, they want none of this either."
"they want lower auto insurance rates, and they want them now!"
"In conclusion, the only rebirth.the only resurrection."
that really matters to each of us does not come from government.It comes from God.
"However, we have an obligation of stewardship."
To leave our world better than we found it.
"To give our children and grandchildren a better place to live and an opportunity to achieve that which talent, hard work, and God's blessings will give them."
My vision for Louisiana is based on this obligation of stewardship.
I want Louisiana to be a state where our children are educated so that they will be able to compete against workers in Japan and China.
"I want our workforce trained, and our people working."
"I want our families together, our people healthy, our environment clean, and jobs available."
"I want our communities safe from crime and drugs so people can live in them, our roads safe so our people can drive on them, and our financial footing sound so our people can depend on it."
"In short, I want Louisiana to be a state that you, I, and our citizens can be proud to say its home.This is our Spring.Let's not waste it."
Let us pray that Almighty God will bless our efforts.and God Bless you.
God bless the great state of Louisiana.
and God bless the United States of America.Thank you.
