SENTENCES
"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, distinguishedstate officials, members of the 88th General Assembly and citizensof the State of Missouri."
I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you aboutMissouri's future and to present to you my Fiscal Year 1996 budgetproposal.
This budget is designed to help prepare Missouri for the challengesof the 21st century.
And it is designed to help meet the toughchallenges facing Missouri right now.
This budget includes no tax increases and it contains a proposalto require that all major tax increases be submitted to a voteof the people.
"This budget cuts obsolete spending, and it focuses on waysto make government more efficient and less wasteful."
This budget redirects existing resources and changes the waywe do business to more effectively address the health and safetyneeds of Missouri's most vulnerable and valuable citizens .its children.
"And it continues to enhance our investments inour schools, our colleges, and our universities."
This budget offers some tax relief to self-employed Missouriansand to families who care for elderly parents.
"And perhaps most importantly, this budget -- once again --steps up our fight against crime."
Nothing shakes the foundation of a community more than violentcrime.
"I don't care how long it takes, I don't care how hard it is,and I don't care who's going to get in our way ."
We are notgoing to let the thugs and the pushers take over our neighborhoodsand take over our schools.
"In a few moments, I will offer my proposal for taking the nextstep in our war against crime."
"But first, I want to start withsome of the good things that are happening in Missouri ."
someof the things we can be proud of and that are making Missourian outstanding place to live and raise a family.
"I am pleased to report that after years of decline, Missouri'seconomy is moving again, both in our cities and in our rural areas."
Unemployment in the state has dropped to 3.9% -- the lowestlevel in over 16 years.
And more Missourians than ever beforeare employed in full-time jobs.
"In fact, we have even reversed the long-standing declinein our state's manufacturing sector, with a net increase of over10,000 new manufacturing jobs coming on line since the beginningof 1993."
"For years we've been talking about the need for Missouri tobe able to compete globally, in markets all around the world.Well .we're doing it."
Missouri's agricultural and manufacturing exports are booming.
"In the last two years, Missouri's exports to overseas marketshave increased not by tens of millions of dollars, but by hundredsof millions of dollars."
"The fact is that when businesses take a close look at Missouri'sbusiness climate, they like what they see."
"In just the past twoyears alone, the Missouri Department of Economic Development hashelped 170 out-of-state companies launch new operationshere in Missouri."
And it has helped 180 Missouri-basedcompanies initiate major expansions right here at home.
"And you'll recognize some of the names: Chrysler in Fenton, Ford Motor Company in Hazelwood, Gateway 2000 Computers in Kansas City, Huffy Bicycle in Farmington, Redwing Shoe in Potosi, Wire Rope in Chillicothe These are just some of the recently announced business expansionsand relocations that are creating new jobs for Missouri and helpingour economy grow."
"And I'm pleased to note another recently-announced major businessrelocation to Missouri: It's a tough, lean, competitive operationthat used to be known as the Los Angeles Rams."
Now they'll be known as the St. Louis Rams.
And they'll give St. Louis football fans the NFL team they'vebeen waiting for.
Missouri's economy is on the move.
And it's because Missourihas become a good place to do business.
"Our strong commitment to education and training, our high qualitywork force, our highly diversified economy, our quality roadsand infrastructure, and a combined state and local tax burdenthat's among the lowest in the nation are just a few of the reasonsthat Missouri is, today, experiencing an economic renaissance."
"Before I leave this subject, I want to recognize the outstandingwork of the Missouri Business Council and the Missouri Departmentof Economic Development."
From their efforts have come Missouri's first strategic economicdevelopment plan to expand our economy and create new jobs.
"This new, first-ever plan has helped this state focus its economicdevelopment efforts on those things that are really important."
"like finance, job training, access to technology and technologyinfrastructure."
These efforts are paying off now.
"They will continue to payoff for decades to come in new jobs, new businesses, and new markets."
"Let there be no doubt -- this administration is committed togood-paying private sector jobs for Missourians, strong growthfor Missouri businesses, and expanding markets for Missouri products."
I've already mentioned some of the things we are doing to meetthese objectives; let me tell you more.
A well-educated work force is the most precious economic resourcewe have.
"Without a highly-skilled and educated work force, highwage employers will not stay in Missouri and we will not be ableto compete for the high-skill, high-wage jobs that are so importantto our future."
"Two years ago, we passed a major education reform bill to improveprimary and secondary education here in Missouri."
This new law-- called the Outstanding Schools Act -- is helping prepare ourfuture work force for the demands of the global economy.
"Already because of this law: class sizes are smaller, more children have access to computers and new technologies, early childhood education in Missouri has improved and expanded, and children who would have otherwise dropped out of schoolare staying in school and are getting the education or trainingthey need to hold good jobs and help employers compete for business."
"And under the Outstanding Schools Act, teachers and administratorsare held accountable for results."
Every parent and taxpayer willhave access to information about how well each school is doingin educating its students.
"I am pleased to report, that under the budget I am introducingtoday, the state is right on target in fully funding the OutstandingSchools Act -- providing schools the resources they need to giveour children a quality education."
"This year, I am also proposing to improve education and trainingat the university, college and community college levels by investingin crucial areas that will pay dividends not only for our campusesand students, but for our businesses and economy as well."
"For example, I am proposing funds for desperately needed newequipment in our science and engineering labs, and for new computersand modems that will give our students, faculty and researchersaccess to libraries and other important resources that are nowbeyond their reach."
"Furthermore, over the years, the physical facilities on someof our campuses have become inadequate or have deteriorated beyondacceptable levels."
"Not only do inadequate and run-down facilities hinder academicachievement and job training, but they also make it much moredifficult for our colleges to attract high quality students, faculty,and private investment."
"Therefore, my budget includes one-time funds to help buildor renovate the libraries, science labs, medical facilities, andclassrooms our campuses need in order to train a high qualitywork force."
Good jobs are not something we can just sit idly by and waitfor; we've got to make them happen.
Self-employed entrepreneurs are a crucial segment of Missouri'seconomy.
Small businesses are responsible for about 80% of allthe new jobs created each year and most of those small businessesstarted off as self-employed individuals.
We must encourage potentialentrepreneurs in Missouri to take the risk of starting their ownbusinesses.
The federal government recently took a step backward that actuallydiscourages people from starting a business: Last yearCongress failed to renew the federal tax deduction for healthcare premiums for self-employed people.
"When that tax deduction expired, the cost of starting a businessas a self-employed person went up."
"That's not good for business,it's not good for job growth, and it's not good for our economy."
"Therefore, I propose the State of Missouri step in to restorepart of that tax deduction."
"Specifically, I propose that self-employedMissourians and their families be able to deduct 50% of theirhealth insurance costs."
This tax cut will enable them to recover about one-half ofthe impact of their lost federal deduction.
"By restoring partof that lost deduction and offering this modest assistance, wewill accomplish two things: We will help remove the high cost of health insurance as abarrier to self-employment; And we will give Missouri's self-employed individuals a competitiveedge over their counterparts in other states."
That makes good sense because it boosts our biggest sourceof new jobs -- Missouri's entrepreneurs.
"When we talk about preparing Missouri for the economic challengesof the 21st century, we must consider the crucial role of technologyand telecommunications."
Our competitive future depends uponour ability to keep pace with rapidly changing information technology.
We must be fully prepared to compete in the information age.
"That's why, right now, we're working on an ambitious three-yearproject to link every school district and public library in Missourito the information superhighway, so that our students, communitiesand small businesses can have access to information that is nowway beyond their reach."
"And as we learned from the recent findings of our Commissionon Informational Technology, we must change Missouri's regulatoryclimate so that we reward innovation and bring state-of-the-arttechnology to every community across the state."
We must levelthe playing field within the telecommunications industry to allowcompetition to drive technological innovation.
"I am convinced that, with these changes, we can transform afew isolated pilot projects into the best advanced statewide telecommunicationssystem in the country."
Another way state government can help facilitate economic growthis by keeping our own fiscal house in order.
FortunatelyMissouri continues to be one of the most fiscally responsiblestates in the nation.
We have a balanced budget every year.
"Not only is it requiredby our state constitution, but it enjoys wide bi-partisan support."
We continue to be one of only a handful of states that consistentlyreceives a Triple-A rating from all three financial rating agencies.We have very low debt.
And we have been able to maintain our position as one of thelowest tax states in the nation.
Forty-eight states have a highercombined state and local tax burden than does Missouri.
Missouri's solid financial condition is the result of thisstate's strong and long-standing tradition of fiscal responsibility.
a tradition that my administration is fully committed to.
"I'm proud of the fact that, in my first two years as Governor,we have worked together to cut $150 million dollars inobsolete programs and unnecessary spending, and moved that moneyto high priority areas such as education, job training and lawenforcement -- those things that make our economy grow, make ourprivate sector strong, and make our neighborhoods secure."
This year we continue that effort.
My budget for Fiscal Year'96 proposes another $50 million dollars in spending cuts we canmake by improving efficiency and terminating unnecessary spending.
These cuts will help make sure we have enough money to payfor those things that are really important.
"And they will helpus fulfill our responsibility to run state government wisely andefficiently.And of course, that's not all."
"Even as we speak, we are inthe process of conducting a massive review of operations throughoutstate government."
"We are consolidating services, streamlining processes, andre-thinking how government is run."
"This review, conducted through the new Commission on Managementand Productivity, also known as COMAP, is already leading to changesthat are improving the efficiency and productivity of state government."
"For example, as a result of COMAP's work, we've begun the processof consolidating state data centers, printing operations, andwarehouses."
This will save Missouri over $5 million dollars ayear.
And COMAP is helping us overhaul our state purchasing laws-- some of which were written over 50 years ago -- so that wecan save tax dollars through a more efficient and up-to-date purchasingsystem.
These changes -- and many others that have been identifiedthrough this on-going management review process -- are being implementednow.
"And they will help make government work harder, smarterand leaner."
"Let me take a moment to update you on another exciting initiativethat's already underway, and then tell you about a new idea I'mproposing this year."
"As many of you know, we are working on a major overhaul ofour Medicaid system to cut down on rising costs and make it workbetter."
"Medicaid costs are skyrocketing out of control, not justhere in Missouri, but in virtually every state in the country."
"But unlike most states, we're doing something about it."
We are asking the federal government for a waiver that willlet us get the federal bureaucracy out of our Medicaid programand let us implement our own system -- a system that will be somuch more cost-effective that we will be able to serve more people.at less cost than Medicaid .
without even having to cutbenefits.
That's really remarkable when you think about it .
. . if wecan get out from under these obsolete and overly-bureaucraticfederal regulations .
"we will be able to reduce the yearly increasesin Medicaid costs and, at the same time, get health insuranceto many people who do not now have it."
"Now, we will only be able to do this if the federal governmentapproves our waiver application, and if Congress does not shiftthe cost of more federal programs to the states.That second one is a big if ."
because Congress isthinking about shifting the cost of more federal programs to thestates.
"Until that issue is resolved, we will have to proceedcautiously and prudently."
"But if all goes well, this initiative will enable Missourito do more with less in the area of health care, and the startingplace will be with uninsured children who live in low-income families."
families with incomes below 200% of poverty.
"Approval of our waiver application will let us make healthinsurance available at no or low cost to these currently uninsuredchildren while, at the same time, saving Missouri taxpayers about$40 million dollars over the next five years.Pretty remarkable ."
"no tax increases, no mandates, no hugebureaucracy .just smarter government.How do we do it?"
": Acombination of managed care, better uses of existing state resources,and available federal funds."
Now let me tell you about another new initiative that we'reproposing this year.
"Again, this one is designed to help Missouri'schildren and their families in a more effective manner than everbefore."
"Missouri, like all other states, provides a wide array of humanservices to children and families in need."
"These services rangefrom health care to family counseling to alcohol and drug prevention,just to name a few."
But there's a basic problem that continuesto hinder the effective and efficient administration of services.
"The problem is that while it's people in Jefferson City whoare responsible for administering these services, it's the peoplein the communities across our state who really understand whatservices their communities need and how best to provide them."
"The fact is, we need more local involvement in human servicedelivery to children and families."
Each community has different needs and what they don'tneed is Jefferson City making all the decisions aboutwhat's best for our communities.
"When it comes to helping children,the cookie-cutter approach just doesn't work."
"Therefore, I am proposing that we move toward a system wherestate services to children and their families are planned andcoordinated by local community partnerships comprised of parents,school board members, business leaders, and representatives ofgovernment and not-for-profit agencies."
"These community partnerships will link local communities withstate and private resources, and develop school-linked local servicedelivery plans tailored to meet local needs."
"The result willbe more effective, more efficient, and more flexible service deliveryto children and families."
A clear example of where this school-linked approach is workingis Walbridge Caring Communities in St. Louis.
"This nationally-recognizedprogram has had proven success in helping young people succeedin school, stay healthy, and stay out of trouble."
The St. Louispolice even credit Walbridge Caring Communities for reducing crimein the neighborhood.
Walbridge may serve as a model for some other communities.
But the beauty of this plan is that it recognizes that everycommunity is different.
St. Louis is not Springfield and St. Joseph is not Cape Girardeau.
Each community will be able to tailor programs uniquely suitedto its own needs and challenges.
"What they will all have in common,however, is a strong commitment to helping children grow up healthy,safe, and prepared for the challenges of life."
I am recommending an investment of over $21 million dollarsfor this exciting new initiative in Fiscal Year '96.
This moneywill come from the redirection of existing state programs as wellas from additional federal funds.
No new state revenues willbe needed.
"Extensive budget reviews, COMAP, the Medicaid waiver and there-organization of children's services -- these are just someof the ways we are striving to improve efficiency, effectivenessand keep Missouri's fiscal house in order."
"But each year, this becomes harder and harder to do, becausethe federal government has a bad habit of starting new programsand then telling the states to pay for them."
These unfunded federal mandates place an almost unbearableburden on state resources.
"This year alone, Missouri has to come up with an additional$112 million dollars just to pay for one year's growth in unfundedfederal mandates."
Fully 25% of our state budget is consumed bythese required federal programs that we get the bill for.
I believe Congress should pass a federal balanced budget amendment.
"Unfortunately, one version of the balanced budget amendment thatCongress is considering will let Congress balance the federalbudget by making the states pay for more federal programs."
That's not balancing the budget; that's just sleight of hand.
"because, under that plan, Congress won't have to cut a dime'sworth of spending."
I -- and other governors -- are urging Congressnot to waste this opportunity.
Congress should pass a real balanced budget amendment thatforces them to make the cuts that are needed to actually bringthe federal budget into balance.
That means the federal balanced budget amendment must includelanguage that protects the states against unfunded federal mandates.
Congress should not waste this opportunity by just passinga public-relations gimmick that won't do anything but shift morefederal costs onto the states.
That's not responsible government.
And I ask the people of Missouri to join me in contacting ourfederal legislators to tell them that.
It is clear that the issue of tax limitation remains on theminds of voters.
Missourians feel they should have the right to vote on majortax increases.
The voters overwhelmingly defeated HancockII because it would have caused drastic cuts in many crucial servicesincluding education and law enforcement.
But they strongly support the idea that taxpayers should havesome direct influence over major tax decisions and a greater rolein the fiscal decisions of the state.
"Given the widespread sense of frustration and alienation peopleacross this nation have come to feel toward their political andsocial institutions, I think this is an understandable and reasonablerequest."
"And, clearly, this desire for more control is not unique toMissouri."
"In fact, Nevada and Florida approved tax limitationamendments in this past election, joining a growing number ofstates that have tax limitation measures on the books."
"If the debate over Hancock II demonstrated anything, it demonstratedthat the people of Missouri take the state's fiscal decisionsseriously."
"Clearly, the voters are willing to study the issuesand become informed, ignore the appeal of false promises, andmake prudent judgments about the future of Missouri."
"Last month, the Missouri Farm Bureau and I proposed a tax limitationamendment that will give Missouri voters the right to vote onall major tax increases."
"Our plan is clear and simple -- in fact, it is only four sentenceslong ."
"And it deals only with future tax increases, so,unlike Hancock II, it will not result in drastic cuts thatwill leave Missouri without the resources it needs to educateour children and protect our citizens."
"Furthermore, our plan includes enough flexibility to deal quicklywith natural disasters and other unforeseenemergencies."
We have great confidence that this proposed amendment willserve Missouri well.
It is a reasonable and responsible tax limitationproposal .
one that will give the people of Missouri the additionalcontrol they want over major tax increases.
Among those Missourians who need tax relief the most are familiescaring for elderly dependents.
"As life expectancies continueto increase, more and more Missouri families are being squeezedfinancially by the dual responsibilities of raising their childrenand helping their parents live their senior years with dignityand satisfaction."
To help these families -- and to help more Missouri seniorcitizens lead fulfilling and independent lives -- I propose thatwe increase the exemption for dependents over 65 years of agefrom $400 dollars to $2000 dollars.
"Because this is only a state tax deduction, it is only modestrelief."
But it's something we can do to lend a hand to some ofMissouri's senior citizens and their families.
"I'm also pleased to note that my budget provides some tax reliefto over 83,000 Missourians with disabilities."
This is the resultof a property tax relief bill that you passed and I signed lastyear.
That bill expands the circuit breaker for individuals withdisabilities and helps those with disabilities remain independentand in their own homes.
There is one more item I wish to discuss with you before weget to the issue of crime.
We rely on our state employees to provide crucial servicesto Missourians.
"I remain committed to attracting and retaininga dedicated, productive and experienced work force."
But we can only attract and retain quality employees if weoffer salaries that are competitive within the labor market.
"Salaries for many if not most state employees, however, continueto be far below the competitive marketplace."
"In fact, the pay for some full-time state employees is noteven sufficient to raise them above the federal poverty line."
"To help restore competitiveness and attract and retain qualityemployees, I am recommending a two percent cost-of-living increasefor state employees and modest within grade increases to rewardsuccess and experience."
"As a result, state employees will receivean average increase of about 3.8%."
Crime and particularly violent crime continue to plague ourstate and our nation.
We have a fundamental obligation to doall we can to protect the safety of our citizens.
"Last year, we passed one of the toughest sentencing laws inthe nation."
"It requires that dangerous, violent criminals serveno less than 85% of their sentences."
"In addition, judges, juriesand prosecutors are getting tougher on crime."
"As a result, violent criminals in Missouri are being lockedup for longer periods than ever before."
"Some people say that keeping dangerous criminals locked upfor a longer time isn't the answer.Well, let me tell you this."
"I think it's a good answer, because it will keep themaway from our children and our grandchildren."
Also last year we gave prosecutors tough new tools to makeit easier to convict child molesters and rapists.
But now it'stime for us to get to work again.
I am proposing a major prison construction program to makesure we have enough prison space to lock away violent criminalsfor as long as they need to be locked up.
"Under my proposal, we will add space for 6,500 new prisonersbeyond the increase in capacity that was provided for last year."
We can do this by using one-time revenues for construction ofa high security prison and for expansion of existing prisons .
and by using lease-purchase for construction of a maximum securityfacility.
This plan only makes room for the expected increasein the prison population.
"Even with this proposal, Missouri'sprison system is still going to be over-crowded and far over capacity."
What this is about is making sure we have a place tolock away violent criminals who need to be locked away so theywon't be in our schools and won't be in our neighborhoods.
Missouri's prison population is growing rapidly.
"It is expectedto increase from 17,400 inmates in 1994 to 27,500 in 1999, anincrease of over 10,000 in just five years."
"And this assumesthat we'll continue to utilize other alternative sanctions fornon-violent, non-dangerous, and non-chronic offenders."
But the fact is that more and more people are being convictedof dangerous and violent crimes.
Missourians are rightfully demandingtough medicine for tough crimes.
"And judges, prosecutors andjuries are responding with more aggressive prosecutions, longersentences, and less tolerance for criminal behavior."
"Now we have to do our job and make sure we havea padlocked cell to put these dangerous criminals in, so theycan't do any more harm to any more people."
"When Missouri first entered the Union, one of the first actsof the state legislature was to build a prison to lock away dangerouscriminals."
The secure incarceration of violent and dangerouscriminals is at the very core of the compact between a peopleand their government.
"If we fail to construct this new prison space, 6500 convictedfelons who should be behind bars will very likely be out on ourstreets."
"And based on Missouri's current inmate profile, thatwould include about 830 convicted murders, 750 convicted sexualoffenders, and almost 900 convicted drug offenders."
To allow that to happen would be a fundamental breach of thetrust and responsibility that the people of Missouri have placedin us.
I'm not prepared to let that happen and I don't think you areeither.Let's get this job done.
"The people of Missouri are counting on us to put these predatorsaway for the required duration of their sentences, without riskof inappropriate early release."
That's the challenge before us and that's the challenge wemust meet.
But there's still more we need to do this year on crime.
The recent slaying of two Lake of the Ozark security officersat the hands of two youthful offenders -- one 13 years of ageand the other 17 -- is a frightening example of how times havechanged and how our laws must change with them.
We must re-write our juvenile crime laws to make sure thatjuveniles who commit crimes are held responsible for their actions.
Juvenile offenders must be treated fairly -- but they muststill be held accountable for their crimes.
"If we don't hold them accountable for what they've done, thenwe shouldn't be surprised when they go back and do it again."
"We must work together to change our juvenile crime laws sothey are realistic, tough and effective in holding juveniles accountableand in preventing them from making a career out of crime."
Missouri's future is bursting with challenges and opportunities.
The actions we take here over the next few months will shapeour future and the futures of our children and grandchildren.
"As Missouri prepares to enter the 21st century, we must callupon the same courage and resolve as the first settlers who chosethis territory as their home."
They did not know all the possibilities of the future .
norall the dangers it would present.
They knew only that they wantedto carve out a life better than the one they had left behind.
But they also hoped that their hard work would shape the futureand make a difference for years to come .
a difference for theirchildren and their grandchildren.
Today we are the direct benefactors of an indomitable pioneerspirit.
"And just as their deeds had consequences on our lives, so will future generations live with the results ofwhat we do here."
I ask you to join with me in remembering that our legacy isour children's future.
"And whatever decisions we make, they willlive with the consequences for many years to come."
Let us strive to work together .
to put the small and unimportantthings aside .and focus on our common goal .
to leave Missourian even better place for our children and grandchildren to livethan it was for ourselves.Thank you.
