SENTENCES
"Speaker Bebout, President Twiford, First Lady Sherri, Supreme Court Justices, Tribal Leaders, distinguished legislators, staff, students, teachers and others watching by TV, listening statewide on the radio, or downloading from the Internet.Good Morning!"
"Mr. Speaker, thank you and the House members for your hospitality."
"Chief Justice Lehman I acknowledge your special guests, the third department of our government represented by district and county court judges from all around the state."
Welcome to the Budget Session of the 55th Wyoming Legislature.
"Mr. Speaker and Mr. President, please join me in welcoming two special guests this morning, Al Addison, Sr. Chairman of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, and John Washakie, Chairman of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe."
I have met several times with these leaders and other members of their tribes to discuss issues of mutual concern.
"For too long, we have allowed opportunity to pass us by as we have struggled, in isolation, to deal with the difficult issues that face us."
"Even though our traditions and cultures may differ in some respects, we each share the same vision: helping our citizens contribute to the future of the Reservation and, in turn, to the future of our State."
"By their special presence here today, we hope to continue the dialog of trust and understanding that we have begun."
"These leaders, elected by their respective tribes, have come to meet with you, to share the hopes and dreams of their people."
"The issues that I will discuss with you, today, are just as important to the Tribal authorities as they are to you, the elected and appointed leaders of the State."
Of particular and immediate concern are issues of water rights and taxation.
The longer-term issues are education and economic development.
"Creating a future for our children, enabling affordable housing, providing excellence in education, and assuring the availability of and access to health care are goals that we find easy to share across our tribal and state citizens."
I understand that all legislators are invited to join the Chairmen at a special reception to be held this evening.
I encourage you to extend your hand in friendship and cooperation.
Wyoming's Vision – Where Should We Be?
This year the decennial census will reaffirm that Wyoming is the least populated state in America.
"We are the state of high altitudes, low multitudes and great attitudes."
We need that great attitude as we face the challenges of today in a way that will assure success for tomorrow.
Wyoming people have an independent nature.
"But, with all the spaces between the places, here in the state, we have learned how to depend on each other."
"We are a team, each member with special talents, each with a shortcoming or two."
"As a team, we leverage strengths and minimize shortcomings."
"Together, as communities of Wyoming people, we can achieve what would be impossible to do alone."
"I challenge everyone listening today to think about the long-term future for Wyoming and to offer your personal best, as a member of the team, in creating that future."
We desperately need your help in setting the foundation for a long-term solution.
"In Lewis Carroll's book, Through the Looking Glass, Alice has an exchange with the Cheshire cat."
"When the cat asked Alice where she was going, Alice replied that she wasn't sure."
"To which the Cheshire cat replied “If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there!” If we are to achieve a long-term solution for Wyoming's future, we must know, not only where we want to go, but also how to get from here to there: the direction, the road, and the conveyance."
We must also be willing to demonstrate the level of passion and commitment needed to effect change.
We have been talking about a long-term plan for a number of years.
"During the past 12 months, we have written a long-term plan for Wyoming's future.We have done it as a team."
We have also communicated our long-term plan across Wyoming communities.
"Frankly, I've had about enough rhetoric and I expect that you have too."
It's time to stop talking and start doing something about securing a future for Wyoming.
"Each one of us has a particular, and sometimes peculiar, reason for living in Wyoming."
We also have visions of what we would like our state to be.
"We work, not only to develop the skills and the resources that will assure financial and spiritual security, but also to live our dreams."
"As Governor, I work at what I like to do in partnership with people that I respect and trust."
"My vision is for an even bigger partnership of Wyoming people working together, across communities, to build more and better opportunities for our children and grandchildren."
"Over and over in my visits to Wyoming communities, I hear your message- your vision for Wyoming."
You have asked for more jobs that pay higher wages.
You want better access to training and educational opportunities.
"You want safe communities and communities that are investing in growth and development.So do I!How, then, shall we proceed?"
How shall we move from where we are to where we want to be?
A Plan of Action Today to Deliver a Long-Term Solution for Tomorrow In order to create a long-term solution we must make some difficult choices.
Leadership is the art of leading people from where they are to where they ought to be.
"If we want to improve and diversify education and job opportunities, promote healthier families and safer communities, and invest in growth and development in Wyoming communities then each of us must be willing to bear additional responsibility."
"This may include a decrease in the availability of existing services, a change in the way that services have been delivered historically, or even new models of cost sharing between government and the citizens we serve."
"The long-term solution that I propose, for Wyoming, includes the following four strategies: Limit the growth of government Reallocate and maximize current revenues Broaden the education tax base Improve customer service and enhance government accountability by focusing on results over process Developing the New Economy Winston Churchill once said, “The further backward you look, the further forward you can see."
We must not ignore our past but must carefully weave the best of the past into a plan for our future.
"Wyoming's traditional economy has been dominated by the extraction and production of energy and raw materials, tourism and agricultural products."
"In order to build a more diversified economy, we must continue to invest in additional infrastructure that will support new and growing technologies."
"Wyoming's workforce will need to upgrade its skills and knowledge base in order to be competitive, in our region, in our nation and in the global economy."
What do I mean by the New Economy?
"The New Economy means that: Competition is relentless Technology is here to stay Knowledge builds wealth People are the most important resource There's no such thing as a smooth ride Alliances or partnerships are the way to get things done The location still matters, but now business comes to the worker, not vice versa The New Economy is characterized by a shift from traditional manufacturing to knowledge-based businesses."
The common denominator for all business will be increased global competition and decreased regulation.
"Access to cutting edge research, venture capital, sophisticated communications networks and to pools of highly skilled workers will be standard requirements to sustain and grow businesses throughout the State."
That's true for existing as well as for new businesses.
"Technology will be used, not only to leverage the production of products and services, but also to sell, market and distribute these outputs."
"While our national economy will continue to need Wyoming's ample supply of energy and raw materials, our goals for real wage growth and economic development in Wyoming will require a heavy investment in human resources, particularly in our youth."
Recommendation: Focus our energy and finite resources to leverage the current economy and to enhance our ability to compete in the New Economy.
We have worked to encourage and install additional fiber-optic networks and high-technology incubators.
We have encouraged more reliable air service by supporting the relocation of Great Lakes Aviation to Cheyenne.
"Through the combination of state and federal funding, we have substantially increased traditional transportation and other infrastructure investments."
We have focused on greater investment in workforce development and improving the quality of life to attract and retain employers from across the country.
We continue to encourage Wyoming people to expand and innovate within their existing businesses.
"Equally important to growing the economy is improving the quality of education, ensuring that today's children have the skills to compete in tomorrow's economy."
The New Economy places a high value on knowledge and the ability to add value to a company through knowledge.
That's why education is the centerpiece of my budget.
"But the New Economy needs some old fashioned economic support as well, such as a stable tax structure, competitive labor costs, access to capital and a favorable regulatory climate."
"New business spin-offs, particularly in manufacturing and technology, are more likely to occur if we have a high quality University that focuses on research along with undergraduate and graduate education."
The Wyoming Business Council Broad-band connectivity using technology.Reliable air service.Quality workforce.
These three are the vital signs of the New Economy.
But they only shape the foundation.
"Beyond that, we need professional assistance and guidance for our communities and for our businesses to help them grow and be competitive."
"If we hope to meet or to exceed the capabilities of the competition, we must have a support structure such as the Business Council."
"You, the legislature, created the Business Council not because the governor wanted it."
"You created the Business Council because your neighbors, your businesses, and your communities demanded it."
The Business Council has made a good start.It can and will do better.
The Wyoming Business Council was created to end fragmentation of state and local economic development efforts.
They developed a long-term plan based on a vision of targeted growth and quality of life.
They have helped our communities design what they want for growth in jobs and income and define who will make the design work.
Wyoming's young people deserve a better chance at success.
Wyoming's families deserve a higher level of income.
The Business Council has brought together the people and the processes we need to help our communities achieve these goals.Now it's your turn.
"Recommendation: Give the Business Council the guidance you believe they lack, give them the resources they need to do the job and give them your support."
The criteria for success aren't whether the Business Council gets a budget by the end of this session.
The real criteria must focus on giving Wyoming's people a chance to succeed.
"Identifying the Challenges If this is the Budget Session, we must be talking about a deficit."
Where are we in terms of a budget crisis?
"A year ago, during the 1999 Legislative Session, you enacted Section 335 in the appropriations bill."
The language of this section provided for an assessment of state revenues and expenditures.
"Nearly every one of you participated in a joint legislative-executive review of state programs, services and the money to fund them."
"The big picture, or “Macro” report came out in May with a summary of over 100 reports that had previously studied some part of the state's revenues and expenditures."
"The Macro Report stated that the anticipated deficit facing us this year would be $127M, assuming no change in salaries, education, health services, corrections or troubled youth programs."
The report also stated that the underlying deficit was really $183M if we looked beyond the cash carryover in reserves.
Today the $127M shortfall that was forecast last spring for the 2001-2002 budget period has shrunk to zero.
"Though the pressure for change is not as noticeable, the long-term deficit remains."
The underlying deficit is still at least $183M and could be over $200M two years from now.
The final report that we published last September acknowledged that the deficit would reoccur if long-term solutions were not put into place.
That study compiled the results of the review of over 220 state programs and concluded that no significant program reductions could be made.
The single most significant finding was that Education was driving the shortage of funds.
The budget that I prepared and submitted to you in December was based on your participation and recommendations.
I gave you one budget with a road map on how to balance within existing revenues and current law.
I also gave you a second budget that provided strategies for a long-term solution.
"Recommendation: I strongly recommend that you look beyond the next two years, to the longer-term."
How much will be spent in the future?
I refer you to the charts in the printed copies of this message that are titled “General Fund Revenues and Expenditures-Total.
"These spending projections are intended to give you the best, the medium and the worst-case scenarios for the state over the next eight years."
"The best case, titled “low” shows that after 2004, the biennial deficit will be approximately $200M.Is that really the best case?Is it even the likely case?I don't know."
"But, if you look at the trend of past revenues and expenditures, the trend is much more like the Medium case, which forecasts that expenditures will increase at an alarming rate compared to income."
"Two years from now, the deficit would be $150M and by the year 2008 the biennial deficit would grow to nearly $600M."
I didn't make these numbers up.
The revenue numbers are taken from the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group forecasts.
The expenditures are taken from the Final Report of the Oversight Committee that presented the Revenue and Expenditure Report.
That final report assumed that the expenditures for this biennium would be the same as what they were in January 1999.
The assumptions didn't forecast the increases we're experiencing in Education or Corrections.
"Perhaps even more sobering are the charts, at the back part of my written message, that show major areas of expenditure."
"If education expenses were to stay constant over the next eight years, they would still amount to 44% of the total general fund."
"But if they grow at the same rate that they have over the past eight years, education would consume over two-thirds of the entire general fund, a 50% increase in general fund support for education as compared to today."
"Additional charts in the appendix to this message show that the other big expenditure areas of state government will grow, but that their demand on the general fund is nothing nearly as dramatic as the demand from education."
"Even if Corrections were to grow at a rate faster than this year, its impact is relatively small by comparison to Education."
"The last category, expenditures in General Government, is flat and its impact on the general fund is lost in the noise level."
"In fact, if you removed my recommendations for salary adjustments, the cost of General Government, or “Other” expenditures would continue to decline."
"It's the only area of government that has held the line, yet it would be hit the hardest by the proposed cuts in the Joint Appropriations Committee recommendations."
I ask you not to punish these good managers any further.
"Recommendation: Give agency personnel the recognition they deserve, for their efforts in increasing efficiencies, by restoring the 200 series cuts."
The reason for these forecasts is to demonstrate that today's deficit is masked by a temporary reprieve.You have a choice.
You can patch things up in the manner and tradition of the past twelve years and go home.
"Or, you can recognize the inherent weaknesses in our revenue system and enact a long-term solution."
Recommendation: I strongly urge you to pick the long-term approach.
"The Big Four As I have traveled around Wyoming visiting with your neighbors, I hear a lot about cutting government."
I also hear that we should put more money into education and economic development.
Just where does the state's money go?
Where do we spend the most money?
"Four big categories of spending dominate the state's budget: Education, which includes public schools, community colleges and the University, consumes 44% of the general fund budget."
"Health care, primarily for low-income citizens, takes another 24%."
"Public safety, which includes the Corrections system, the judiciary and the public defender, takes 13%."
"Human resources, dominated by programs in Family Services, totals 7%."
The total for just these four functional areas is 88% of my budget recommendation.
The reason that current and past legislatures have been unable to cut government spending is that these programs are people centered.
"Any substantial reduction would severely impact people, especially those who are least able to provide for themselves."
"The remaining three functional categories of spending are: General Government, which includes such departments as Audit, Revenue, Board of Equalization, the five elected officials and the Legislature; 7% of total general fund spending."
"Natural resources, which include the state lands office, state engineer, Department of Ag, DEQ and water development; 3% of general spending."
"Economic Development, which includes state parks, cultural resources, fire prevention and the Business Council; 2% of general fund spending."
"The Business Council, by itself, is allocated approximately 1% of the budget."
One-half of that amount is dedicated to Tourism and Promotion.
The inherent and long-term deficit in general fund revenue is between 15 and 20% of the budget.
"Even if we were to eliminate all of General Government, Natural Resources and Economic Development, we would not have balanced the budget."
"That stark and dramatic statement illustrates the false, but common, misconception that government is a bloated bureaucracy."
Education and growing the economy are the two things people talk to me about the most.
We spend over a thousand times more money on education than we do on economic development.
Yet we speak little of the accountability for education and much about accountability for the Business Council.
"EDUCATION Clearly, education is driving the deficit."
"That's not a criticism, only a statement of fact.Why are the costs so high?How high will they go?"
"Looking at the forecast of education expenditures, the cost of education will continue to go up, particularly if we have the economic recovery that we want."
"The chart shown in your message book illustrates that student enrollment in grades K-12 peaked in 1985 at 103,000 students."
"Today, fifteen years later, Wyoming has about the same statewide population as we did in 1985, but the student enrollment in our schools is below 89,000 students, a decline of over 14,000 students."
"The message is twofold: first, the total number of school age kids is declining while the total cost, per student, continues to increase; second, the number of young families with children in Wyoming continues to decline."
"If we were to achieve our goals of economic growth, we would have a higher percentage of young families with school age children."
"Considering that the total combined state and local expenditures per child is over $7500 per year, the addition of another 10,000 kids over the next ten years would add $75M per year or $150M per biennium to the state's budget just for the increase in student count."
We must realize that any new revenues will be an education tax.
"Put in a different perspective, if Wyoming today had 103,000 students, as we did in 1985, the education budget would be another $195M short in comparison."
Do we want that kind of student growth?
"I believe we do because it reflects the vitality of Wyoming, the opportunity to be competitive."
That trend by itself is ample justification for broadening Wyoming's tax base.
"I've been told time and again that people are willing to spend more on education and some other state services, but they are not willing to tax themselves."
The prevailing opinion is that somebody besides “me” should pay!
Recommendation: We must link our goals with our revenue systems and broaden the base to include an education tax.
School Finance Litigation The education agenda that you adopted beginning in 1997 is reflected in my budget this session.
"We have spent an enormous amount of time, talent, energy and money responding to the solution dictated by the Supreme Court in 1995."
That decision has been a source of great concern as well as serving as a catalyst for change.
The 1995 decision provided direction for constitutional compliance and specified minute details of education policy that are arguably outside the prerogative of the judiciary.
"Nevertheless, the issues have been litigated ad nauseam, and are now back in front of the Supreme Court."
"I report to you today that of the 21 legal issues, decided by the District Court of Cheyenne, 17 of them have been decided in favor of the State, which is to say, in favor of the legislative directives you have in place regarding school finance."
"Of the remaining four issues, the one specifying that schools within a quarter of a mile of each other cannot qualify for small school funding, is being phased out, as the law has been removed."
The three remaining issues that were ruled unconstitutional by the District Court are of great concern to the legislative and executive branches.
These issues could easily be found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court.
"The three dealt with small school adjustment, the small district adjustment and the cost of living adjustment."
"Judge Kalokathis stated in his decision that “After considering the parties' respective studies, this court finds that the State has met its burden of proving that the revised school funding system is adequate to provide the basket of educational goods and services to Wyoming's students.(Decision, p.10, Para.2)."
"I interpret that statement to mean that the funding system, which you, the elected representatives of the people adopted, is adequate to provide for our kids' education."
You are to be congratulated for that achievement.
"In 1995 you were presented, by the Supreme Court, with a giant and complicated puzzle, which you have successfully solved."
"I now hope that the Supreme Court will see fit to restore and accredit that part of your work dealing with small schools, small school districts and the regional cost of living adjustments."
Those are three important pieces of the puzzle.
"As with any puzzle, if pieces are removed the picture is incomplete; and, so it is with the school finance picture."
The judicial branch must be sensitive to the law of unintended consequences.
"In his order, Judge Kalokathis recognized the reality that we will never have perfection in the development of a cost-based model."
He specifically referred to “the limitations inherent in any cost of education model.
"The model cannot accurately reflect the exact cost of education, and large portions of the model are the product of professional judgment; both of the model's designers and of Wyoming educators who contributed their expertise to its design.(Decision, p. 12, Para."
4) Everyone in Wyoming has an interest and an investment in our small schools and our small districts.
I assure the people of Wyoming's smallest towns and rural areas that we will vigorously defend the historically important concept of local control and adequate funding for small schools and small school districts.
"Mr. Chief Justice, you and your colleagues are faced with a critically important task in reviewing the Wyoming legislature's work product on school finance reform."
Much is at stake for all three branches of government and much is at stake for our citizens.
I urge your careful and expeditious consideration.
We look forward to an early and final decision.
Improving the Quality of Education Let's not become distracted by the cost of education.
"Rather, let's focus on what the cost should yield and then focus on accountability for the dollars spent."
Education at all levels is my number one priority.
"My goal is the same as that of your Superintendent of Public Instruction, Judy Catchpole."
Judy speaks passionately of how everything that happens in our public schools should focus on one thing- student improvement.
Education is the foundation upon which everything else is built.
"It is the key to Wyoming's mastery of the social, personal and economic goals of the new millennium."
"Education, training and skills today account for 75% of the nation's wealth and growth and 50% of all capital spending."
Our knowledge-based economy is creating tremendous competition for high quality human resources.
Business can't find enough skilled workers.
We have worker shortages in every field of employment.
We need to increase the potential of every person in Wyoming.
Recruiting and Retaining Qualified Teachers Teacher quality is the greatest factor in student achievement.
"And, we know the risk of losing some of our best and brightest teachers is increasing."
"The competition to hire quality teachers, in all employment sectors, is at an all time high."
What are we doing to enhance recruitment and retention in Wyoming?
We are using technology to create a virtual academy to provide on-line professional development opportunities.
The University of Wyoming has established mentor programs to help new teachers through the difficult early years.
"In addition, the State Professional Teaching Standards Board has received a three-year federal grant worth over $2.7M to evaluate how to recruit and retain teachers in rural areas, including teachers on the Reservation."
"You, the Legislature, have offered bonuses to teachers who achieve certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards."
The funding model you adopted for the schools includes support for professional development.
Now the challenge will be to assure that we have proper preparation and evaluation programs from the University of Wyoming to the K-12 classroom level.
Standards You directed that standards for student achievement be set in twelve academic areas.
The State Board of Education has adopted several already.
I support the direction you have established and further support Superintendent Catchpole's advocacy for maintaining those high standards.
We must be clear on what it is that we want our children to know.
Recommendation: Don't change the statutes that establish education standards.
"Assessment In turn, we should be able to tell what our kids have learned and how well they have learned it."
"Wyoming educators, business people and parents all helped design the statewide accountability tests known as the Wyoming Comprehensive Assessment System, or WyCAS."
These tests do measure learning.
Their purpose is to decide how that learning can be improved.
"The goal is to build a foundation, not to find fault."
"What we discovered in the first round of testing is that only about a third of our students are proficient or above in the fundamentals of education: reading, writing and math.Should we be alarmed?No."
But we should be concerned enough to aggressively work for continued improvement.
Recommendation: Don't change the assessment statutes.
"Technology In 1997, you directed that all schools should be connected to a learning network such that all schools would have access to the Internet and that our high schools would have voice, data and video connectivity."
My budget recommendation includes the funding request to move the process along to the next level of implementation.
Another first for Wyoming occurred when schools opened their doors last fall.
We were the first state to document having ALL of our schools connected to the Internet.
Several states have a high degree of connectivity but we were the first to prove that all our schools are connected.
"By the end of this year, we will also have two-way interactive video capability between and among all of our high schools, our community colleges and the University of Wyoming."
Technology properly applied is never an end in itself.
"It should and must be used to enable our schools to improve the process of education, both for academic and administrative purposes."
Technology properly applied will give teachers the gift of time and students the gift of discovery learning.
"In addition, parents and prospective employers will receive the gift of demonstrated achievement in ways that would not otherwise be possible."
Early Childhood We recognize that education starts before children enter school.
Children who receive care and attention from birth have a tremendously increased chance for success when they enter school.
"We must continue to improve the quality of early care and education, supporting parents as children's first teachers and assuring access to proper nutrition and health care."
I encourage and support the work of the Governor's Early Childhood Development Council.
"I continue to support Wyoming's role as a leader in the use of the Health Passport, or SmartCard, to help deliver nutrition, health care and early childhood education in Wyoming."
We are the center of attention on how this relatively simple use of technology will enhance access to and quality of health care for families at risk.
"As a result of the Newborn Screening Program that you adopted, we can point to several examples of children who will develop at a normal rate."
"In the past, hearing problems were not likely to be detected until the child was at least two years old, and in many cases, even older."
We now screen nearly all of the 5500 births in our state.
"Of those screened, 3% are referred for further evaluation, and when needed, appropriate treatment is provided."
Reading Reading is such a critical factor in educational success.
Improving the literacy skills of our children is the gateway to their successful future.
"I support the commitment of additional state resources to helping all children read at grade level, especially in the early grades."
Higher Education Wyoming will not grow if we cannot compete.
Our ability to compete in the business world or in developing the next generation of leaders depends heavily on our system of higher education.
The budgets that I recommended for the University of Wyoming and the seven Community Colleges are in a different format.
"The old formula for determining funding levels was arbitrarily tied to several factors that, in the long run, would not allow us to effectively compete for quality students and faculty and would not assure our graduates that they would be able to achieve excellence in learning."
"As I noted earlier, Wyoming is reflecting the national trend of having fewer college age students available for the next several years."
"In order to meet our economic and social goals, we need quality students to assure quality institutions and quality faculty to enable learning."
Each is enhanced by the others.
"If our community colleges and the University of Wyoming are going to be able to compete for the quality of faculty, staff and students that we want, they have to be able to compete with peer institutions."
The funding formulas used to calculate the level of support for the Community Colleges recognizes the importance of keeping up with the competition.
Each college has a set of comparator institutions that establish the base funding for that college.
"From there, factors to add to that base determine the additional, or “plus” funding."
"Likewise, I drew from a set of comparators for the University of Wyoming to keep them in the fray, competitive and effective."
Recommendation: I urge you to adopt the appropriate funding levels that will benefit students by enhancing our institutions of higher learning.
"We must support not only the traditional student graduating from high school, but also the continuing need to deliver professional courses, academic degrees and skill training to the workers in our businesses independently of time and place."
"Capital Construction In spite of the pleadings by plaintiff districts and the Wyoming Education Association, the District Court refused to appoint a special master to oversee the collection and distribution of funds for public school building construction."
I wholeheartedly agree with that decision.
The appointment of a special master would have been a blatant encroachment on the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Legislature.
We do realize that public schools will require major maintenance and new construction on a regular basis.
You enacted a public funding process that allows local involvement in the process.
I continue to support the current legislation and urge the Supreme Court to concur.
I suggest increasing the statewide mill levy by two mills to help shoulder the state's share of capital construction.
"In 1997, the Legislature repealed the so-called discretionary mills that authorized the imposition of up to six additional mills."
The statewide average mill levy was approximately four and a half mills.
Recommendation: Reinstate two of the mills to help fund the construction needs of our schools.
"HEALTH As I lay out the remaining three areas of the Big Four, I want to stress that our emphasis should be on prevention and early intervention rather than on more costly alternatives such as incarceration, unemployment and treatment."
Pay some now or pay a lot more later to fix bigger problems or to avert an impending crisis.
"The expense is not just to government, but also to society as a whole."
Health care programs in Wyoming consume nearly one-fourth of the entire general fund expenditures.
"Those dollars in turn, leverage many more matching funds that assure an appropriate level of care for people who would not otherwise receive care."
Medicaid expenses are the single largest part of the Department of Health budget.
"Within that program, we allocate dollars to a variety of programs and services."
Two-thirds of the total clients are young families with children.
"However, two-thirds of the dollars spent go to the elderly, particularly for skilled nursing care."
The federal Medicaid program requires that every state provide a basic set of services and then allows other programs to be added as options.
"Wyoming covers only the basic mandated set of health services with the exception of prescription drugs, which is optional under federal law, but of high priority in Wyoming."
"While the Health budget has only modest increases overall, several programs are proposed for increased funding."
"The cost for prescription drugs, just to maintain the current program and services will require a $10M increase."
"The rising cost of drugs seems out of control, and is not expected to stabilize in the foreseeable future."
"I note that the JAC denied my request for $1.5M in additional funds for the current year that are needed to cover prescription drugs through June 30,2000."
"Since Wyoming law mandates the drug program, I am obligated to provide the funding."
"My only choice is to transfer from other programs for the elderly to assure the availability of medications, which I will do if necessary."
My budget recommends funding for phasing in the Wyoming Kid Care program for children not covered by any other insurance.
"The cost in this budget is only about a fourth of what we anticipate it will cost after the next two years, depending on how many eligible kids are enrolled."
This is exactly the kind of prevention effort that we should support.
"I have also proposed an increase in funding for the elderly to include increased home based care, funding for the Senior Companion program and increases to protect elder rights."
Money spent on in-home or community-based care is the most efficient that we can spend.
I will continue to support cost effective and care efficient home and community-based programs within the department.
"I note however, that over the next ten years, the fastest growing segment of our population in the state will be in the age groups above age 55."
"Considering that on average, 10% of people over 65 will qualify for some level of state funded care, we must anticipate steady upward pressure on the funding needed just to maintain our current programs."
The Department has had many successes over the past two years.
The Division for Developmental Disabilities received the national Ben Censoni Award for Excellence in Public Service for outstanding community based services to the developmentally disabled.
"Methamphetamine I mention this program in relationship to Health, since that is where the majority of the funding is located."
"The initiative that you authorized last year is under way with the support of the Departments of Education, Corrections, DCI, Family Services and local governments."
A pilot project to open a prevention and intensive treatment center in Sweetwater County now has the strong support of the City Council of Green River as well as the Sweetwater County Commissioners.
"Last year, the Division of Criminal Investigation seized and closed 20 clandestine meth manufacturing operations in Wyoming."
That's a ten-fold increase in the number of labs discovered and closed in Wyoming over the past two years.
We will continue to educate our young people about the terrible effects of Meth usage.
"And, we must push even harder to develop early intervention and extended treatment programs."
We will champion for more effective counseling to help people solve the problems that lead to the use of Meth.
"All these actions are geared toward decreasing demand for the drug, which in the long run, is the most effective way to decrease supply."
"Nonetheless, we will continue our support of interagency cooperation among state, local and federal drug enforcement teams in order to eliminate the manufacture and supply of Methamphetamine in Wyoming."
"We are privileged to have the nation's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey as a special visitor to Wyoming."
"During his visit over the next two days, we will find a great friend in our effort to keep our citizens from using illegal drugs."
General McCaffrey's central message is the same as ours in Wyoming- drug abuse is like a cancer.
"We must eliminate this scourge through prevention, treatment and education."
"My special thanks to you, President Twiford, for your gracious invitation to have General McCaffrey address the Legislature in the Senate Chambers on Wednesday."
"By the time he finishes his talk, you will be stirred to action and to service to our citizens like never before."
FAMILY SERVICES Wyoming leads all fifty states in the percentage reduction of welfare caseload.
We have dramatically reduced direct grant payments over the past five years.
"More than just a reduction in numbers, the Department has gone on to develop opportunities for self-sufficiency of clients."
"We have received national awards and incentive payments for superior performance in welfare reform, child support enforcement, food stamp benefit accuracy and the high rate of adoptions for children."
These achievements are extraordinary and we recognize the hard work and commitment given by our employees.
Equally important is the benefit it brings to the children.
We are now in the process of increasing the definition of what's called the state's Maintenance of Effort.
That term stands for the amount of funds that the state must continue to pay out of state dollars in order to qualify for federal matching funds.
The state must spend all of our dollars first before federal funds are released.
"We've done such a good job at reducing the demand for services, that we can't satisfy the feds to turn loose of over $54M in federal funds that should come to Wyoming to enhance childcare, education of clients, and enhanced social services."
We continue to be disturbed by the trend of troubled youth and their actions.
The single largest area of increased spending in the Family Services budget is for kids who are taken out of their homes because they are abused or because they are abusing someone else.
We are concerned for both the impact on society and for the impact on the budget.
Serious substance abuse in rural America has become epidemic.
"Young people in rural areas have become 50% to 75% more likely to have used methamphetamine, cocaine and other hard drugs than young people living in our largest cities."
Wyoming has not been immune from this epidemic.
"A few years ago, directors of our law-enforcement, health, family services and corrections agencies began documenting alarming problem rates in our own state."
Wyoming may have been the first state to notice and act on this sudden shift in America.
The Wyoming Methamphetamine Initiative is unique among concerted efforts by state governments to affect the demand and control of very dangerous substances.
"The Governor's Substance Abuse & Violent Crime Advisory Board, the State Advisory Council on Juvenile Justice, and the Tobacco Settlement Committee are working together to create a comprehensive, integrated approach to prevention and intervention of the conditions that have caused this scourge on our youth."
This comprehensive approach is designed to turn around the epidemic.
The Pilot Project in Sweetwater County is considered to be a model of the comprehensive approach.
"We have created a blueprint to help shape our policy and practices toward early intervention, prevention efforts in our schools and communities, and treatment and public-safety initiatives."
"The Governor's Tobacco Settlement Committee has recommended a plan for tobacco-use prevention, cessation and treatment in our state."
"The plan focuses on health, wellness and safety of our citizens."
"The committee recommends that we use only the interest from the Tobacco Settlement, keeping the principal of the fund inviolate."
Scientific findings have shown that early tobacco is a gateway to other drug use.
The Committee recommends a plan for lowering the sales and use of tobacco to minors.
This strategy has the potential to alleviate the threat of additional sanctions from the federal government.
Recommendation: Make tobacco use prevention the primary focus during the early years of the tobacco settlement while the interest earnings are small.
Incorporate other uses for the funds as interest earnings increase.
CORRECTIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY The rate of increase in the budget for the Department of Corrections over the past several years is the largest rate of increase for any state program.
"While the cost of education is still the largest in terms of overall spending, the cost of providing incarceration and rehabilitation of convicted felons has increased by seven-fold over the past twenty years."
"Twenty years ago, Wyoming's total population was roughly the same as it is today."
"However, we have twice as many men and women locked up in a penitentiary setting as we did 20 years ago."
But more significant is the five-fold increase in the number of placements in intermediate sanctions.
"Twenty years ago we had just over 1,000 felons in supervised settings.Today we have over 5,000."
"We have dramatically increased programming for intensive treatment, intensive supervision, probation, community corrections, electronic monitoring and programs aimed at transitioning lower risk felons into community settings where they can support themselves and their families."
The limiting factors are funding and personnel.
"While the men's penitentiary at Rawlins has drawn most of the publicity lately, the real work of making the convicts productive in society has largely gone unnoticed, even though it has the potential for better results."
Recommendation: Continue to support Restorative Justice and intermediate sanctions.
"Get Out of Jail Free For those of you who have advocated that I, as Governor, be more lenient in granting pardons and commutations, thereby reducing the number of felons in custody, I will not substitute my executive authority for a lack of statutory directives."
"The authority that I have as Governor to set aside the work of law enforcement, prosecutor, judge and jury and in some cases ignore the victim's rights, is not something that I take lightly."
The power to pardon is to be used with great discretion and reserved for only the most unusual of circumstances to compensate for unintended consequences or legal actions.
"The Legislature, collectively, must change the law if leniency is the preferred alternative."
"Pardons and clemency are reserved to preserve justice and fairness, not to substitute for lack of proper planning."
We will have fairness and we will take care of the victims of crime.
We will always give higher consideration to fairness and the impact of crime than to the economic or social inconvenience of incarceration.
"Men's Penitentiary – New, old or ??"
We have worked hard to help the JAC arrive at a compromise to meet our needs for prisoner confinement.
I support the compromise plan worked up for the JAC and recommended by them to you.
"The alternative plan in general, calls for expansion of the new prison being built to accommodate over 200 more prisoners, recommends improvements for life and safety codes in the present penitentiary, provides for new kitchen and laundry facilities, upgrades prisoner housing at the current facility and increases the salary of certain corrections officials."
I differ from the JAC in how much the salary adjustment should be.
"Recommendation: That the amount of funds be higher and allocated more broadly to ease the shortage of qualified personnel in all of our corrections programs, including those at the community level."
We are also subject to federal sanctions if we don't ease the overcrowding that will still exist in both the men's and women's prisons.
We need to provide for the safety of the officials who staff both prisons and to assure the public safety and security.
"Whether the contract beds are in or out of state, in county jails or private prisons, you have provided statutory limitations on placement and assurances for public safety."
The only missing item is funding.
We have creatively used federal funding to pay most of the cost of out of state placements of the men in Colorado and the women in Oklahoma.
I have no assurance that those federal funds will continue.
"Should they decrease or should our authority to use them go away, we must provide for proper prisoner placement and management."
Recommendation: Provide funding for contract placement of both men and women felons.
"Public Defender Under Wyoming law and the federal constitution, a person accused of a crime must have adequate legal representation."
The Public Defender budget has been hammered hard lately with the rash of murder accusations and convictions.
Of particular concern is the JAC recommendation to not allocate sufficient additional funds to finish the current year.
"If my recommendation is not restored, the Public Defender will have to suspend services for approximately six weeks until the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1."
"Since I have no interagency flexibility or executive discretion to reallocate funds between agencies, temporary suspension of the Public Defender's office would be necessary."
Recommendation: Restore the funds needed to provide adequate representation for the remainder of this fiscal year.
The Budget: 2000 and Beyond How did we get to this deficit problem?
The mineral boom of the late 70's and early 80's brought considerable wealth to Wyoming.
"Wyoming used that newly found wealth to build several new programs and to upgrade state and local infrastructure, from water development to school buildings to university classrooms to utility improvements in our towns."
"After the boom fizzled in the mid-80's, Wyoming officials managed to cut spending, especially for education, spent down reserves and continued to cling to the hope that either the boom would return or that the need for government services would decline."
"The post-boom strategy was to wait it out, not get too involved in change."
Then the BIG EVENT came in 1995 with the Supreme Court decision on education finance.
"Not only did the state have to provide an equitable education funding formula, it had to prove that every student had equity of opportunity for an education."
"With that decision, the choice to wait out the storm was gone."
Wyoming could no longer depend upon patching things up.
Wyoming needs a long-term solution.
We can't expect that energy prices or production will somehow rebound at the right time or that another wealthy resident will deliver unexpected millions to the state in inheritance taxes.
The cost of education will dominate the cost of state services.
We must act now and commit to a long-term solution.
"The Plan: Limit the growth of government, reallocate and maximize current revenues, broaden the education tax base, and improve customer service and enhance government accountability by focusing on results over process."
My earlier comments on the agencies and issues have outlined the way we are working to improve customer service and enhance government accountability by focusing on results over process.
History of Revenue The majority of funds for state government services have come from mineral taxes.
"While that is convenient as a means of exporting the taxes, it doesn't afford us any measure of control over our destiny."
"Most mineral extraction is administered under the policies of our absentee landlord, the federal government."
The policies for production and marketing are under the control of boards of directors of companies and of foreign governments that are far removed from Wyoming.
Those two factors plague the predictability of state funding and lead to wide swings in revenue production for the state.
Much discussion lately has centered on mineral taxes and whether they are high enough.
"Your predecessors, in the legislature, worked hard to keep a balance between taxes that are fair and tax breaks that would stimulate further production and income."
"Last year, you approved the Oil Recovery Act to give a temporary reprieve to an industry that was being rocked by world price instability."
"Today, a year later, oil has made a dramatic recovery in price."
Several oil wells that might have had to shut down are now available to generate more jobs and income for the state.
This would not have happened without your help.
The return on the state's investment is as large as if we had invested in one of the high-flying “dot com” companies!
I have suggested a variety of ways to help fund the education deficit.
"I'm suggesting a menu of options, a map of how to start down a path of broadening the tax base that should decrease the volatility of energy policies and practices."
Broadening the tax base also means an increase in personal responsibility for the cost of services.
Wyoming's individual tax burden is among the lowest of all the states.
We all know what we want for services.
"In the words of one of our Cheyenne residents “If we pay, we will pay attention."
"A Casper resident said “For the last 25 years we have done very well at asking what services we want, and identifying those services."
"What we have failed to say is how will we step up and pay for them?"""
"I am proposing that we diversify our income in three major areas: increase the return on state investments; reallocate some of our earmarked funds; and, broaden the tax base to bring revenue in from areas that to date have been excluded or exempted from paying taxes."
"Any tax increase is an education tax, driven by the need to stabilize income for our schools."
"Overall, my revenue recommendations would increase the tax on minerals and industry, so there are no breaks for minerals."
"Beyond that, the principal part of my revenue package involves imposing broad taxes on gasoline and fuels and removing the sales tax exclusion on services."
I also suggest a statewide two-mill levy to help fund the ever-increasing needs of education facilities.
Reallocate and maximize current revenues: Increase State Treasurer Investment Returns State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis has proposed two significant legislative changes that I strongly endorse.
The first deals with the authority of the state and local entities to use tax and revenue anticipation notes.
The proposed legislation would change the frequency and timing of revenue distribution thereby enabling the state to gain short-term investment returns that would not have been possible otherwise.
The potential income could be several million dollars each year.
The second legislative change would be to increase the allowable investments by the Treasurer in equities.
"With the system of checks and balances imposed by the Legislature, the safety and security of the state's funds would be assured while increasing the return on investment substantially."
The enhanced level of income could be $25M per year after the gradual phasing in of the investment authority.
"We would not expect the enhanced revenues for at least two to four years, but the measure is a strong part of a long-term strategy."
Recommendation: Enact bills to support the State Treasurer's Investments.
Earmarked Revenue Over the years the Legislature has given the highest priority for allocating revenue directly to the agency spending the money.
"Education, local governments, transportation and water development are the four primary recipients of earmarked funding."
"In a perfect world, all revenues collected by the state would be deposited into the General Fund."
Then all requests for expenditure would be reviewed and funds allocated on a priority and need basis.
The reality is that earmarking becomes a convenient way to designate spending priorities without periodic review.
"Problems arise when the earmarked money isn't enough, as in the case of education, or when the priority for spending in one area falls low enough to justify a reallocation of funds."
Recommendation: I support placing the interest earned on the Water Development Accounts into the General Fund to ease the education funding needs.
I would also support diversion of a portion of the federal mineral royalties from Transportation into an Education Equity Fund which I am recommending be created.
I support placing a cap of $200M per year on severance taxes and federal mineral royalties.
Any income above that threshold would be deposited in the Education Equity Fund.
I also support charging an administrative fee for the collection and distribution of the mineral royalties and taxes.
"Broaden the education tax base: Remove the Sunset Date on the Fourth Cent Sales Tax Two years from now, in 2002, the authority for the fourth cent sales tax will expire."
It's time to realize that the state will not be able to reduce funding to accommodate the loss of over $150M in the biennium.
Broaden the Base No tax is reasonable if the capacity to pay isn't there.
My recommendations rest in part on the assumption that our economy will grow and that the need for services will be matched by the growth in revenue generated by broadening the tax base.
"No matter how we might analyze the budget situation, the shortfall in education funding is driving the need for more revenue."
"Even with increased spending for Health and Public Safety, those programs would not require increasing general fund revenue if the School Foundation Program had sufficient income."
"My recommendations that follow are targeted for Education, from K-12 through Community Colleges and the University of Wyoming."
"Gasoline and Fuel Taxes In order to sustain the long-term needs of the state's transportation systems, I recommend that gasoline and fuel taxes be increased beginning in 2001 to offset the loss of earmarked mineral royalties."
Your Joint Revenue Committee is sponsoring a bill to increase the gasoline and fuel taxes by eight cents per gallon.
I recommend that the increase be less than that.
"For gasoline, I recommend that the increase be no more than six cents per gallon, and that fuel taxes be no more than four cents per gallon, with exemptions for off-road usage, but without local revenue sharing."
A reduction in federal mineral royalties earmarked for transportation would match the amount generated by the gasoline and fuel taxes.
The federal mineral royalties would then be deposited in the Education Equity Fund.
Remove Sales and Use Tax Exclusions on Services / Grant sales tax exemptions for food and water This proposed tax is by far the most effective in meeting our goals of broadening the tax base and increasing awareness for the cost of education and government services.
It is also the most controversial.
"The most expedient thing to do politically would be to increase a series of taxes, each one of which would only affect a minority of our Wyoming citizens."
The proposed sales tax on services sponsored by your Joint Revenue Committee will in one way or another affect a broad base of Wyoming citizens.
"That's an extreme political risk, but it's worth taking to provide a long-term solution."
Several factors justify removing the exclusion on taxing services.
"First, we must realize that the opportunity to tax goods is quickly being eroded by the growth in E-Commerce, or on-line sales over the Internet."
Wyoming is at a great disadvantage since the primary vendors of Internet sales don't have a presence in Wyoming.
Collection of sales taxes is nearly impossible and collection of use taxes will depend on whether Wyoming citizens realize that they still owe a use tax and must voluntarily report it to the State Department of Revenue.
I don't anticipate many people will voluntarily report and pay taxes on goods purchased over the Internet.
Another reason for supporting the tax on services is that the Wyoming economy is shifting away from the production and consumption of goods to an economy that is dominated by the delivery and consumption of services.
"Our economy is not goods-based, it's services-based."
Our tax system should reflect our economy.
"In order to reduce the regressiveness of either kind of sales tax, I recommend that the sale of certain food products not be taxed."
Other revenue measures I recommend the repeal of the 1999 Oil Recovery Act for severance taxes on oil and sales tax on electricity used to produce the oil.
"Part of this proposal would be moot, since the market price trigger has caused the reinstatement of the severance tax break."
"However, the sales tax exemption should be removed."
I recommend that you amend the 1993 act that grants incentives for new production of natural gas.
"When that incentive for new gas production was enacted, no one anticipated the boom in coal bed methane, or shallow gas wells."
"Since the reason for the incentive was to allow for earlier recovery of the high cost of deep gas wells, I recommend that shallow gas wells not be given the incentive."
Few if any of the operators were even aware of the tax break until recent news articles on the tax incentives were circulated.
I support the removal of the sales tax exemption currently allowed for fuel consumed by railroads and pipelines in Wyoming.
We are focused on fairness and the broadening of the tax base.
The current exemption does not apply to any other segment of the economy.
I support removing the sunset on the collection of fuel taxes to offset the diversion of severance taxes away from transportation programs.
The tax was due to expire once $20M had been raised.
The effect of removing the sunset would be to continue to impose a two cents per gallon tax on the consumption of all fuel in Wyoming with no exemptions.
"Phase in the Education Tax Since we are going down a path that is somewhat uncertain, I recommend that whichever education taxes be enacted that they be phased in over the next two years to allow us to adapt to changing situations."
Limit the Growth of Government: No Net New Programs We must remind our successors and ourselves that the growth in government services and the resultant cost doesn't fall in large increments.
"It occurs slowly, in small doses, over time."
I support the enactment of a law that would prohibit any net increase in state programs.
"By doing so, the Legislature would have to vote to eliminate one program for every new program proposed."
Governor's Flexibility to transfer spending authority The Governor's flex has generated a fair amount of discussion.
"In fact, it could and should be used to curb the steady increase in the delivery of services."
"Properly crafted, the authority would be limited to enhancing efficiency by transferring excess funds from one program to a shortage in another area."
Good management principles dictate such a prerogative.
"Without Flex, agencies that have a surplus would have the incentive to spend up to their authority, thereby encouraging waste."
Agencies that must live with deficiencies would be penalized for good management.
"One way or another, I urge you to change the budget statutes to allow Flex."
"Without it, you will perpetuate the incentive to waste funds."
Recommendation: Reinstate the Flex provision to minimize waste.
"On-Line Government: e-commerce for state services Last year, you passed a bill authorizing the five elected officials to adopt rules to allow the delivery of services through technology and through on-line or Internet based activity."
The law you enacted is one of the most progressive in America and has attracted considerable attention for the innovation it could encourage.
I propose that you allow the On-line Government Commission to use a portion of the unused funds that were originally allocated to fix Y2K bugs as a beginning step to implement on-line or e-commerce for state services.
The potential for citizen satisfaction and dollar savings is significant.
But it requires an up-front investment.
We were very strict about allocating only the most needed funds for Y2K repairs.
"We saved over $5M that to date do not appear on your Goldenrod paper, the Fiscal Profile."
Recommendation: Authorize the use of Y2K funds for On-Line Government.
"Your state agencies have identified 53 separate services that could be enabled on-line; that is, any citizen needing service that today is provided through a person could access that service through a personal home computer or a terminal in a public setting such as the local library."
"Renewals of drivers' licenses, applications for forms, payment of taxes, bidding at auction for mineral leases, records management for health and family services, filing of regulatory compliance documents and access to public documents would be just a few of the possibilities."
"Issues such as access, privacy of information, design of an Internet portal, and training of personnel are areas of concern that need to be ironed out."
The state has already issued a request for proposal for the design concept for the on-line government project.
Your participation and oversight would be welcome as we implement one of the most innovative programs to date.
"One-Stop Service With the leadership of the Department of Employment, other state agencies including Health, Family Services, Education and Corrections are developing a system to allow clients to receive services from the appropriate agency or office within an agency regardless of where they make initial contact."
"When implemented, this concept would lead to a great demonstration of improved services for clients and would easily adapt to on-line services."
The frustrating telephone tag or the practice of passing a caller from one agency to another would be gone.
Customers would be served regardless of the point of entry to state services.
"Work First In addition, you will be asked to create a steering committee that will recommend a plan for the next legislative session to reduce duplicative efforts and fully integrate, coordinate and simplify the assistance programs."
We must shift our emphasis from entitlements to self-sufficiency through Work First.
Employee Work Flexibility and Performance Management I attracted a lot of attention and comment when I suggested that the state consider a four-day workweek.
My comments are based on two reasons which are quite different in context and application.
My primary reason for suggesting legislation to allow work schedule flexibility is to give employees more discretion over their lives.
Incentives such as this can enhance morale and allow working couples to adjust their work schedules to be more compatible with family needs.
Agencies could schedule four ten-hour workdays per week or even allow for other options under the proposed bill.
"I expect that worker productivity could see a considerable increase, benefiting the state and the people we serve."
Recommendation: I strongly support this legislative change.
My other reason for suggesting the four-day week was linked to the proposed cut in Support Services funding recommended to you by the JAC.
"The 200-series cuts, as they are known, would target technology, equipment replacement, in-state travel and payment of utilities."
"After reviewing the current laws governing budgetary allocations, I found that it would be very difficult to accommodate the cuts in any situation, but that we could save on the utility bills if we could shut down whole buildings at least one day a week."
"While there would be no savings in personnel costs, we could save on utility and telephone costs."
"I don't support this as a viable alternative to our budget problems, but suggest it as one of few alternatives to cut ever-increasing utility and communications costs."
Recommendation: Agency directors should be given added discretion to employ senior management on an at-will basis.
Salary and Benefits Nearly every employer in the state is experiencing shortages in being able to hire qualified workers.
That's true of both public and private employers.The State is no exception.
We are experiencing more personnel losses for longer periods than ever before.
"In the long run, it's far cheaper to enhance salaries and benefits than to recruit and retrain a valued employee."
"For the sake of stability and quality in the state workforce, I ask you to reinstate the salary increases that I proposed in my long-term budget."
The total amount that I requested averaged only 2% increase per year.
"The amounts to various employee classifications would vary, depending on the competitiveness of the market place."
Recommendation: Provide for salary increases as requested in my budget.
Support increased funding to cover the additional increases in health insurance premiums for state employees.
Closing You have joined with me and the state executive branch over the past year as a team dedicated to improving services to the people of Wyoming.
I thank you for your hard work and commitment to doing the right thing.
We reconciled our differences to come up with a plan.
We need to keep that same spirit of cooperation in order to work together effectively throughout this session.
Much has been said about a Special Session and whether it might be needed.
I pledge to you that I would call a special session only when we mutually agree that one would be needed and productive.
"Over the past five years, I have instituted several practices aimed at building bridges and fostering consensus."
"Each spring, I sponsor what is known as the Governor's Kitchen Table, a gathering of all the federal and state managers of our natural resources."
The format is informal and relies on the trust and cooperation needed to resolve some very difficult issues.
"The Kitchen Table comes from the idea that in Wyoming, people congregate where they are most at ease with each other."
"Just think of the many times you've gone to a friend's house or a family member's house for a dinner, a party or just a gathering."
"More likely than not, the most fun is when you gather in the kitchen."
"We want to capture that sense of security and trust in all that we do and reinforce the notion that while we don't have to agree on everything, we should agree not to be disagreeable."
The Kitchen Table conference is just one of several processes we have implemented in the state to encourage people to work out their differences and pull together for the common good.
"I ask that each of you here today or who have joined us by radio, TV, Internet, or who will read the account of this message in print, to set aside differences and respond with renewed energy and commitment."
The heart of our democratic form of government relies on building relationships and resolving differences through reconciliation.
We must reject the national trend that relies on intimidation and disrespect to gain personal advantage.We must build partnerships.
"When we talk more to each other and less about each other, we create working environments that support creative thinking for problem solving."
Thank you for your hard work in helping us build a long-term solution for Wyoming.
"I am reminded that our actions will speak louder than any of my words so, let's get to work!"
