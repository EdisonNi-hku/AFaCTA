sentences
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished elected officials, justices of the Idaho Supreme Court and judges of the Idaho Court of Appeals, ladies and gentlemen of the First Session of the 55th Idaho Legislature, fellow Idahoans: Let me again state how honored I am to be here today, as your Governor.
I am humbled by the faith placed in me by the people of Idaho and very grateful to all of those who worked on my behalf and believed in our vision for Idaho.
And I’d like to acknowledge one person in particular who has been by my side every step of the way, and whose love and support has been instrumental in my public service… my best friend and wife Patricia.
Thank you!
I believe in an Idaho where we raise healthy, well-educated children, enjoy streets safe from drugs and crime, benefit from clean air, clean water and an economic environment where business thrives, where good jobs are plentiful and our goods and services are sold world wide.
I am bullish about the State of our State, but I have concerns about recent economic indicators.
It should come as no surprise to anyone that this will be a tight budget.
After nine years of a bustling economy in Idaho, we now see nearly every agricultural commodity in the tank.
There is hardly anyone, except perhaps those in the dairy industry, who had a good year.
We are a natural resource-based state, and yet federal rules, regulations and moratoriums are making it difficult to harvest from federal lands.
The mining industry continues to suffer from depressed markets, and we are seeing layoffs and even closures at mining operations.
Market conditions have forced some of our solid and stable corporations, such as Boise Cascade Corporation, to announce a reduction in force.
Our corporate community has moved toward diversification of our economy.
Micron Technology, with the recent acquisition of Texas Instruments, is well positioned.
They’re now the only manufacturer of computer memory chips in the United States.
But they, like many companies, are suffering from the Asian flu, which has made it difficult for Idaho to sell products in the world market.
One of the great corporate sponsors of many great events and programs in Idaho – Ore-Ida -- is being called back to their parent company – the Heinz Corporation.
But there are bright spots.
Albertson’s – with recent acquisitions – is now the second largest grocery chain in the country.
Morrison-Knudsen is securing contracts and work all around the world, and bouncing back.
U. S. West is opening new call centers… Coldwater Creek is expanding operations… Melaluca, Hagadone Hospitality in Coeur d’Alene… the Holding Company in Sun Valley… the J. R. Simplot Corporation….
are all examples of Idaho’s economic vibrancy and potential at work.
I am an optimist, and while the State of our State is not as well as I would like to report to you, there is not a single one of the obstacles facing us that is insurmountable if we harness the spirit of this remarkable state, work together, and simply no longer accept anything but success.
During the campaign, I said we would face facts and find answers; keep what is right, and reform what is not.
So, let’s take a look at the situation in a number of areas: With regard to early childhood, we rank near the bottom nationally in early childhood immunizations.
Governor Batt began efforts to address that, and we’re making progress.
But it is time to step up those efforts.
Our child abuse rate, no matter whose numbers or reporting methods you use, is unacceptable.
If we say we will face the facts and find the answers, what are the answers to these difficult early childhood questions.
Here are my answers: I am recommending to the Legislature the establishment of an aggressive early childhood development and immunization program.
There are excellent programs already in existence.
"I want to pursue establishing – statewide -- a program that is modeled after ""Parents as Teachers."
This positive program, that will be strictly voluntary, affirms to parents that they are their children’s first and best teachers.
And it, through a strong public awareness and education program, helps parents better understand the scientific data that exists on how we can all improve our skills in the area of parenting.
Many states that have implemented this approach have also found a significant drop in child abuse -- which they attribute to this sort of voluntary effort, and public awareness.
With regard to immunization, the resources are there –including many people who are anxious and ready to help.
I was in northern Idaho meeting with a group of business and medical professionals, and after we discussed this problem, their response was overwhelming.
"They said, ""Tell us what you need."
But we have yet to establish a cohesive, concentrated, efficient system, complete with computerization links that ties the health districts in with the medical and business community.
The early childhood development and immunization efforts in my budget will total more than 2.5 million dollars.
Three fourths of that money will be earmarked for early childhood development, with the rest going toward immunizations.
Creating a statewide immunization registry is a critical first step to improving our immunization rates.
I am recommending we spend -- 98 thousand dollars – to create that registry and finally link our computers together.
And having the proper vaccines on hand is critical.
I am recommending we increase chicken pox vaccine funding -- giving us a total of 727 thousand dollars from all funds for chicken pox vaccines.
Now, I am serious about this and I want results.
I do not want Idaho lingering near the bottom in immunizations any longer.
We are in the 70th percentile now, and I want us in the 90th percentile in just two years.
And, I want to see many other measurements moving in the same positive direction.
In order to accomplish this, I will take the following steps: I am determined to designate an individual to head up this effort and drive it.
But that person will also coordinate with all the different groups working on immunizations.
This person will report directly to me.
That is my commitment to this program.
I am putting my own reputation on the line for achieving these positive results.
And therefore, one of the key decisions was, who to put in charge of it.
The individual whom I have chosen is an individual whose entire career is synonymous with success; an individual who, when you say the name, you think of results; an individual who shares my commitment to children; an individual who knows the value of immunization, because, as a child, was a victim of polio; and someone who knows how to take business principles -- with a thorough understanding of government -- and with the backing of a Governor, knows how to cut through the red tape.
So I’m pleased to announce today that the individual who will head this effort and bring about the results on early childhood development and immunizations is: Jim Hawkins.
The well being of our children must not stop here, we must not leave gaps, and therefore my budget recommendation includes full funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (C. H. I. P. s) to help provide health insurance for families who cannot afford it.
We must focus our efforts from birth to age four in a child’s life.
This is not only the right thing to do for our children, but from an economic standpoint, the right thing to do for all of us.
We must continue our focus on children as they reach school age.
Reading is the most basic and most important skill for the education of our children and is my highest priority for our public schools.
Therefore, I have identified the funds for a comprehensive reading program aimed at grades one, two, and three in the total amount of 5.5 million dollars.
I want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of the Legislative Interim Committee on Reading and the work they have done.
Their recommendations must be a part of what you and I, -- in corroboration with the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction -- determine the final product will look like.
But the funds are identified and that $5.5 million is to be utilized, and we are to get on with this, so that all children by third grade will be reading at grade level, and no one, I repeat, no one is left behind.
And, again based upon my personal commitment to education, but also recognizing the commitment of this Legislature that provides over 70 percent of our budget to education, I have selected a great educator, whom many of you have spoken highly of to me, and that is Tom Morley as my education advisor.
With that kind of expertise in the executive branch, combined with the commitment to education in the Legislative branch, and the dedication of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Marilyn Howard, whose background and career has focused on reading, this all bodes well for our kids.
But we all have to be working together.
If you can’t read by third grade, how can you be successful in the rest of your career in school.
You can’t.
So this is a priority.
Also, you will see in my budget that I have placed financial incentives for schools and teachers to push and achieve greater and greater things.
I have acknowledged that teaching is a calling.
"To some, when you suggest a financial incentive, they would say, ""That’s their job."
That’s what they’re supposed to be doing.
I appreciate that.
But I also believe in the principles of good competition and reward.
So, I’m recommending good financial incentives for those teachers and schools that become the models of successful reading programs.
I will also recommend financial incentives for teachers who attain national certification.
Once again, let’s face the facts.
So what are the facts about school facilities in Idaho?
I think everyone has heard that we have a 700 million dollar backlog in school facilities.
"My question is: ""Is that a fact?"""
That study was commissioned in 1991, completed in 1993, and is now six-years old.
And during those six years, local patrons have passed over 600 million dollars in bond issues.
But I don’t hear that fact when we discuss school facilities backlog.
Now, I will not suggest to you that the fact is that you can subtract 600 million from 700 million and have only a 100 million dollar backlog -- because during the course of those six years, further deterioration has, indeed, occurred.
So what is the fact?
The fact is, it is time to update the facilities assessment so that you and I both know what the backlog really is.
And so we no longer have advocates of all sides beating one another over the head with rhetoric.
We will face facts, but we must have the facts.
And so, I am calling for an updated, thorough, and accurate assessment.
I will recommend 200 thousand dollars from the General Fund to pay for this assessment so we can get on with addressing the facilities needs for our children.
After having said this, you and I both know that there are school districts that are absolutely hurting.
We can actually name some of the schools where the kids don’t have adequate facilities.
There are parts of this state where the unemployment rate is not good, and those economic hardships manifest themselves in the quality of the school facilities.
And without quality schools, it’s hard to attract new businesses to turn the economy around.
So, I’m not going to wait until the new assessment is complete before we move out to address those schools that truly need help.
The people have already responded positively to a legislative initiative that Senator John Sandy proposed last year of allowing local school districts to utilize the bond rating of the state to lower interest payments.
This is a significant help to the local districts.
But, having talked just a moment ago about incentives, I also believe in providing incentives for school districts that are legitimately in need of help.
"I propose that in school districts that the State defines as ""economically depressed,"" the State can step in and help in the actual payment of the interest on the bond."
School districts that demonstrate the need would then be eligible for that assistance.
But please note a very important distinction here.
I am proposing that we help on interest payments – not on principle.
Not on brick or mortar.
It is my conviction that once the State begins any effort on a brick and mortar campaign for schools, it will never stop.
It becomes a new state entitlement, with the adverse consequence that the local schools will begin losing their authority and control.
I don’t want to see the State -- five or ten years from now -- with tight budgets, saying that as we continue our state school building program, in order to stay within the budget, we must now use a cookie cutter approach.
One size fits all.
And for economic reasons, one result might be that we consolidate and build one large school for two small communities.
It is ironic that in major urban centers back East, they are now realizing that with the tremendous problems they are experiencing in their large high schools, they are now creating smaller high schools within their large schools to fix their problems.
We already have small schools.
Don’t start down the path of consolidating them.
In that regard, we are ahead of the game.
It is also my opinion that we already have, in state statute, the language to allow us to help on bond interest payments for depressed school districts.
I look forward to working with you to bring that about and fund it.
Now, it would be far easier, and even more politically safe, for me to move on to the next topic and not discuss the 67 percent supermajority required for passage of school bonds.
But that’s not how I operate.
Some of you have told me -- flat out -- you don’t support changing the 67 percent.
What I ask of you is to simply hear me out, and keep an open mind.
My proposal is to simply allow the school districts at the local level to decide whether they would utilize a 67 percent supermajority or a 60 percent supermajority.
If, in fact, the 60 percent were to be utilized by the local school district, they would no longer be able to determine the special election date.
It would be held either during the primary or general election.
I believe as I’ve discussed this with some of the members of the agriculture community, they see some wisdom and benefit in knowing that a school bond will take place on one of two dates – one of two specified dates during the year – instead of a special election that may find them working in the fields.
A special election, by its very nature, is geared to minimize voter participation.
If, in fact, we believe in democracy, then lets encourage greater voter participation.
I would prefer to see a school bond election determined by 2000 voters rather than 200 voters.
Because this is a constitutional question that must be decided by the people, all I’m asking you to do is to allow the people the opportunity to decide, once and for all.
A vote by the Legislature to put this on the ballot is NOT a vote to raise property taxes.
You don’t have that within your power.
Your vote is simply to place this constitutional question before the people on whether they want both a 67 and 60 percent supermajority with the requirements that I’ve outlined.
Again, let me make it very clear.
I am not asking you to raise property taxes.
As a member of the United States Senate, I never voted for a tax increase, and the budget I will submit to you does not contain a tax increase.
This is simply an effort to provide school districts with the right tools in the tool box so that they can make a local decision to provide adequate facilities.
So, therefore, let’s let the people who showed the good wisdom to send us here, have the same opportunity to exercise their wisdom on this issue.
This is not an initiative issue.
It is a constitutional issue.
Because it deals with a priority of this Executive and Legislative branch, which is education; because it brings into focus, local control; because it provides options; this issue legitimately should be placed before the Idaho voter.
And I would respectfully and humbly suggest that a unanimous vote would be appropriate -- so that no one is needlessly hung out politically on this.
Let us not forget there is a high correlation between healthy well-adjusted young children and their performance in school.
There is a correlation between high school graduation and a decrease in incarceration.
And a correlation between high school graduation and higher lifetime earnings.
So you see, there is a correlation between how we start our children on the path of life, and the quality of all our lives.
It may increase the cost of government some in the short term, but it will greatly reduce the cost of government and the human costs of incarceration in the long term.
With regard to incarceration, let me first commend Governor Batt on his efforts of reforming sentencing guidelines.
We have seen a tremendous growth in one of the unfortunate growth industries of Idaho, and that is our prison population.
And for a society to be safe, those people that cannot behave; that prey upon other people; that would take the lives of other people, there must be facilities.
There must be prisons to house them.
Idaho is in the position of having a new prison facility that can open as determined by this Legislature and Governor.
Therefore, we are not faced with the unenviable situation of having to turn out criminals that should be in prison because of overcrowding problems.
That is not the case today.
Specifically with respect to the new 1250 bed prison, I do not recommend opening the prison in FY 2000.
We have the capacity.
I do not feel the current prison population would justify that.
And, since Idaho has successfully managed its inmate population, including the issue of double bunking, I would not support moving prisoners into a single bunk situation just so we can say we have full utilization of the new prison.
Because once you cross that rubicon, once you step back, you will once again face a court challenge to have the authority for double bunking.
Prisons are built for the protection of the law abiding citizenry who pay the taxes.
They are not built for the well being and comfort of the criminal.
There is a group of individuals that I am intent upon incarcerating, and those are the methamphetamine producers and dealers.
My multi-faceted plan of action for dealing with these peddlers of poison -- who have no regard for the well-being of our citizens, including our children -- is the following: I will work to implement a coordinated, seamless approach to fighting methamphetamines.
We will bring the resources of the state to bear along with federal resources in a concerted effort with local law enforcement.
First, we will add six full-time positions to the Idaho Department of Law Enforcement – three Idaho State Police Troopers and three criminalists in the Bureau of Forensic Services.
The State Troopers will address the immediate need for additional enforcement to detect and seize clandestine labs and apprehend drug couriers who use our highways to transport illegal drugs.
The criminalists positions will reduce the existing back log of pending drug analysis, while providing timely turnaround of evidence in new prosecutions.
The forensics division will receive an additional crime trailer – making a total of three, statewide -- to be used in the safe clean-up and disposal of hazardous materials from clandestine lab seizures.
I also recommend $111 thousand dollars for advanced Idaho POST Academy training courses for both state and local officers in drug interdiction laws and policies, recognition of drug trafficking trends, and key characteristics and search and seizure techniques.
These courses will better prepare Idaho law enforcement to combat the increasingly sophisticated illegal drug network that is active in our state.
Importantly, I will recommend funds so that some of these courses may be presented in the different regions of the state – rather than at the POST Academy in Boise.
This will significantly reduce the training and travel costs for local law enforcement agencies.
And finally, to compliment the enhanced level of enforcement resources provided in my budget recommendations, I will ensure vigorous enforcement of seizure laws for property used in the manufacture and distribution of illegal drugs, and stiffer penalties for drug dealers who rob our citizens of the bright future they deserve.
If we are so successful in this effort that we do need new prison capacity, I’ll open the prison the next day -- if it means putting these dealers of poison away.
For just a moment, I want us to all think about the future of a child born this year.
The children born this year, 1999 – the last year of the second millennium – will come of majority age in the year 2020.
"As I said in my inaugural address, this truly is the ""Generation of the Child."
This is the millennium generation that we must nurture.
So, let’s follow this millennium generation – from birth to maturity.
Let them be our standard by which we, the leaders of today, measure our efforts for tomorrow.
We must have a dual-track approach.
In the long-term we will focus on early childhood development and immunizations to give our children a healthy, well-educated start.
And in the short term, we will address those obstacles, like methamphetamines, that stand in the way of a healthy and productive life.
And we must accomplish these desires within the scope of our means, and take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit and creative ideas of our people and our state employees.
Now, as we move forward, with efficient government, and tailored programs, we must be successful economically.
That is the engine that drives our ability to achieve our goals.
We must be competitive in the 21st Century -- both with other states and internationally -- in the areas of education, technology, and infrastructure, to name a few.
We are fortunate to have an entrepreneur as successful as Gary Mahn, agree to enter the public sector, with his talents and abilities, to move us forward.
We are also fortunate to have someone like Tom Arnold agree to take on the science and technology program, which will include an aggressive program to land the new space port in Idaho.
I will also submit to you legislation, calling for a resolution of support for the space port.
If national politics are put aside, Idaho is the logical choice, and eastern Idaho is well positioned to become America’s new gateway to space.
Also, I will soon name a science and technology advisor whose efforts will focus on this rapidly expanding segment of our economy.
If Idaho is to compete successfully in a world dominated by scientific and technological advances, then we, as state leaders, must have the best advice and breadth of vision available.
Not only will this person offer advice, but in order to move into the mainstream with states that are major players in science and technology advancement, this advisor will ensure that Idaho’s efforts are proactive and that our minimal resources are properly leveraged with those from the federal and private sectors.
And, with this advisor in place, we will have available to us through the National Science Foundation, monies that only can be used by states with an advisor and a science and technology council in place.
Lt. Governor Butch Otter has demonstrated time and time again that he is one of this state’s finest salesmen.
Now, while it’s recognized that a Governor of a State is its number one trade ambassador, with Butch’s proven track record, I don’t intend to redirect his talents elsewhere.
I intend to join him, and therefore, we will double the effort at national and international trade for Idaho.
We will be an effective team.
Our institutions of higher education will play a key role in economic development: 1) Through research, and supplementing our sales and marketing, and, 2) in providing for the next generation work force.
Higher education, too, is a very competitive market.
If you want to retain or recruit the best professors in the highly competitive fields, you must be competitive.
I have included a recommendation for a one-time program with a total impact of $3 million dollars that will allow the universities to attract and retain faculty in these highly competitive areas.
If the universities are successful in recruiting new faculty and retaining professors in these highly competitive areas, then we will look to continue this program in future years.
But we must recognize that our universities have to be able to compete for quality faculty.
This also applies to our dedicated state employees.
Pat Takasugi, whom I have asked to continue leading the Department of Agriculture, said in his first report to me that it is getting more and more difficult to keep quality state employees.
"Here’s what his reports said about Information Technology (IT) recruitment and retention problems at the Department of Ag: ""We have a five person IT unit."
Only the manager has been with us for more than two years.
We have had four staff members go to more lucrative jobs in the private sector in the last two years.
The result is an 80% turnover in the past two years.
Again, we must recognize that it’s competitive out there.
I have requested that agencies use the savings from PERSI in FY 1999 to focus on attracting and retaining those in the technical skills area and provide improved training opportunities for all employees.
These state employees are one of Idaho’s great resources and one reason we are such a great state.
Let me mention, too, to state employees, my personal experience with people who work for the state: I believe I received a great education at the University of Idaho with dedicated instructors and professors, and all the experiences on campus, just as many Idahoans have at each of our state’s outstanding institutions.
While Student Body President there, I was once returning to Moscow after meeting with Members of the Legislature in Boise.
The car hit some ice and rolled over, many times landing on its roof.
Had it not been for the snow bank, we three students would have gone into the river.
And there’s no question in my mind what the end result of that would have been.
So I know something about transportation between here and north Idaho.
But as we crawled out of the car, the first person to arrive to help us was the driver of an Idaho Transportation Department snowplow.
His compassion, aid and warmth of the cab of that truck are still greatly appreciated.
Soon after that, an Idaho State Police officer arrived and took us to where we could get transportation back to Boise.
After graduation, my first job was in Moscow at the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology.
I was then transferred to Boise to the Department of Lands, and ironically, the office I used in that position as a new graduate from the University of Idaho, was the same office space that was assigned to me as Governor-Elect, some 23 years later.
It’s kind of like de ja vu all over again.
Just a few weeks ago -- as I had 23 years earlier -- I stood in the same office, anxious and ready to join you in serving the people of this great state.
At the Department of Lands, I could not have worked for a greater boss, or greater public servant than Gordon Trombly.
And what great co-workers I had.
I can still name them: Jack, Fred, Ed, Paul, Alan, Dave, Mary, Tilly, Ruby, Marlys, Jim and Freda – to name a few.
What wonderful, hard-working people.
We still have that same spirit in State government today, and I appreciate it.
And I have been very impressed by all the employees that I have met that currently work here.
Again, think of the irony.
Who would have ever thought that this U of I grad working for the Department of Lands would someday become the President of the Idaho Land Board.
But you know what?
I think Idaho has prepared me for it.
As a state employee, I once walked out on these beautiful grounds surrounding the Statehouse and stood under a tree planted by Teddy Roosevelt and asked Patricia to marry me.
I didn’t know at the time she’d become Idaho’s first lady.
If I’d have known that, I might have been too intimidated to propose.
I want each state employee to know, change is in the offing—change that is in their best interests and that of all Idaho.
This is only part of my commitment to identify areas where the State simply is not able to compete for quality people, and aggressively address those deficiencies.
We often hear people say you ought to run government like a business.
I don’t know of any Chief Executive Officer in corporate America who does not have control of their support staff and personnel office.
Therefore, as CEO of this state, I will ask the legislature to support putting the Department of Administration under the Governor’s office, and that includes the Personnel Commission.
We must never rest in our effort to make state government as lean and efficient as possible, and I will continue to look at re-engineering the way we deliver state services, so we are effective for the people, and that it’s good for the state employees.
Let me turn to another area that makes Idaho so special: our environment.
Idaho offers a unique quality of life.
We must not lose our clean air or clean water, our ability to hunt and fish, or the many other outdoor recreation possibilities that are so much a part of our life.
To lose these would be to lose our identity and our heritage.
In dealing with environmental issues, I know regulators often become focused on keeping people from doing the wrong thing, and forget to provide incentives for doing the right thing.
Well, that is not my style.
I intend to employ a new perspective; a new set of tools; a new approach to dealing with what have oftentimes been some of our most polarizing issues.
My approach to environmental issues is more collaboration and less confrontation.
Last year, Governor Batt came to you with a proposal to establish a Department of Environmental Quality.
He was doing the right thing in pointing out the need to establish a balance between economic growth and protection of human health and the environment.
Therefore, at the appropriate time, and with the appropriate consultation, I will move to elevate our environmental agency to Department status.
We can create this new relationship without creating new bureaucracy.
We can do this without creating an agency more concerned with punishment than service.
We can do this together and we can do it right.
But it will take a financial commitment to resolve some of these environmental issues.
In my budget, I ask that you appropriate $1,500,000 to the Soil Conservation Service to meet the demands for the implementation of total maximum daily load (TMDL) restrictions on Idaho’s listed waters.
In addition to my recommendation that the Division of Environmental Quality become a separate department of state government, I recommend that you provide additional funding of nearly a quarter of a million dollars to the department for the purpose of TMDL development and implementation and to enhance the operation of the state Bull Trout Plan.
April, 1999 is a key milestone for Idaho’s nuclear waste settlement agreement with the U. S. Department of Energy.
The first shipments of transuranic waste must begin leaving the site, or shipments of foreign fuel will stop.
I have spoken with Secretary Richardson of the Department of Energy, and he remains committed to meeting that timeline.
As Governor, I intend to fully enforce that agreement.
That means, that should the federal government not fulfill its commitment, then until those are met, I will allow no further shipments into Idaho.
The Settlement Agreement also requires the Department of Energy to grant $30 million to the state for economic development efforts.
Some of that money went to Idaho State University, Boise State, Eastern Idaho Technical College and the University of Idaho.
But so far, most of the funds have gone to the Regional Development Alliance in eastern Idaho.
As of August of last year, the last reporting period, they have awarded $9.3 million, and they project that money will create over 2000 jobs.
If RDA’s track record of success continues, nearly 6,000 people could eventually be employed in eastern Idaho as a direct result of Idaho’s historic nuclear waste settlement agreement.
The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is important to Idaho and to the country.
It is America’s environmental laboratory.
And, along with the Congressional delegation, I will continue to promote the INEEL for new missions.
I look forward to working with our Congressional delegation, not only on new missions for INEEL, but on a whole host of issues, because there is no finer delegation in the country than Larry Craig, Mike Crapo, Helen Chenoweth, and Mike Simpson.
We have an unprecedented opportunity to bring some long overdue harmony concerning salmon recovery.
I am as committed to restoring our historic salmon runs as anyone, and I will work with the other states in the region to aggressively find answers for restoring our fish.
But a solution for the return of Idaho’s salmon must include a concern for fish and people.
It cannot be based on policies that sacrifice Idaho water or destroy local communities.
Let’s lay the facts on the table – all the facts – and go forward in unison in doing what’s best for the fish and the people of Idaho and lay aside the ultimatum rhetoric that has so polarized our citizens.
That will get us no where.
And while we are speaking of water, let me reaffirm today our efforts to protect Idaho water from being controlled by the federal government.
Federal claims in the adjudication process, if granted in their entirety, or even partially granted, would return Idaho agricultural lands to the sagebrush desert of yesteryear.
Today, we put the federal government on notice that Idaho will not relinquish its sovereignty over its water resources.
I acknowledge your foresight and wisdom in establishing a Constitutional Defense Fund, and I won’t be shy about spending it and defending the Idaho Constitution, which we took an oath to uphold.
In our vigilance to protect Idaho’s water, I will recommend that the Legislature not act on the federal government’s request to extend authority to contract for 427,000 acre feet of Idaho water.
If we automatically extend that authority, then you can be sure that some of Idaho’s water will be automatically included in the federal government solution to saving salmon.
If, indeed, the science and the ’99 Decision Point indicate that the 427,000 acre feet is critical to the needs of salmon and steelhead, then we will still be able to act on that as one of the first issues of next year’s legislative session.
We must find a way to recreate the Idaho that Lewis and Clark wrote about in their journals, where the lands were rich with fish and game.
I look forward to working with you and the Department of Fish and Game to enhance opportunities for sportsmen.
I believe all of us are dedicated to supporting a strong fish and game program, however, I do not feel that a compelling case has been made to use General Fund money, and therefore, I do not include any general Fund dollars for the Fish and Game department.
Input from citizens will be very important in this process.
We must also deal with the explosive spread of noxious weeds across the lands of Idaho.
It is a major threat to the productivity and integrity of our forests, rangelands and croplands.
It is resulting in an estimated $300 million annual economic loss to Idahoans.
We will accelerate the work begun by Governor Batt and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture and continue to make stopping the spread of noxious weeds a high priority.
Good economies also rely on quality transportation systems.
As a United States Senator, I was fortunate to be in a position to help Idaho get the fourth largest increase in highway funds under the new six-year transportation bill.
Idaho went from $125 million to $202 million annually for the next six years.
And with almost a half a billion additional dollars coming to Idaho, many critical safety projects will be addressed over the next six years.
At the same time, those federal dollars will serve as an infusion of cash into our economy, creating hundreds of new jobs across the state.
For businesses to thrive, we must also improve our telecommunications infrastructure, providing better fiber optic links across the state critical to the new technology of the coming age.
I want to make sure that this state is linked together electronically.
As I said on Friday, North, South, and East Idaho are compass points.
We are one state, and we need the infrastructure in place to bring us together.
I don’t want to lose out on new jobs relocating to Idaho because the infrastructure was not in place -- whether it’s highways or fiber optic cable.
And speaking of locations, with the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City both taking place after the turn of the century, we must continue to prepare ourselves for a dramatic increase in the level of tourism in our state.
I want to commend the Department of Commerce’s existing Program and Executive Committee that is already in place for doing just that.
While the eyes of the world will be on our neighboring state, plenty of people will also experience the splendor of Idaho.
Unfortunately, our image is not without blemish.
Together, we must effectively promote the real image of Idaho and Idahoans.
We are one state, and it is a rich colorful heritage and the colors of black, white, brown, red, and yellow only enhance the richness of our society.
We do not have room in this state for bigotry, intolerance and hate.
We cannot let a small group of malcontents dictate how the rest of the world views the Gem State.
Whether it’s government or individuals, I believe in accountability and responsibility.
One of the reasons I went to Congress was to make Congress accountable for the laws it passed.
Because of unfunded federal mandates, 17 percent of my budget as a mayor went right off the top to pay for Congress’ priorities.
We enacted a law that ended unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments.
That same philosophy should apply at the state level.
If there is a program that we require local governments to implement, then we ought to pay for it.
While I am mindful of the fact, and acknowledge, that the State already provides significant funding for local programs, there is a principle involved here: If you're going to pass the bills, you better pass the bucks.
Mr. Speaker and Pro-Tem, I would be proud if you would send me the equivalent of my Senate Bill 1 that would do just that.
That happens to be good public policy.
Let’s turn our attention to bad public policy – the marriage tax penalty.
Can anybody justify it?
If we believe in family; if we believe the family is the fabric of society, and marriage is the institution of the family, why do we have policy that penalizes it?
As you’ll see in my budget recommendation, I make the first down payment on eliminating the marriage tax penalty.
Too often the focus is on putting new laws on the books.
Here’s a real opportunity to take a bad law off the books.
We need to create new and strengthen existing partnerships.
I want to be a partner with you.
I have the utmost respect for each of you here in the Legislature.
While serving at the federal level, I would often reference what the Idaho Legislature had accomplished.
I intend to work with you to continue that reputation of Idaho being a place where the rest of the nation can find answers and innovations.
I will be the first to tell you I don’t have all the answers.
But I think I’m a pretty good listener.
I believe we’re going to have a great relationship that will achieve the results that the folks who employ all of us seek.
It has been my experience that if you’re willing to listen to one another and work together, you’ll find the solution to any challenge.
As we prepare to enter a new millennium, we stand today on the edge of a new frontier, a frontier of unknown opportunities - a frontier of unrealized dreams.
Realizing the potential of Idaho’s future will prove to be a journey, not a destination.
Last Friday, following the inauguration, Patricia and I stood in my office for over four hours and greeted close to 15-hundred people.
I was so impressed and overwhelmed that citizens were willing to stand in such a long line to shake hands.
I don’t know of a better indoctrination for a new governor than in a period of four hours to greet 15-hundred constituents; to get a better perspective from the people you work for… to look them in the eye… and to listen to their hopes, aspirations, and concerns.
It truly was a meaningful afternoon, because these Idahoans inspire me.
They are true believers in the future of Idaho.
They are realists, and I count myself as one of this company, and I believe you are too.
I can think of no greater state, no greater people to serve, and no greater honor than to take this state into the 21st Century, into the Third Millennium.
Ronald Reagan governed in the belief that it’s amazing how much you can get done if you don’t care who gets the credit.
I agree with that.
We’re going to do many great things together.
There will be plenty of credit to go around.
That’s how it should be.
Thank you very much.
