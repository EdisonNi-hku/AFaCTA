SENTENCES
I am pleased to join you today to deliver my fifth state of the state address to members of the General Assembly and the people of Delaware.
I don't know that these speeches have gotten any better over time.
"Martha says they've gotten a little longer every year, and she reminded me just this morning of the old adage that no sinners are saved after the first thirty minutes of a sermon."
"Well, whether or not the speeches have improved, one thing we can say for certain is that the state of our state has improved on many fronts."
"Just as we did over 200 years ago, we're achieving things today that in the past seemed impossible."
We're living up to our proud history as the First State by leading America into the 21st Century.
Our economy is as strong as an oak.
1998 finds Delaware with perhaps the lowest unemployment rate on the East Coast -- 3 percent.
The 49th smallest state was number four in job creation over the past 12 months.
"Almost 400,000 people will go to work in Delaware today."
"Over 50,000 new jobs have been created since 1993 alone."
Robust economic growth has fostered equally robust revenue growth.Our budget remains balanced.
We continue to spend less than 98 percent of available revenue.Our Rainy Day Fund is full.
"We have cut taxes for the last five years -- business or personal, and sometimes both -- and we are poised to cut them again, hopefully, this month."
"To top it off, Delaware enjoys the highest credit rating in our history."
"To keep our economy growing in the next century, we've launched the most comprehensive statewide education reforms in America."
We have established world-class academic standards.
"This May, students in grades 3,5,8 and 10 will take new tests to measure their progress in reaching the rigorous standards we have set in math and English."
Last year's writing assessments showed improvement at every grade tested.
"To help continue that progress, every public school classroom will be wired for access to the information highway by this fall."
No other state can make this claim.
"Over 8,000 students now exercise public school choice, introducing a healthy dose of competition into our public schools."
"Additional charter schools will open in Delaware too, showing how shared decision-making can raise academic performance."
"We're leading the nation in other areas, as well."
"Less than three years after launching A Better Chance -- one of America's first statewide welfare reform initiatives -- our welfare rolls are down by over 25 percent, and the number of people on welfare who are working has grown by almost 200 percent."
"To fight crime, we are using the largest prison expansion in state history to create a new prison system with expanded drug treatment, education, and work programs to cut recidivism and reduce the crime rate."
We've added an extra 100 state troopers and invested heavily in better training and equipment to keep our streets safer.
"To protect our natural resources, we've purchased the land or development rights for over 30,000 acres of farmland and open space, and established conservation districts to protect over 100,000 additional acres."
"In the entire nation, tiny Delaware ranks second in agland preservation."
"Working with industry and environmentalists, we've cut toxic emissions into our air by 60 percent, and into our water by 90 percent, since 1988."
We've implemented an ambitious plan to protect our inland bays.
"Last year, I signed a landmark agreement with EPA to reduce water pollution even more dramatically over the next 10 years."
"And finally, more than 25 years after Governor Russ Peterson's historic Coastal Zone Act was enacted, a compromise has been reached for new rules to preserve our fragile coastline forever."
Delaware truly is leading America into the 21st Century.
Let me also say a word or two about everybody's favorite whipping boy -- DelDOT.
"While taking potshots from just about everyone, the folks at DelDOT also have managed in recent years to restore I-495 to a six-lane highway, convert Route 113 to a four-lane highway between Georgetown and Milford, and complete the expansion of Route 896 to the C&D canal, as well as projects like Rockland Road and Lancaster Pike."
"By the end of next year, State Route 1 -- the largest highway project in Delaware history -- will be completed except for a seven-mile stretch from Odessa to Smyrna."
"The Naamans Road expansion will be done, as will the Bridgeville bypass."
Scarborough Road and Churchman's Road will be nearing completion and the Puncheon Run Connector will be well underway.
Transit service has been introduced throughout Sussex County.
"A new train station has opened in Newark, with another near Churchman's Crossing in the works."
DART service has been expanded by 40 percent.
Buses now operate at night and on weekends.Imagine that!
"And, paratransit ridership for the disabled has jumped 55 percent since 1993."
"While I regret the inconvenience that transportation construction projects cause for travelers in Delaware, I don't apologize for our commitment to address transportation needs that were ignored for too long."
We are fixing the problems that remain at DelDOT.
We are even learning how to sell surplus property.
"And if we get your legislative help this month, when February begins, we will be better prepared to sell a lot of it."
"Health Care/Children's Health One of the great successes we can point to in the past year is implementation of the Diamond State Health Plan, our managed care program for people on Medicaid."
"The savings from moving into managed care have allowed us to expand coverage to over 12,000 previously uninsured Delawareans."
"In addition, our partnership with the Nemours Foundation has led to 10 pediatric health clinics serving over 20,000 children in low income areas across our state."
We are within reach of our goal to provide universal access to health insurance for every Delaware child.
"Today, I am proposing using new federal and state dollars to create the Diamond State Health Plan for Children -- to enable every uninsured child with a family income under 200 percent of poverty to obtain a high-quality, low-cost health care policy similar to the Diamond State Health Plan."
"There are over 10,500 children in Delaware in this income category who lack health insurance."
"I propose to offer coverage to all of them, increasing the percentage of our insured children to over 93 percent.We won't stop there."
"Partnering with employers, we won't stop until every Delaware child has affordable coverage."
"We also are proposing to open the Plan to uninsured children below 300 percent of poverty on a full premium basis, costing far less than anything on the open market."
"We hope the State's extension of coverage will give Nemours the financial ability to extend its services, too."
Let us make Delaware the first state in America to achieve the goal of universal health care access for every child!
"Now, wouldn't that be a wonderful legacy for all of us to leave to Delaware's children!"
"YOUTH SMOKING During my time as governor, another important part of our child heath care effort has been reducing tobacco use among children."
Tobacco use is still the number one health problem in Delaware.
"It kills more people than alcohol, accidents, suicide, homicide, AIDS, illegal drugs, and fires together."
We owe it to our children to establish policies and programs aimed at reducing tobacco use before it becomes a lifelong addiction.
"Over the past several years, we have taken significant steps to that end: eliminating the sale of single cigarettes; prohibiting free samples; and removing vending machines from locations accessible to teens."
The average age of smoking initiation is now 12 1/2 years.12 1/2!
"Faced with this sobering statistic, I support legislation to prevent teen tobacco use, encourage kids to stop smoking, and make sure smokers pay the cost of treating smoking-related diseases."
"A clear majority of Delawareans hope you will join me in supporting it, too."
Smoking now costs Delaware over $10 million annually in Medicaid expenses.
"During the last 10 years, the total cost has been about $71million."
"By increasing the excise tax by 25 cents, we can repay the Medicaid costs of past years and cover new costs in the future."
"At the same time, the new tax will help us provide health care coverage to thousands of additional Delawareans by offsetting the added cost of the Diamond State Health Plan for Children program."
"It will also allow us to create new education and prevention programs to stop teen smoking, help smokers end their addictions, and provide Delawareans with accurate health information about tobacco use."
CHILD WELFARE Concern over the welfare of our children doesn't end with health care and smoking.
"Last year at this time, we agonized over the tragic death of Bryan Martin."
We moved quickly to respond more effectively to child abuse victims: providing additional resources and enacting the landmark Child Abuse Prevention Act of 1997 to make clear that protecting children is this state's top priority.
"Now, we need to take the next steps to ensure the placement of children who are abused or neglected into safe, loving, and permanent homes."
"During the past five years, I have sought to strengthen families because I believe we need to do everything possible to support keeping families together."
"In that same vein, however, we need to strike the right balance between keeping families together and supporting the best interests of children who have been abused or neglected."
"On this point, let me be clear."
We will not return children to homes where we know their safety cannot be assured.
Neither will we leave children in foster care for years with no permanent home in sight.
Delaware law should allow our state to permanently remove children from the custody of abusive and neglectful families.I will propose such a law.
"Why should we return a child who has been abused or neglected to a home where a parent has been convicted of serious felonies against a child, or abandoned or sold a child?We should not!"
"In cases like these, we are far wiser to terminate parental rights than to return a child to an uncertain fate."
Let me hasten to add that these new laws cannot work unless we increase the number of safe placements for children who are abused and neglected.
"My wife Martha is spearheading an initiative to sign up more foster families so that when we do remove children, we can place them in a stable, loving environment."
We must also redouble our efforts to promote adoption so that children who are permanently removed from their homes will have new homes and new families.
President Clinton has challenged all states to double the number of adoptions by the year 2002.
I want Delaware to be one of the first states in the nation to reach that goal.
"NURSING HOMES At the other end of the age spectrum, we are addressing the health and welfare of another vulnerable population in our state this year: Delawareans in nursing homes."
I'm pleased with the changes our Department of Health and Social Services already is making to protect nursing home patients.
"We've begun conducting surprise inspections in nursing homes, and we are undertaking serious management reforms in an overburdened Ombudsman's office."
"We've also begun a comprehensive review of all nursing home regulations to identify cumbersome and weak rules, and to ensure that appropriate penalties are in place."
"In the weeks ahead, we will work with the General Assembly's nursing home task force to develop any additional legislation needed this year."
MEDICAID MANAGED LONG TERM CARE Safe nursing homes that deliver quality care are essential because Delaware and America face significant increases in demand for long-term care services for our elderly and disabled populations.Why?
"Because people over 80 are the fastest growing group of elderly; more people with disabilities are leading productive, satisfying lives with appropriate support; and, we baby boomers aren't exactly teenagers anymore."
"In the coming year, I will be working with consumers and providers to present the first elements of a Medicaid Long-Term Managed Care plan."
"Already, 30 percent of the Medicaid population is responsible for 60 percent of the costs, and that ratio is going to get worse."
"With your help, we can build on the success of the Diamond State Health Plan and be on the cutting edge of managed long-term health care -- not to control costs for that sake alone, but to guarantee that we provide quality long-term care to all elderly and disabled Delawareans who truly need it."
Fighting Crime Long-term health care is only one of the areas where states are seeing populations rise and costs skyrocket.
Delaware's Department of Correction is the fastest growing part of state government.
Our prison population has grown almost 40 percent just since Lt. Governor Minner and I took office.
We are in the middle of the largest prison expansion in our state's history.
"But our recidivism rate -- the percentage of inmates who once released, commit more crime and return to jail -- still stands at over 60 percent."
"If that trend continues, we may need to propose more new prisons before I leave office in three years."
Law enforcement agencies know that most crimes are committed by people who are already criminals.
Many have already done jail time.
"Rather than just build more prisons, we need to redouble our efforts to rebuild the people already inside of them."
That may well be the single most effective crime-fighting initiative we can pursue.
I want us to create a new prison system within the walls of the one we have built.
A prison system that punishes those who commit crimes against our citizens.
A prison system that is secure and protects the public safety.
But a prison system that also works with inmates so that when they are released -- as over 90 percent will be -- they will be far less likely to commit more crime.
"Here's how: First, we know that 80 percent of our prison population are serious drug abusers, and drug abuse plays a major role in repeat offenses."
"We have tough, discipline-based drug treatment programs -- Key and Crest -- with a proven track record of breaking this cycle."
Prisoners who complete our rigorous Key and Crest drug treatment regimen are 40 percent less likely to be rearrested.
"That means 40 percent fewer crimes committed, 40 percent fewer victims, and 40 percent fewer new prison beds needed."
"Last year, I announced our intent to make sure every inmate with a sentence of one year or more must complete this regimen."
"This year, I propose we finish the job by fully funding Key, Crest, and Aftercare -- creating a prison system that will demand of those prisoners the discipline and commitment that these programs require."
"By doing so, we will become the first state in the nation to implement fully such an aggressive substance abuse program."
"Second, we also know that quality, prison-based educational programs have proven to reduce recidivism by as much as 45 percent."
"Last year, we sought the help of our award winning vo-tech school districts to better manage educational programs in our prisons."
"In a few short weeks, I will announce a plan to transform prison education so that quality education is taking place in our prison system day and night."
"Third, I propose to expand significantly our prison industry programs -- in conjunction with vocational training -- so that inmates can apply the skills learned in class."
"These three initiatives: substance abuse treatment, vocational education, and work programs, will help stem the rising tide in our prisons and reduce crime on our streets."
Police also need our help in the fight against crime.
"Over the past five years, we've invested heavily in technology to give law enforcement the tools they need to do their jobs better."
"This spring, our new 800 MHz radio system will be fully operational in Kent and New Castle counties, with Sussex soon to follow."
We will have the first statewide system in America that allows direct communication among police anywhere in our state.
"In addition, mobile data terminals in police cars now give officers instant access to vast amounts of crime-fighting information."
"Video-phones link up prisons and courts, saving transportation costs while increasing public safety."
"Keeping our focus on technology, I want us to establish a statewide crime tracking system where crimes are immediately mapped and tracked so that all police departments statewide can have crime data on a real-time basis to better deploy their assets."
"With the State leading the way, I challenge Delaware's Police Chiefs to develop a plan by the end of March to implement such a system."
"Technology is opening the door to better coordination among state and local criminal justice agencies, too."
"The more our law enforcement agencies come together, the more powerful our crime fighting punch."
"We threw that punch last summer to help slow the rapid rise in shootings in Wilmington with Operation Safe Streets, a cooperative law enforcement effort between probation and parole officers from the Department of Correction and Youth Rehabilitative Services, the Delaware State Police, and the Wilmington Police."
"Most of the shooting suspects were convicted felons on probation, and most of the shootings were occurring in certain designated ""hot spots"" in the City."
"Operation Safe Streets targeted these areas and probationers for ""zero tolerance"" enforcement."
The effort resulted in over 400 arrests.
"Later, the New Castle County Police Department joined forces to further increase police presence in the City last summer."
The result of these initiatives has been a significant decrease in the rate of shootings and violence in the City.
"I intend to expand our success in Wilmington to ""hot spots"" for violent crime statewide."
My recommended budget will propose adding 35 additional probation officers.
"I want to use some of those officers, in coordination with local police, to crack down on probation violators who are causing a large part of our crime problem."
I also will recommend major reforms to our juvenile probation system.
That system was designed for a time when juvenile crime meant shoplifting and other non-violent crimes.
"Today, juvenile offenders carry weapons and commit serious offenses."
"I propose a ""zero tolerance"" policy for serious juvenile criminals with probation violators sent to a no-frills, military-style boot camp."
The Wilmington shootings also remind us yet again that one major contributor to the rise in violent crime is the easy access to guns by those prohibited from having them -- kids and convicted felons.
"In fact, over 90 percent of the suspects connected with the Wilmington shootings in 1996 had a prior violent felony arrest.The record is clear."
They didn't buy their guns at gun stores -- they bought them on the street.
Delaware is the only state in this region which does not require a criminal records check for the sale of used handguns.
"Last year, I proposed legislation to require record checks on the sale of all handguns -- new and used -- in Delaware."
Law enforcement needs this tool to stem the flow of illegal guns.
It is time we gave them that tool.
Planning and Infrastructure Investments Personal safety is never far from the everyday concerns of Delawareans and is critical to our quality of life.
"This past year, more than ever, we have been focused on another important quality of life issue: how we manage our land-use."
Last year's land-use summit reinforced the need for a comprehensive and coordinated growth management strategy.
We have made much progress since then.
Each county now has a comprehensive plan in place to help guide a sustainable growth management policy.
New Castle County in particular deserves special praise for their innovative and comprehensive approach.
"In conjunction with the local and county comprehensive plans, my Cabinet Committee on State Planning now has begun to develop a statewide growth strategy map to help direct state, county and local investments into areas we all agree should be designated for growth."
"In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order requiring the Cabinet Committee to present a formal Administration plan to help guide investment decisions and exercise the State's legal and regulatory authority to support and enhance the county plans."
"In addition, the legislative package introduced last year to continue the State's path forward to a responsible growth management strategy must still be addressed."
I fully support those bills and urge the General Assembly to act on them so that we can continue our progress.
"The state's strong economic growth, and the one-time revenues created by our victory in the Delaware v. NY lawsuit, provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to invest over $220 million in Delaware's future."
"We're introducing technology in to all classrooms, modernizing our Port, preserving aglands and open space, building water and wastewater treatment facilities, improving communities and their housing, and fostering high-tech job growth."
"Now, I've proposed a new $104 million infrastructure investment package that is focused on four objectives: (1) complement State and county land use goals by directing investment in existing communities and growth areas; (2) protect critical farmland and open space from sprawling development; (3) enhance Delaware's economic competitiveness and create quality jobs; and, (4) further the State's commitment to education technology for Delaware teachers and students."
"With most of these monies, I propose to create a Growth Management Fund to continue our investments in farmland preservation, open space, water and wastewater systems, and affordable housing."
"These investments, coupled with changes in the Agland Preservation Program, are critical tools in meeting state and county land-use objectives."
"In addition, I recommend that another $10 million be invested in the Port of Wilmington -- a Delaware asset that's created nearly 4,000 jobs and almost $400 million in revenues for our economy."
"To further revitalize Wilmington's rapidly-changing riverfront, I am proposing that an additional $10 million be invested next year."
"To speed up transportation projects, I propose the investment of at least another $6 million in all three counties."
"Finally, to help students learn, I recommended an additional $13 million to provide students and teachers with thousands of additional new computers in classroom -- and training in how to use them."
Education I've already asked the General Assembly to make many important investments in our schools these past five years.
Delawareans can be proud of the priority we've given to children and their education.
Only five states spend more per pupil than Delaware.
"In the past few years, we have created new funding streams for teacher professional development."
"Collectively, we now provide over $1,200 per teacher annually for continued training."
"In addition, we've increased funds available for classroom resources by nearly 25 percent and invested an additional $40 million for textbooks and education technology."
We are providing a continuum of parenting training statewide to enable parents to better prepare their youngsters for school and for productive lives.
We are working to give every four-year-old child in poverty the chance to attend Head Start.
We've funded disruption prevention programs for every Delaware public school to reduce classroom disruptions and help misbehaving students get back on the right track.
We've placed wellness centers in high schools to address the health and social problems which cause too many adolescents to drop out of school.
"This year, we're providing local school districts with over $7 million in funds so that one-third of the students at the K-6 level can receive roughly 20 days of additional instruction -- summer school, after-school tutoring and, in some cases, full-day kindergarten -- to better enable all kids to meet the rigorous academic standards we've established."
"We're recruiting 10,000 mentors, too, as tutors and positive role models for Delaware students."
"And Lt. Governor Minner, as chair of the Workforce Development Council, is spearheading efforts to ensure that when kids leave school, they make a smooth transition to work and that they are prepared for the jobs of the future."
"Delaware is putting its money where its mouth is on education.We deserve an ""A"" for effort."
"But, despite pockets of excellence and the heroic efforts of many educators, Delaware is not yet passing the educational competitiveness test."
"While our per pupil spending is sixth highest in the nation, our fourth-grade reading scores ranked 32nd on the last national reading assessment and our SAT scores lag our neighbors."
"Those grades are not acceptable to this governor, to this General Assembly, or to Delaware taxpayers.We can do better.We must do better.You know it, and I know it."
"That having been said, I am convinced that we are on the right path to improving student academic performance across the board if we stay the course on the reforms we've begun and adopt the accountability measures I outlined earlier this week."
"Our State is a nationally-recognized leader in the movement to raise standards and spell out what we expect kids to know and be able to do at different grade levels in English, math, science and social studies."
"Delaware's rigorous academic standards, largely developed by many of our best and brightest teachers, have been in the hands of Delaware's teachers and principals now for over two years."
Training continues to be provided to bring classroom instruction into line with those standards.
Tests in both English and math will be administered for the first time this spring to measure student progress toward meeting those standards.
"A year later, similar tests will be introduced in science and social studies, as well."
"Last year, I asked you to assign responsibility in the political arena for improved student performance to me and a new Secretary of Education.You did so."
Parental responsibility is receiving renewed emphasis too.
"Now, the challenge is to hold students, schools, and districts accountable for meeting the academic standards we've set."
"Last year, legislators took a giant step in that direction by requiring high school students in the class of 2002 to pass state tests in English and math before receiving a State of Delaware diploma."
The General Assembly recognized that this important reform was insufficient in itself.
That's why you asked for a complete accountability plan designed to motivate students and schools to perform better.
"Two days ago, Secretary Metts and I publicly unveiled that plan."
"This afternoon, let me revisit with you several of its major elements."
The heart of the plan is quite simple.
We call for an end to social promotion in the most important subject of all: reading.
"If children can't read at grade level, they can't read a grade level science or social studies textbook."
"If children leave the school system without reading skills, they can't succeed in the workplace of the 21st century."
Socially promoting students who can't read is a crime against children.
I am asking you today to help me stop it.
"But in ending social promotion, we must assure that students who need extra help are identified early and that resources are available to provide the extra help that is needed."
"Toward that goal, I am recommending an additional $3 million for extra instructional time for grades 7-12."
"Combined with current funding, this gives our schools $10 million annually for extra time -- enough to provide almost an extra month of instruction for one-third of all Delaware students in grades K-12."
"In addition, I want us to reduce class size in the core academic subjects."
"As I visit schools across our state, I hear a consistent plea from teachers and parents - - especially in September and October: we need to hire more teachers and hire them sooner."
"Currently, districts hire teachers based on the number of students they have on September 30, well after the school year already has started."
"As a result, many districts hire too late."
This inflates class sizes in September and October and makes it harder to hire the best new teachers as they graduate from college in the spring.
I propose to end this problem by guaranteeing school districts at least 100 percent of their previous year's funding.
This will allow our districts to compete early for the brightest new teachers and help keep class size down from day one each September.
"I also propose to hire more teachers by lowering the unit count to provide a teacher for every 15 students at the K-3 level, and a teacher for every 16.3 students at grades 4-12."
"I understand that school districts still will need to hire librarians and counselors from these funds but, coupled with new federal monies, these changes still translate into 180 new teachers - - or 360 new instructional aides - - in Delaware schools this fall."
Teachers and parents tell me kids learn better when they are in a class with a more reasonable number of students.
"With that in mind, in addition to asking for funds to hire more teachers, I support new requirements to keep class size down."
"I propose capping elementary class size in the core academic subjects at 22 students, and capping middle and high school classes in the core academic subjects at 28 students."
Reasonable class size in elementary school and core subjects should be among our highest priorities.
"Given the generous investments I have mentioned -- in professional development, early childhood education, discipline, classroom materials, technology, extra time, and class size -- we can expect to see significant improvement in student achievement in the years ahead."
"I believe we should recognize and reward schools which do well, and those that improve."
Our recently-released accountability plan proposes to do that by granting state accreditation and monetary bonuses to those schools.
"For schools which fail to show improvement over time, the school staff, local school boards, and parents are called upon to develop a plan for improvement."
"The State will not ""take over"" schools run by duly elected school boards, but we should deny them state accreditation unless their performance improves."
I want to point out that our accountability plan does not impose new burdens on Delaware's hard-working teacher corps.
It does not tie individual teacher compensation or evaluation to the assessment scores of their students.
"Instead, our plan rewards teamwork among a school's staff."
"It focuses on motivating students and parents, and on ensuring that school districts provide classroom teachers with the resources needed to get the job done."
It calls for increasing the number of teachers and guaranteeing that teachers are assigned to the schools that need them in order to keep class sizes reasonable.
"Finally, I propose that the State study a new salary schedule for teachers that will reward meaningful continuing education, increase incentives for teachers to pursue national teacher certification, provide more time for professional development, and help Delaware attract the brightest new teachers."
I invite the full involvement of the Delaware State Education Association so that the views of teachers are fully considered in this endeavor.
The education agenda I've outlined today is an ambitious one.
"It will challenge students, educators and parents alike."
It focuses on results -- on whether our students are meeting high standards of academic achievement.
"If we want the best for our children, and I know that we do, we must have the courage to demand results, end social promotion, and meet high standards."
"Succeeding in this endeavor, it will be the most important thing that we do as elected leaders in this state."
The choice is ours: to fall back or to lead America into the 21st century.
"Closing As we prepare for the challenges of that century, let us remain ever-mindful of Delaware's leadership role in an earlier century."
Some 210 years have passed since Delaware helped start this nation in a place not far from where we are gathered today.
"It was not just any nation that we started, either."
"As this ""American Century"" draws to a close, our nation's economy remains the strongest on earth."
Our workforce is once again the most productive on earth.
Our armed forces constitute the mightiest military force for justice on earth.
"Indeed, 210 years after our country's founding, America remains the longest-living experiment in democracy in the history of the world -- and that Constitution which Delaware first ratified all those years ago remains the one most emulated by the other nations of the world."
I stand before you today confident that the state which helped deliver a newborn nation 210 years ago can deliver on its commitment to ensuring that babies born today will grow up healthy and strong.
"I'm confident that the state which has built the strongest economy on the east coast can also build prisons that produce better people, not better criminals."
I'm confident that the state whose financial controls are among the best in America can work with local officials to control the sprawl that threatens our quality of life.
"And, I'm confident that the state which helped write the book on welfare reform can produce students able to read books, use computers, live lives free of abuse, and graduate from our schools fully prepared to meet the challenges that the world has to offer."
"If children are our hope for the future, then we are their hope for today."
"I know that I speak for all of us on this day when I pledge to these children, and to their parents and grandparents, our tireless efforts to ensure that their state -- our beloved Delaware -- will be remembered not only as the state that started a nation, but the one that helped to lead that nation into the 21st century and beyond."
