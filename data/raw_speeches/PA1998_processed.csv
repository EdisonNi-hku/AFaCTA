SENTENCES
"Two months ago, on a crisp, December morning -- Pennsylvania looked on as a helicopter lifted the statue from high atop our Capitol dome.Her name is ""Commonwealth."
"And for over 90 years, the elegant bronze lady stood watch over Pennsylvania -- a symbol of Pennsylvania's tradition, an enduring landmark for travelers."
Yet the years had taken their toll.
"Once a beacon, she had become a fading light."
"Worn by weather, tarnished by time -- our ""Commonwealth"" had lost her luster.Something had to be done."
"Our ""Commonwealth"" had to be restored.Not discarded.Not replaced.But restored."
For there was much in this old statue to build upon.A strong foundation.A long tradition.A quiet dignity.
"""Commonwealth"" needed to keep those things -- but she also needed to be revitalized for a new century and beyond."
"My friends, that's exactly what's going on in Pennsylvania."
"For too long, Pennsylvania lagged behind its neighbors."
"Pick a list and three years ago, we were at the bottom of it."
Our state was ranked 45th out of 50 in job creation.
We had the highest job-crushing taxes in America.
Our workers' comp rates were among the highest in the region.
"A new generation of brazen, violent juveniles terrorized our streets -- and mocked a system unwilling to stop them."
"Our public schools, once some of the best in the nation, seemed trapped in a bureaucratic maze."
The voices of parents and children were rarely heard and new ideas were routinely rejected.Something was wrong.
So we laid out a plan to build a New Pennsylvania.
And with your help -- we're on our way.
The New Pennsylvania leapfrogged all the way from 45th in job creation to 17th -- over 28 states -- in three years!
And we won't be satisfied until we're No.
We've cut those job-crushing taxes.
We reformed workers' compensation -- costs are down while benefits for injured workers are up.
"Now, juveniles who commit an adult crime do adult time."
"And we've established plain, tough, common-sense academic standards that you can use everyday -- to hold your kids -- and your schools -- accountable."
"Yes, we have much to be proud of.But we cannot be content."
We've restored Pennsylvania's promise.
But in today's demanding world -- it won't last if we choose to stand still.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this budget does not stand still."
This budget will take Pennsylvania to the doorstep of the 21st century.
This budget year ends six months before the year 2000 begins.
"No, it's not the first budget of the next century."
But it's the budget that gets us there.
This budget is about the future -- and the past.
It's about change that is timely -- and values that are timeless.
Responsibility is one such value.
And that's something we need to talk about today.
There's been a lot said about the budget surplus.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know we have a surplus for one reason -- spending is finally under control.
"In the 10 years prior to my administration, the average state budget grew by 5.4 percent."
Our three budgets have grown at half that rate.That's a fact.
And that's why we have a surplus.
"If we had spent the old way, the surplus today would be zero, the Rainy Day Fund would be very dry and we wouldn't have been able to cut taxes."
But we didn't spend the old way.That's how we've cut taxes.
That's why we have a record balance in the Rainy Day Fund.
That's why our bond rating is up.That's why we have a surplus.
"So, I believe this year represents a moment of truth for state government, a crossroads between the old way of doing business and the new."
Harrisburg's history is only too clear.
"In good times, a spending spree."
"Then, when the economy inevitably turns down, a tax increase -- at exactly the worst time."
That is one tradition we must change.
We cannot abandon the fiscal responsibility that got us here.
This budget takes advantage of our surplus -- responsibly.
I propose we give Pennsylvanians a tax cut of $128 million.
"And we will invest in key areas such as job-creation, education, crime prevention, agriculture, tourism, the arts, environmental protection and more help for older Pennsylvanians."
"Yes, we take advantage of the opportunities presented by the surplus -- but we do so responsibly."
"That's the way Pennsylvanians conduct their own affairs, and that's our duty as the entrusted stewards of their money."
Taxpayers don't send us their credit cards -- they send us their hard earned dollars.It's their money -- not ours.
Responsibility is one important Pennsylvania tradition.
A staunch belief in our families is another.
Pennsylvania's families must always be at the heart of what we do.
They're the reason we're all here in this room.
"Whether it's education, jobs or crime -- it all boils down to Pennsylvania's families.This budget puts them first."
We start with a $54 million income tax cut for working families.
These families are doing the right thing.They work hard.
They do all they can to make ends meet.
Government should do what it can to help them.
"Under my proposal -- a working family of 4 that makes $25,000 a year or less -- will pay zero state income tax.That's right.ZERO!"
"There are 42 states that have an income tax, and right now, not one can make that claim."
Let's make Pennsylvania the first!
"That family of 4 will save $700 a year -- $700 for a down payment on a car, or to start a family savings account."
Let's face it -- they need it more than we do.
"To further help our working families, we will make an additional $28 million investment in an unprecedented effort to provide health care to Pennsylvania's children."
$15 million of that will go to the first stage of my five-year commitment to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program.
"With this investment, and the new federal money it will leverage, we will help an additional 140,000 kids get the health care they need.140,000 more children!"
But there's even more we can do for our kids.
"We can make sure there are good jobs here when they grow up -- good jobs, right here in Pennsylvania."
And I believe we will find many of those jobs in technology.
Technology is the next great opportunity for Pennsylvania to create quality jobs and a better quality of life.
"High-tech jobs are high-paying jobs, family sustaining jobs."
"The average salary for a Pennsylvania high-tech worker is more than $42,000.$42,000!"
Those are the kinds of jobs we want!
"That's why we eliminated the computer sales tax, created a research and development tax credit, deregulated the electric utility industry and targeted many of our economic development strategies to attract technology-intensive jobs."
And it's already beginning to work.
"Pennsylvania now makes the Top 10 in biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, advanced materials production, technology-intensive agribusiness and environmental engineering."
"Top 10 is good -- but in Pennsylvania, we play to win."
So we've written a strategy to get to No.It's called Tech 21.
"Here's how this budget puts it to work: First, we call for an expansion of the net operating loss carry forward."
"This NOL expansion is critical to high-tech start-up companies, which invariably lose money in their early years."
"Right now, Pennsylvania has the most restrictive NOL in the nation."
"If we're serious about high-tech jobs, that has to change.We are serious."
And with your help -- it will change.
Our start up firms also need capital.
That's where our new Pennsylvania Catalyst Fund will step in.
"Over the next three years, I propose Pennsylvania contribute a total of $10 million to a $50 million technology venture capital fund -- money that will jump-start high-tech companies across the state."
"Taxpayers will get a good return on their investment, and Pennsylvanians will get good jobs."
"With Operation Magnet, we'll focus Pennsylvania's economic development tools to attract high-tech companies."
We'll concentrate our resources to boost our tech-ready workforce.
"We'll link Pennsylvania's research institutions to the outside world through an ""Emerging Tech Partnership"" program."
And we'll get the word out -- by marketing Pennsylvania to the high-tech community.
Pennsylvanians won't simply dream about the Silicon Valley -- we'll create our own Silicon Valleys right here.
"In fact, it's already happening."
You can find the New Pennsylvania in the most unlikely places.
Did you know we make computers in Pennsylvania?We do -- up in Tioga County.
"In Mansfield, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old entrepreneur started a small computer company in 1990."
"All he had was a dream, a drive to succeed, and the desire to do so right in his hometown."
"So, Michael Ulmer and his wife Gabrielle took that dream, worked hard everyday and thanks in part to the changes you and I have made in Pennsylvania, Kingdom Computers is one of the fastest growing technology companies in Pennsylvania!"
Michael and Gabrielle now employ 158 Pennsylvanians.
"And if predictions hold, they'll triple that number -- in just two years."
"***** You know, the Ulmer's story can happen in every corner of Pennsylvania."
We can keep our best and brightest young people -- if we help them fulfill their dreams in Pennsylvania.
But dreams aren't just for the young.
"The new economy holds promise for all Pennsylvanians, young and old, so long as they are willing to learn."
If technology is the heart of the new economy -- education is its lifeblood.
Life-long learning has become a necessity.
I've learned that the hard way.
"Across that hall, on my desk sits a computer."
It used to be a 60 pound paperweight.Not anymore.
"This past year, I've had some training, made time to practice.Now, I can surf the net.I can send email."
And I can use a mouse -- not with the same ease as my 11-year-old daughter -- but at least now when someone talks about a mouse -- I know they're not talking about Mickey.
Bottom line: In the new economy -- education is the work of a lifetime.
This budget makes an unprecedented commitment to Pennsylvania's workers -- and their life-long learning.
"With a $31 million new investment in job training, our workers will succeed and excel in the rapidly changing new economy."
But the best way to ensure that success -- is to inspire our children to be life-long learners from the very beginning.
"Capture their natural love of learning -- and nurture it, expand it."
Allow them to find the joy in discovery -- while they acquire the skills they'll need to compete in tomorrow's world.
That's the idea at the core of our ground breaking Link-to-Learn program.
This year we make the final installment on Link-to-Learn.
We will also expand it with an additional $5 million to provide technology for students in non-public schools.
"Two years ago, when we started this $132 million program, we said we wanted to bring the resources of the world to our classrooms.That's what we're doing.Kids are excited.Teachers are empowered.Schools are better for it."
Just ask the children at Sulzberger Middle School in West Philadelphia.
Thanks to Link-to-Learn and the University of Pennsylvania -- students at Sulzberger explore the world -- right from their classroom.
They use their computers to study environmental issues in their own community.
Sometimes the best lessons learned are those found in your own backyard -- or your neighbors' backyard.Or half a state away.Or half a world away.
That's the power of Link-to-Learn.
***** Let me give you another example of the power of technology in education.
"Next door, in the Reception Room -- 4 students are opening this chamber to the rest of the world."
"Millions of people can see and hear this address live over the Internet -- thanks to Khristen, Erin, Amanda and Tiffany -- from the West Branch School District in Clearfield County."
"It's called ""Webcasting"" -- and these students -- along with their classmates back at West Branch -- are doing it themselves!"
"These young Pennsylvanians are high school students -- 15, 16, 17 years old!"
Their abilities are expanding every day.
This is an extraordinary demonstration.
And Link-to-Learn made it happen.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please join me and give these young people a hand!"
Classrooms aren't the only places that could use the helping hand of technology.
Pennsylvania's libraries could as well.
We give it with a record funding increase -- $11 million.
"Most of it goes for technology -- technology that will improve service for library patrons, and save our libraries money at the same time."
Technology holds great promise for education -- but this budget doesn't forget the basics.
That's why today I propose an increase of more than $200 million for our local public schools.
The basic subsidy goes up by 3 ½ percent.
And we will set aside more money to reward performance -- more support for districts that improve.
"In higher education, we've increased funding by over $36 million."
"And we will make college more affordable for an additional 1,700 needy students with a $17.5 million increase in PHEAA grants."
"Yet, all the money in the world won't mean a thing if our attitudes, our ideas -- the way we approach learning -- remain the same."
That's why last year we enacted charter schools.
"And that's why we're about to adopt new, rigorous standards for our students -- and their teachers."
"In this budget, we give those teachers unprecedented support to help them teach those standards."
"This budget includes a high-tech training initiative to reach 35,000 Pennsylvania public school teachers."
And we will build upon the success of our acclaimed Governor's Schools.
Each summer they open their doors to Pennsylvania's best and brightest students.
"Now, they'll keep those same doors open for Pennsylvania's best and brightest teachers."
And to better ensure all Pennsylvania teachers are the best they can be -- let's require continued professional development that's based on a content rich curriculum-- and let's require recertification every five years.
Our commonwealth is blessed with thousands of teachers dedicated to our children.
I believe in the power and the importance of the job they do.
Let's make sure we help them do it.
But you have often heard me say -- the color of innovation is not always green.
"So, today I call upon the General Assembly to help Pennsylvania's parents and communities re-gain their rightful place in their children's education."
Send me a Parental Bill of Rights -- one that respects parents and their decisions on how to raise their children.
And while we're at it -- before you break for summer -- let's give parents and communities the choice to require school uniforms next fall.
"We all believe our children deserve a good education -- but they also deserve a good, safe place to grow up."
"On my first day in office, I called for a Special Session on Crime."
Out of it came over 40 crime fighting measures.
Crime now has consequence in Pennsylvania.
We've been tough on crime from the beginning -- but we've also worked hard to stop crime at its beginning.
We want to build communities where the streets are safe and people can prosper.Streets are safer.
Take a look at our Community Partnership for Safe Children -- that has empowered communities in 34 counties to prevent youth crime.People can prosper.
Just look at our Project for Community Building.
"Soon, its Community Development banks will revitalize neighborhoods across our state."
But this budget doesn't stop there.We can't stop there.
"One of the keys to safe, strong communities is to turn around our young people when they start down the path of crime."
So we will dedicate $5 million to a proven initiative -- intensive probation when juveniles first get in trouble.
Another key is to make sure our law-abiding citizens and our law-enforcement officers feel they're on the same side.
"Sadly, that's not the case in all our communities."
The Alliance for Community and Law Enforcement Relations was born out of a desire to ease these tensions -- and to rebuild the trust.
This budget will begin to implement their recommendations.
"Together, we will work to bridge the gap between police and the communities they are sworn to protect."
Yet there are some Pennsylvania communities that need our help in even more ways.
"Tragically, there are still places in Pennsylvania where the future looks bleak."
You know the places I'm talking about.Abandoned lots.Abandoned buildings.Abandoned hope.
For generations we've tried to turn them around.Nothing has worked.But we may have found a way.
A way for Pennsylvania's most distressed communities to regain their souls -- reclaim their hope.
It's called the Keystone Opportunity Zones.
The idea is simple but profound.
Let's take Pennsylvania's most distressed locations -- and re-invent them.
"Let's declare them ""tax free zones."
"Why should government continue to tax neighborhoods that are economically distressed, barren?"
"Instead, let's waive the state and local taxes in those areas for up to 12 years -- and thus create the first real chance to stimulate jobs and community development."
The premise behind the Keystone Opportunity Zones is the premise behind our welfare reform: provide people with the tools they need to help themselves.
"Already, we've moved 62,000 Pennsylvanians from welfare to work."
But there are thousands more who still need our help.
"I propose a $23 million, 39% increase in job training for welfare recipients -- to give them the skills they need."
We also increase child-care funding for welfare recipients by more than $50 million -- because a welfare parent can't go to work if there's no one to watch the kids.
"By investing additional federal dollars in child care, we'll serve thousands more children and parents."
"Welfare reform is working in Pennsylvania -- because it's been reunited with the Pennsylvania values of family, education and work.All work has dignity."
And all Pennsylvanians should have a chance to realize that dignity within themselves.
"But for some Pennsylvanians, that's a lot harder than it sounds."
For people with disabilities -- the job market is a much different place than it is for the rest of us.Options are limited.Choices are few.
When it comes down to it -- finding a job sometimes has less to do with ability and more to do with access.
But it costs money to make a job accessible -- money that many small businesses simply don't have.
That's why today I propose a Capital Access Program to help small employers get the funds they need to make their jobs accessible to all qualified employees.
"But just as Pennsylvanians with disabilities deserve equal access to work -- they deserve equal access to play, too."
That's why our Department of Conservation and Natural Resources plans to invest $2.5 million to improve access to our state parks and facilities.
So the future Pennsylvania is one that even better fulfills our constitutional promise of equal opportunity for all.The future.
That's what this budget is all about.
Advances are moving at the speed of light.
And Pennsylvania cannot afford to stand still.
The kids in Mr. Campbell's class are not standing still.
Neither are the people at Kingdom Computers.
Or those students across the hall.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this budget does not stand still."
"Instead, it seeks to take Pennsylvania's next, great step into our next, great century."
"In our first century, Pennsylvania led the American Revolution -- with the strength of our beliefs."
"In our second century, we led the Industrial Revolution -- with the strength of our backs."
"In our third century, we have the potential to lead a new revolution -- with the strength of our minds, the force of our will, and the fortitude of our souls."
I believe that is Pennsylvania's destiny.
"Together, I know we can reach it.Thank you."
