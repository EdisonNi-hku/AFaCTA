SENTENCES
"Madame Speaker, Madame President, Senator Sullivan, Mr. Chief Justice, reverend clergy, friends, and guests."
"I want to begin by thanking members of both chambers of our General Assembly for the remarkable work you did just three weeks ago, in special session, on behalf of our capital city and the entire state of Connecticut."
I think there’s no doubt – together we scored a touchdown.
As important to me as the victory we achieved for Hartford – I am equally proud – of the example we set for our colleagues in other states.
"As you know, we astounded many with our ability to work together in the interest of Connecticut."
I know each of you will join me in the effort to continue that same bi-partisan approach that has worked so well for us over the last four years.
We seem to have the right recipe for success.
To the newly elected members of the General Assembly – welcome.
Thank you for making the decision to devote part of your life to public service.
"The next two years may be the most challenging two years you’ve ever faced, but I promise you, they will also be the most rewarding."
"A short while ago I was sworn in to serve a second term as Connecticut’s governor – an honor that humbles me, and challenges me to build upon our successes of the last four years."
Connecticut approaches the new millennium poised for continued and expanding prosperity.
"This is ""Connecticut’s Century."
The world economy has changed dramatically over the last ten years and for much of that time Connecticut was in a period of adjustment.
"But we have adapted to the changing times, and now Connecticut is on the field as a first class competitor."
"Our job in state government, is to create an environment which allows for continued economic growth."
"A vibrant, growing economy is the only factor that guarantees more Connecticut residents will share in this period of prosperity."
It is important that we not lose sight of the fundamental policies that have put us in such strong position.
"Yes - Connecticut is experiencing good times, but that is no reason for us to return to the days of big spending and tax increases."
"Our greatest challenge, over the next four years, will be to continue to control the cost and growth of state government."
"A lean government, free of excessive programs, rules and regulations, helps us keep our budget in balance, provide tax relief, and create economic opportunity."
Keeping a lid on the growth of government also gives us the option to invest wisely when the opportunity presents itself: - Creating a program to provide health coverage to uninsured children.
- Expanding programs to get children reading at an early age.
- Investing in higher education.
- Putting more police on the street.
These are just a few examples of what we’ve been able to do by following a fiscally conservative path.
"We have eliminated wasteful spending, invested as never before in prevention programs, and delivered tax cuts in each of the last four years."
My administration has made historic commitments to rebuild our public college and university campuses.
I will not retreat from those commitments.
"We have committed – together – to continue to address the Sheff vs. O’Neill desegregation case, make our schools safe, and to get the Hartford school system back on track.Those commitments stand."
"We have developed multi-year plans to revitalize our state parks, preserve open space, and clean up Long Island Sound."
Those plans will not be altered.
"And most important to me, we have entered into partnerships in cities across the state, to rebuild and infuse new life into the urban areas that were the backbone of Connecticut’s economy."
My administration will not retreat from any of the plans we have in place to revitalize our major cities.
Those plans represent our best chance to ensure economic success to those who are still struggling to make it in today’s very competitive world.
But revitalization is more than just a football stadium.
"It’s about creating economic opportunity, empowering neighborhoods, creating partnerships with the private sector, and having a vision to attract young people back to our urban communities."
Prudent budget management has allowed us to deliver budget surpluses in each of the last four years.
"As a result, we have filled our Rainy Day Fund, paid off debt, covered one time expenses, and - for the first time ever - delivered a tax rebate as part of a wide ranging tax cut program."
We will maintain our plans to increase the property tax credit – this year - to $350.
The plan to phase out the inheritance tax will continue.
The phase down of the tax on businesses will not be delayed.
"And our continued efforts to cut additional taxes - whenever and wherever possible - will not be derailed, including the possibility of another tax rebate."
"The need for a fiscally conservative approach to state government has never been more important, because while the demands in one area may be alleved by our growing economy, new demands are being placed on us."
- The need for new training and re-training programs has never been greater.
One of the biggest challenges Connecticut business is facing is a shortage of workers.
And we need to do our part to help.
- The children in the care of the Department of Children and Families must remain one of our top priorities.
I am committed to transforming that agency into an example for the rest of the country.
That includes the construction of a new juvenile justice facility at Long Lane and more employees to continue the quality of care so desperately needed.
- State employees should have the piece of mind to know they are working in a safe environment – and we are committed to making sure our state facilities are secure for our employees and the taxpayers they serve.
"We will continue to look for greater efficiencies and creative partnerships that will provide cutting edge resources to state government, and new ways to deliver services to the taxpayers of our state."
The use of new technology means new opportunities.
"Let’s lead the nation, rather than follow."
Ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly; the state of the state is in our hands.
Look at what we’ve accomplished together over the last four years: More people are working.
More people are earning higher wages.
More families are calling Connecticut home.Fewer people are on welfare.
More Connecticut high school students are choosing to attend college here at home.
And more businesses are taking advantage of all Connecticut’s economy has to offer.
There is a new spirit here in Connecticut.A new optimism.New hope.
"Four years ago I called it ""Connecticut’s Comeback.Well today we are back!"
"Stronger and more vibrant than ever, ready to make the next 100 years ""Connecticut’s Century."
To do so we must have the vision to look beyond the status quo.
"To raise expectations for our government, our schools, our cities, our families, and ourselves."
Always making our state more attractive to the next generation.
Over the last four years we have proven government can be prudent and compassionate.
We have proven that we can act with our hearts and our minds.
"These may be dark days in our nation’s capital, but not in Connecticut’s capital."
Together – we have rejected the politics of personal attack that has paralyzed our federal government and practiced what I call the politics of results.
The people of Connecticut deserve nothing less.
We were not sent here to do personal/partisan battle with each other.
We are here to do the people’s business.
"If we can always keep that in mind, there’s no limit to what we can achieve on behalf of the people of this state."
Let’s build on the record of the last four years.
Let’s use the offices we have been elected to to set a leadership example for all to see – and for us to be proud of.
Thank you and God bless the great state of Connecticut.
