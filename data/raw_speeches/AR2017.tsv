Thank you, and I salute you as well.

Speaking of history, 50 years ago today on January 10, 1967, Winthrop Rockefeller was inaugurated as the 37th Governor of Arkansas.
In addressing the 67th General Assembly, he said this: “It is true that you have been allotted an unusual moment in the history of Arkansas, as have I… a moment subject to special scrutiny… laden with special challenges… and rich with special opportunities.
I believe that together we can become worthy of the moment.
Today, ladies and gentleman, we have our own moment in history and we can only be worthy of this moment if we work together.
We, together, have been chosen by the people of Arkansas to govern and to lead in three, coequal branches of government—all represented here today.
And we must govern and lead, not only with a spirit of cooperation, but within the context of our time—our time in history.
And what defines our time in history?
Our place in history is defined—I think you will agree—by change.
Every generation faces change, but in today’s world though, the change comes at a faster clip than ever before.
Our time of change includes the exponential growth and unbounded potential of technology, the persistent challenge of terrorism, the competitive and ever-evolving global market place, and, quite frankly, the reduced level of confidence in our institutions of government.
All of this, all of this change impacts us here in Arkansas.
But while change defines our place in history, we must not be driven by the wind.
We must be anchored and confident that our character and values will shape the future of Arkansas and the decisions we make as leaders.
Most certainly, there is not a more exciting time to be an Arkansan.

I am committed to devoting my time and energy to these efforts, because it makes a difference for our state every day.
But there are other agenda items.
First, one of the goals of this administration is to improve the performance and efficiency of state government.
We need to eliminate unnecessary boards and commissions, and we need to realign a number of state agencies in order to wisely use taxpayer money and better provide services to the people of Arkansas.
Secondly, we must improve the way we fund higher education.
Let’s base the dollars to higher education, not on the number of students enrolled, but upon the educational progress of the students.
And so I ask you to support the new legislation that will create a new funding formula for higher education, and that you will help support the additional funding necessary to implement that higher education funding formula.
Thirdly, we should resolve to reform our tax code.
We need to lower our state income tax rate and be more competitive with our surrounding states.

Let’s create that task force, and I ask your support.
Fourthly, we also need to assure opportunity for the next generation.
This includes those who wish to go to college, those who choose to pursue a career—whether welding or construction—and those who feel left out through no fault of their own.
It is essential that we, as a state, give every high school student a simple promise: If you pursue a high need job skill or degree, then we will assure you that all your tuition and mandatory fees will be paid through a two-year college program or technical school.

It is called ArFuture Grants and it will require a mentoring program for the student.
It will require working in the state for three years after college.

I ask you also to remember those who are challenged with mental illness.

As Governor of Arkansas, I intend to represent all, and so I dedicate my administration to the people of Arkansas.
Today, I am honored to serve as Governor of Arkansas for all the people of this state.
May God bless each of us as we work to make sure the Arkansas Dream that I experienced is possible for everyone.
Thank you, and God bless this assembly.
