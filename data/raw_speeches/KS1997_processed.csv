SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Madam Chief Justice, Members of the Legislature and Fellow Kansans: For the third time, it is my honor to appear before you as Governor."
I particularly want to bring special greetings to the new members of the legislature and their families.
"It is my pleasure to report to you that the state of our state is sound, and our economy is robust."
Our average unemployment rate for the past year is the lowest in nearly two decades.
"New job creation occurred in every region of the state, totaling more than 30,000 jobs last fiscal year, and one out of five of those new jobs resulted, in part, from our aggressive state economic development programs and initiatives."
Personal income for 1996 is anticipated to have increased 6.2 percent.
Our state's rural areas continue to rebound in population.
Fifty-five of the state's 96 non-metropolitan counties increased population in 1995 over 1994.
"While the total net increase may be small, it reverses a decades-long trend of population loss from rural areas."
"Our eight-year, $3.2 billion highway program is entering its final year, on-schedule and on-budget."
"As this program comes to an end, I look forward to a constructive dialogue that assesses our future needs and plans to ensure those needs are met."
A quality highway infrastructure is vital to this state's economy and to our Kansas communities.
Thoughtful public policy and a partnership between the legislature and my Administration have contributed to our economic vitality by controlling spending and providing significant tax relief.
"However, most of the credit must go to the businesses of the state, both large and small, and to the women and men of Kansas whose skills and talents make the Kansas work force second to none."
"One of Kansas' most famous sons, academy award-winning playwright and author William Inge from Independence, in characterizing the state and its people used the term ""level."
Inge suggests we are a level-headed people with balance in our lives.
"He noted that while most Kansans were conservative, few were extreme."
"We are not a people who hold on to the past, nor do we wildly speculate on the future."
"That heritage is to be found everywhere in our state today as Kansans continually balance their careers, their families and their sense of community."
Those of us in public service have a responsibility to bring that balance to what we do.
"Within that framework, we must find ways to cut taxes, returning dollars to the people of this state who need the money more than government does."
"We must provide budgets that are fiscally responsible, yet are responsive to the needs of the 2.5 million Kansans we serve."
Let me repeat the message delivered to my senior management in this chamber one month ago.
"The people we serve are not just those who are the loudest, or those who are the most organized, or those who can afford to hire voices."
We also serve those Kansans who often don't have time to write or come to Topeka to speak before a committee.
They may not know where to write or how to find a voice in government.These Kansans must be heard.
This message presents to the people of Kansas and this legislature.
proposals that I believe capture the Kansas sense of balance and fairness.
"This message presents a responsible budget, responsive initiatives and a reduction of tax dollars collected from our citizens."
Responsible Budget My budget recommendations offer a responsible but limited growth of 2.4 percent in general fund spending -- less than the current rate of inflation.
"For fiscal year 1998, the total general fund budget I recommend is $3.75 billion."
"The total budget I recommend from all sources for fiscal year 1998 is $7.89 billion, a reduction of $17.4 million compared to the previous year."
"It's not a standstill budget, for we do not live in a standstill world."
"-- We cannot ask our schools to do a better job with children that society, not schools, has placed at risk, and then refuse to enhance at-risk programs."
-- We cannot live in a technological world and deny our post-secondary students access to technology.
"-- We cannot create a new justice system for juveniles without adequate funding, nor demand longer sentences for adult criminals and fail to provide adequate prison space."
-- We cannot ask a reduced state work force to do more without fair compensation.
-- We cannot ignore the reality of inflation.This budget speaks for itself.
"Every item, every line was reviewed."
Successful programs were enhanced and marginal programs were reduced or eliminated.
"While Kansans want conservative fiscal management, they also deserve quality government services that meet the changing needs of our state."
They do not believe in diminishing the future by failing to invest in state government services today.
Responsive Initiatives I am pleased to tell you that within this thoughtful budget are dozens of program enhancements and new initiatives.
"I am a believer in education, and I am a supporter of education at all levels."
"Included in my education initiatives are the following: I recommend adding $4 million -- an increase of 20 percent -- to at-risk funding so our schools can invest today in children who face the greatest challenges, rather than pay higher costs tomorrow; I recommend providing new, additional funding of $10 million for special education; I recommend providing nearly $20 million -- not only to fund the third year of high correlation weighting, but to accelerate the fourth year into the '97-'98 school year -- to more quickly address the inequity in the school finance formula identified by the 1995 legislature; and, I recommend providing $12 million of additional funding to increase the base budget per pupil for education by $22 to $3,670."
"For the Regents institutions, I propose $7.5 million for investment in technology to ensure Kansas students learn in an environment that adequately prepares them for a technological world."
"Not long ago, I reminded the senior management of my Administration that we must provide higher quality service to our customers, the people of Kansas."
"During the past two years, we reduced the number of state employees at a rate of nearly 100 each month."
"However, we have continually asked state employees to do a better job of providing service to the public."
It is imperative we fairly compensate these employees.
"I am proposing step movement, a 1 percent base salary adjustment and full funding of longevity for classified employees, and a 3.5 percent unclassified merit pool."
Being tough on crime carries a responsibility for providing adequate space to house criminals.
We will not make Kansas safe by putting violent criminals on our streets rather than in prison.
"We have immediate needs that must be met by expanding existing prison capacity by 550 beds at Norton, Hutchinson and El Dorado."
"This is in addition to current expansion of 251 beds at Lansing, Winfield and Larned."
"Long-term needs still must be addressed, and I look forward to a productive discussion this session."
Being responsible also means meeting our obligations.
"Since 1978, the debt owed on El Dorado State Lake has gone unpaid."
"Under my direction, we have negotiated a final settlement with the Corps of Engineers, and my budget will pay this debt in full."
Not to do so could incur costly litigation or risk additional federal funding.
One of the most significant reforms of our time -- the remaking of welfare across America -- is being aggressively implemented by this Administration.
"As we seek our goal of returning welfare recipients to the work force, we must address the needs of those who will be affected by this transition."
"My budget includes enhanced funding for additional child care and employment services for welfare recipients, and assistance for legal immigrants -- most of them elderly."
"Also, we will continue appropriate at-home services or placement in long-term care for seniors."
"While we have reduced employees in most of the agencies reporting to my office, there are some staffing needs that must be met."
One example is the addition of nine positions for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment for its Confined Feeding Lot Operations.
"These positions are being added to ensure adequate monitoring of ground water quality, and some of those positions will operate out of a newly established district office in Southwest Kansas."
"Besides continuing the steady progress made by our Water Quality Initiative, other environmental efforts include: -- funding for a salt contamination study of the Ogallala Aquifer; -- funding for lead removal in the Cherokee County superfund site; -- funding for abandoned water, oil and gas well plugging; and -- funding the administrative costs of a program that will access $12 million in loans for local communities to improve their water systems."
All these initiatives are important to maintaining the healthy environment Kansans deserve.
"While reducing the tax burden of Kansans was achieved during the last two sessions, it is not enough to simply cut taxes."
"We must maintain a tax system that is fair, user-friendly and equitable."
"My proposal for a Taxpayer Fairness Plan, which includes a more taxpayer-friendly appeal and hearing officer process and support for the county appraisal process, will enhance customer service."
This plan is a priority of my Administration.
For the third year I ask you to strengthen the ethics laws of this state.
"My ethics proposal will: -- prohibit political action committee, corporate and union contributions while the legislature is in session; -- eliminate gifts and hospitality for virtually all executive branch employees under my jurisdiction; and -- ensure that special interest groups, in-state and out-of-state, who financially participate in Kansas elections have an obligation to tell Kansans who they are, what they spent and where they got their money."
"To restore Kansans' faith in government, we must address the issues of ethics and campaign finance reform."
The initiatives I have just reviewed are but a few of the responsive measures found throughout the budget and in the legislative proposals of my Cabinet.
I want to thank and express appreciation to my Cabinet who have given two years of outstanding service to this state and who continue to aggressively pursue new ways to better serve our customers -- the people of Kansas.
"Reduce the Tax Burden on the People and Businesses of Kansas For the third year in a row, I recommend responsible tax cuts and a plan to reduce the tax burden on the people and businesses of this state."
"I am proposing a fair and balanced package which does not favor one tax over another, but seeks to bring greater equity to a wide range of taxes."
"In fiscal year 1998, more than $112 million in new tax relief will be provided by the package of tax cuts I propose."
They are: The Elimination of the Premiums Tax on Annuities: This tax has restricted Kansas insurance companies in their efforts to do business nationwide.
I join with the Insurance Commissioner and the Interim Legislative Committee in asking you to allow Kansas companies to be more successful by eliminating this noncompetitive tax.
"An Income Tax Credit for Commercial and Industrial Property Taxes Paid on Machinery and Equipment: To be competitive, our Kansas businesses must continually invest in machinery and equipment on which the state imposes a property tax."
"To begin to relieve that burden, I am proposing a 10 percent income tax credit for property taxes paid on commercial and industrial machinery and equipment."
"This will be significant, especially to small business owners who are vital to continuing our healthy Kansas economy."
"An Income Tax Credit for Adoptions: We need to reduce the financial burden of our young families, our limited income families, and all families who wish to adopt children."
"While the state is committed to moving children from foster care into permanent homes, we also must be committed to encouraging families to adopt all children in need of a home."
I know from personal experience there are significant costs involved.
"Therefore, I propose a $2,500 tax credit for those who adopt, and I encourage Kansans to open their hearts and their homes to these children."
"Expansion of the Homestead Property Tax Rebate: I propose increasing the income eligibility for the homestead property tax rebate from $17,200 to $25,000 and adjusting the refund table to provide larger refunds."
This will allow more individuals to become eligible for homestead tax rebates beginning in 1998.
"In addition, I have directed the Department of Revenue to simplify and promote the application process."
Enhancement of the Rebate for Sales Tax Paid on Food: No one can argue that sales tax on food impacts low-income Kansans the most.
Those families with the least to spend must dedicate a significant portion of their budgets to food and therefore are taxed at a disproportionately high level.
"The current qualifying income level is $13,000."
"I recommend the level be raised to $25,000, with the average refund rising from $43 to $85 per household."
"Again, this will be accompanied by a directive to the Department of Revenue to simplify the process."
"Repeal of the Sales Tax on Remodeling: In 1995, I proposed and you adopted a repeal of sales tax used in labor for new construction."
I ask you to continue our strong efforts for tax equity by repealing the sales tax on labor used in both residential and commercial remodeling.
"General Property Tax Reduction: Reducing the uniform school finance levy is important, and I promised last year to reduce it as aggressively as our finances would allow."
"Fulfilling that promise, I am recommending the levy be reduced from 35 mills to 29 mills this year, and to 25 mills next year."
"By the year 2000, this 30 percent reduction, coupled with the previously passed 50 percent reduction of property taxes paid on automobiles, will provide Kansans with $775 million of property tax relief."
Tax Rates Paid by Single Kansans: The Kansas Supreme Court recently held the differential between single and married taxpayers was constitutional.
"This was an important case in establishing the state's rights in developing tax policy, and is a case it was both appropriate and necessary for the state to pursue."
"However, the fact that it's legal does not necessarily mean it's fair."
I have weighed the issue and am firm in my belief that it is not fair.
"It is not fair that a single parent, struggling to keep a family intact, has more taken from his or her paycheck."
It is not fair the state adds to the burden of grief caused by the loss of a spouse by raising the survivor's income tax.
"On behalf of the 500,000 Kansans who file as single taxpayers, I urge this legislature to adopt my proposal to lower the rates of single taxpayers over the next three years to match those rates paid by married Kansans."
My tax reduction package offers for the people of this state more than $112 million in new tax cuts over and above that provided for in the past two years.
"Additionally, I recommend to you we continue for a fourth year the moratorium on unemployment taxes, allowing businesses to reinvest these dollars."
"With the progress made over the last two years, this will bring total tax reductions for 1998 to $436 million, delivering to the people of Kansas -- through the year 2000 -- more than $2 billion in tax relief."
"Given these tax cuts will be provided without offsetting tax increases, our success in reducing the tax burden for Kansans is unprecedented in the history of this state."
"Before leaving the subject of tax reduction, I must make two points absolutely clear."
"First, as I said in my message last year, and am even more committed to this year, I will veto any tax reduction plan that raises some taxes to lower others."
"There will be no ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" while I am Governor."
The second issue concerns our 7.5 percent ending balance as required by law.
"The legislators who worked hard to get this ending balance requirement in the statute books clearly anticipated a need to reserve state funds for unexpected expenses -- be it a natural disaster, a lawsuit ruling or a major economic downturn."
"In these situations, it may be prudent to use the state's ending balances to meet those urgent needs."
We as policy makers must be careful to consider the fiscal integrity of the state when we suggest tampering with the ending balance.
"In a year of a conservative 2.4 percent budget increase and a tax package that provides more than $112 million of new relief to Kansans, I am reluctant to deviate from this sound, conservative fiscal policy."
"Conclusion I believe I have presented to you a responsive budget, progressive initiatives and aggressive tax cuts that will serve all Kansans, as they are balanced and fair."
To speculate on the economic security of this state by spending dollars that do not exist is inappopropriate.
There is no Kansas charge card.
"Speculation about the future is neither cause to abandon conservative economic principles, nor cause for an unwarranted reduction in the state's protection against economic calamity -- the 7.5 percent ending balance."
"I encourage us all to debate priorities within the framework of a conservative, responsive budget and reasonable and responsible tax reductions as proposed in this message."
This legislature and this Administration have demonstrated they can achieve good things when working together.
I look forward to sharing our continued success.
I wish this legislature well in its deliberations and send my best wishes to all Kansans for a healthy and successful 1997.
