sentences
Speaker Tempest, President Coe, legislators, First Lady Sherri, Supreme Court Justices, elected officials, Tribal Leaders, our staff, students, teachers and others watching by television, listening statewide on the radio, or downloading from the Internet- Good Morning and welcome to this Special Session of the 56th Wyoming Legislature!
Mr. Speaker, thank you and your fellow House members for your hospitality in hosting us.
Chief Justice Lehman, I thank you and your colleagues for hosting the three branches of government this morning for breakfast.
The Governor is empowered in the Wyoming Constitution to convene the Legislature on extraordinary occasions.
With the concurrence of the legislative leadership, I have called this Special Session for you to consider three major issues – the budget, redistricting, and education finance.
Each issue is complex in itself.
To have all three along with other matters is extraordinary, and worthy of the special session we are convening.
As Governor, I am also tasked by the Constitution to communicate to you the condition of the state and to recommend such measures as may be expedient.
I had the special privilege just a week ago last Tuesday to be on the floor of the United States House of Representatives when our President George W. Bush delivered his State of the Union address.
He opened his remarks by saying, “ .
. . our Nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers.
Yet the state of our Union has never been stronger!” Mr. Speaker, while our nation is at war and its economy is in recession, the condition of our state is good.
Our economy is strong, our schools are excellent, our revenues are at a slight surplus and we have no insurrection within our borders.
Can we be better?
Can we do better?
Yes, we can, but as we consider the challenges facing us, we have much for which we can be thankful.
Today is February 11th.
Five months ago today, our world changed.
None of us will ever forget where we were or what we felt on September 11th.
The United States was attacked by terrorists who thought that they would weaken us.
Instead, their attacks strengthened us.
They thought they would divide us; instead, they united us - as a nation and as a people.
From the hour of the attack, and in the five months that have followed, we have a new respect for our men and women who are the first responders and on the front line- our police, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and the military, each in uniform, men and women, who continue to fight, to respond, to protect us here and abroad.
Together, we extend a special thank you to each of them - those serving here at home and those serving overseas.
We thank them and their families for the enormous sacrifices they have made and continue to make.
Our state and our nation afford us the privilege to live in peace because these dedicated men and women are willing to serve us and to defend our liberty.
Our Future: By Choice, Not by Chance Seven years ago, I stood at this podium for the first time to evaluate the state of our state.
Today as I deliver my eighth and final message, I note how we have worked together through our citizens to make investments in our state and to give us the tools we need to prosper.
Our role is to enable our citizens, to empower them to reach their economic and social goals for themselves and for the next generation.
Prosperity doesn’t just magically appear.
Today we have the tools in place to shape our own destiny.
Our efforts in education, the Wyoming Business Council, environmental quality, and other activities have given us better jobs with better pay and more job opportunities for our youth.
We have an education system that is world class, one which provides our children with the tools they need to achieve their personal, social and economic goals and to succeed anywhere in the world.
We have developed state services so that we build equity for the future and capacity through innovation.
We have built a safer, more secure Wyoming.
We have chosen to provide access to and quality of health care for all our citizens.
We have emphasized community-based delivery of services and we have focused on community-based solutions rather than state dictated mandates.
The people who work for our state deliver services as partners, not as stand-alone, unconnected agencies.
We are positioned to build on our successes.
THE WYOMING ECONOMY Wyoming is one of just a few states not experiencing a significant economic downturn.
We have had consecutive years of job growth since 1997 during which we increased overall wages and added over 21,000 jobs, as is vividly pointed out in graphical form below.
We have felt the impact of September 11th but not to the degree that the rest of America has.
We had an increase of 4,500 jobs in December of 2001 as compared to the previous year.
Our unemployment rate stands at a very low 3.9 percent compared to the national unemployment rate of 5.8 percent.
The December 2001 Wyoming Labor Force Trends published by the Wyoming Department of Employment reports that Wyoming has experienced tremendous economic growth for the period 1997 through 2000, with a leveling-off in 2001.
The report goes on to say that 2001 was still a very promising year in the face of national economic downturn.
We are still near the peak of our economic momentum.
Now is the time to take actions that will help sustain our momentum and minimize the effects of a downturn.
Our goals focus on our number one resource – our young people.
Wyoming has always looked to its youth as being its promise for the future.
That is no different today than when I first ran for public office over 20 years ago.
We must create better job opportunities for our youth.
My vision, no our vision, is for all of Wyoming to work together to build more and better opportunities for our children and grandchildren.
Wyoming must continue to develop a broader-based, more diversified economy that appeals to young families.
Technology can enable our efforts to diversify.
We must continue to shape our future.
Far too often, in the past, we have chosen to take what happens by chance rather than making things happen by choice.
Setting the Foundation for a Long-Term Solution – Diversify the Economy We can take advantage of the Wyoming economic momentum of the past two years while the national economy gets back on track.
· For the near term, I recommend that you approve actions for new construction of schools and state buildings through bond authority, accelerate additions to our highway system through a user fee increase, fund water development projects, eliminate the one week waiting period for workers to collect unemployment benefits and lower unemployment insurance rates for employers.
· For the longer term, I recommend that you extend the authority of the Wyoming Business Council, add to our workforce training funds, enhance connectivity by installing fiber conduit in our highway right-of-way, and add a Technology Incubator on the University of Wyoming campus.
Construction is a time-honored means to pick up some of the economic slack until the rest of the economy catches up.
If we accelerate the schedule for contracts, we can stimulate job growth more quickly.
We need new schools.
Our local communities have long used bonding authority to finance schools.
Now that the State is responsible for financing construction, we should continue the practice of bond financing in order to meet the Supreme Court’s mandate for school building adequacy.
I support the Joint Education Committee’s recommendation to establish a school facilities commission to oversee school capital construction.
The University and Community Colleges need new buildings.
Some of these identified needs already have private and other funds dedicated to them.
We need to provide the last measure of funding for the University’s effort through bonds, particularly for the Health Sciences Center and the Technology Incubator.
I support the Select Committee on Finance and Capital Investment’s recommendation to establish a commission to oversee the financing and construction of state buildings.
The Joint Appropriations Committee has taken action on smaller projects that could be funded from earmarked and dedicated accounts.
I concur with their actions for projects not covered by general funds.
The remaining projects have received a strong recommendation from your State Building Commission and I support the construction of these projects through revenue bonds.
For the safety of our travelers and the health of our economy, we need to accelerate highway construction, particularly four-lane roads.
Our Wyoming highway system has long been touted as the best in the region.
We are in danger of slipping into second best or worse.
Safety is of prime concern ever since we lost eight of our finest youth in a tragic crash south of Laramie last year.
Our Wyoming Department of Transportation will need additional funds to meet our safety and economic goals for the future.
I support a user fee increase on fuel and gasoline to put us on our way to meeting our transportation goals.
Water development continues to be a hallmark for enhancing our future.
I support the Select Water Committee’s recommendations for planning and construction of this year’s water development projects, particularly those smaller projects that can help ease the impact of the current drought.
Investing in Our Communities and People The addition of the Workforce Training Account in the last session became a powerful tool to encourage business expansion and relocation.
To date we have issued 164 grants to train 2,823 employees in 116 businesses with $2.8 million spent of the $3.0 million you approved last year.
Fully 75 percent of the funds went to existing Wyoming employers.
I support adding funds this year to assure our future growth.
Our Wyoming Department of Employment has proposed legislation for unemployment tax reductions and improvements in worker benefits.
I ask for your support to enact the revisions and to institute a 25 percent unemployment insurance tax reduction in 2003.
Your actions will have the effect of putting approximately $9 million into the hands of the business community.
You created the Wyoming Business Council as your partner to work with community leaders and businesses to energize Wyoming’s economy and assure long-term economic growth.
Your faith in its purpose is paying off.
After four years of operation, the Wyoming Business Council is an unqualified success.
Each of the 40 communities that I have visited over the last few months has given full support to the effectiveness of the Wyoming Business Council, especially for how they have responded to goals developed within each community.
The Wyoming Business Council and the Wyoming Rural Development Council are jointly helping develop community assessments to identify strengths and weaknesses and recommend steps to prepare for economic growth that is compatible for that particular community.
Fifteen community assessments have been completed and seven more are scheduled.
I strongly recommend that the sunset date of 2003 be removed to validate your full endorsement and support of the Wyoming Business Council.
Our communities can’t support economic growth without a solid base for operations and infrastructure.
For several years, the Legislature has studied and evaluated local government finance.
We have a good idea of the problems facing our cities, towns and counties but have offered little in the way of solutions.
Local governing bodies face financial pressures for both operating expenses and capital outlay for infrastructure.
Last year, you imposed a cap on automatic distribution of mineral severance taxes and federal royalties.
Your intent was to have local governments demonstrate need for their projects so that they could be compared to programs that may need funding at the state level.
The de-earmarking bill, known as SF 9, imposed the cap and allocated funds to the general fund and the budget reserve account.
I recommend that over-the-cap income be allocated to local governments through the Cities, Towns and Counties Capital Construction Account under the State Loan and Investment Board.
The backlog of capital projects is very large.
Your State Loan and Investment Board was only able to fund one-fourth of the recent requests brought to our attention.
Local governments have experienced many of the same operating cost increases that state government has but have not had a corresponding rise in operating revenues.
Health care premiums, utility costs, and increased population have strained our communities and counties.
To ease the pressure on our local governments, I support the reallocation of sales tax revenues to increase the local government’s share to be applied to their operating budgets.
Connecting Communities Wyoming has been slow to join the prosperity that is possible in the New Economy.
The New Economy is more than technology, but it needs technology in order to work effectively.
Fewer than 25 percent of our businesses regularly use high speed Internet as a routine part of their business, partly because of lack of awareness of what benefits it brings and partly due to lack of high-speed bandwidth.
We need to increase our access to high-speed connectivity.
I heard this loud and clear from people statewide in the communities I’ve recently visited.
Our overall strategy is to have the state and education act as anchor tenants on a statewide network that, once installed by private providers to meet education and state needs, can be expanded to provide services to businesses, local governments and personal activities.
We have made progress, but are hampered by a lack of competition.
That is changing, however, with companies such as RT Communications, Allwest, and other independent providers who are willing to put services into our communities.
Just last week, the Board of Land Commissioners approved a long-term lease to enable a start up Wyoming company to deliver high-speed access to Wyoming communities and businesses along our southern border.
The company will use fiber optic lines previously dedicated to the State as consideration for easements across state lands.
They will offer competitive prices for even better telecommunications and cable services.
Productivity has been the hallmark of new business vitality nationwide, enabled through connectivity and technology.
We can accelerate business development and job diversity in Wyoming through more and better telecommunications, provided that rights-of-way can be secured in a timely manner.
I recommend that we authorize the installation of empty fiber conduit along our interstate and primary highways.
This can be made available to competitive bidders for fiber optic installation to enhance our communities’ connections with the world.
Two of our newest businesses in Wyoming manufacture polyethelyne pipes and conduit and even have the ability to install fiber lines in the tubing during the basic fabrication process should that be needed.
In the longer-term, we still need to focus on what diversifies the job market especially for young families.
It is not just energy development.
Yes, our core industries of agriculture, energy and tourism continue to be important but technology has enhanced the productivity in these areas to where increases in production are occurring while total employment is dropping.
Nearly every state has the ability to take advantage of the creativity and innovative ideas of faculty and students at major research universities.
We need to do the same here in Wyoming just to remain competitive.
We can develop spin-off businesses and commercialize ideas and research that come from our UW campus.
I ask for your support for matching funds through bond authority to establish a Technology Incubator on the University of Wyoming campus.
Connecting Citizens with their Government New businesses are attracted to states that are capable of delivering citizen and business services online.
The productive use of technology will stimulate the new economy in Wyoming.
Last year you authorized the beginning of the Wyoming ePortal to grant easy access to effective services online.
I recommend that you continue the funding for the electronic portal.
Government can model the proper use of technology and stimulate businesses to do the same.
Our schools are already leading the way to make technology literacy the norm.
Our students gain today through enhanced learning opportunities and gain for the future by inoculating our businesses with their expectations that business will use technology routinely.
Wyoming pioneered the concept of the anchor tenant in connectivity, purchasing services for our schools, our health delivery system and our public safety system to encourage private investors to develop high-speed networks across the state and expand them for business and personal use.
Wyoming agencies have all developed websites to furnish displays of information that anyone can access.
That is the most basic of online services.
Wyoming must move aggressively to offer fully interactive web-based services online.
Several agencies are offering services that are interactive, but not fully integrated or coordinated.
The ePortal can change that.
We have made progress.
The University has developed a full range of online interactive services, especially to support all student needs and activities, in addition to offering online courses and extensive research databases.
Other agencies’ interactive services online include: Department of Revenue – File sales and mineral tax returns, make electronic funds transfer State Parks and Cultural Resources – Purchase day use and camping permits Livestock Board – Apply for entry permits and health certificates Public Service Commission – Utility annual report filing Lands and Investments – Forms for mineral auctions Department of Employment Wyoming was one of the first states to implement unemployment insurance claims filing over the Internet.
The Wyoming Job Network is Internet accessible and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Job seekers can self-register for work and refer themselves to job openings.
Employers can self-enter job orders and match their needs with available job seekers.
Oil and Gas Commission – Well records and production reporting Wyoming Business Council – Tourism and travel planning Wyoming Department of Transportation – Road and travel reports, web cam displays Wyoming State Library - Data Base Department of Health Developmental Disabilities – Download training videos While all these services are a step in the right direction, they aren’t integrated, they don’t have the capacity to allow online credit card payments or other electronic payments and not all use standard formats.
We can and should change that by fully supporting the ePortal program.
The Joint Appropriations Committee has expressed its frustration with what appears to be fragmentation of state agency technology projects.
I agree with the committee’s recommendation to add a Chief Information Officer to oversee and coordinate the productive use of technology for the state.
For a specific project, I recommend funding for our implementation of the Health Passport.
The Health Passport Project has operated with the support of the Western Governors’ Association and with the direct participation of the states of Nevada and North Dakota.
The Passport uses smart card technology that allows higher quality of care for eligible clients of the state that will eventually cover five major programs – Medicaid, immunizations, the Women and Infant Children nutrition program known as WIC, the Maternal and Child Health program and Head Start.
In addition to providing greater access, portability and convenience to mothers and children, the state will benefit by a dramatic reduction in costs, especially through the elimination of the fraudulent receipt of benefits.
ENERGY The energy boom last year was a real blessing to Wyoming.
Energy has been a great stimulant for the revenue that flows to our state treasury.
Energy provides the income for well over half of all our education expenses.
My attention to fostering our energy sector is for one basic reason: For our kids.
Energy has captured our attention not in deference to the energy companies or in particular to the jobs generated by the energy patch.
Our goal is to deliver education.
Energy is key to our kids’ future.
Developing our energy resources then, is not just a choice between energy and the environment.
It is a full partnership that recognizes how energy, the economy, the environment and education all work for mutual benefit.
Today we recognize that energy will continue to be our primary funding for state services while we work to diversify our economy and our tax base.
Our challenge will continue to be how the least populated state in the Union can preserve its character and what we like about the wide-open spaces while we pick up and compete in the national and world economy.
I note the hesitancy of our people in Wyoming to have population growth, but frankly, we do need more people, especially young families.
Wyoming has become a major influence in developing regional and national energy policy.
The Wyoming Energy Commission has filled a void that existed while all other natural resources in Wyoming had both advocacy and regulatory assistance.
The report delivered to you contains the Commission’s recommendations for energy conservation, renewable energy development, enhanced development of our fossil fuels, and strong support for environmental protections while streamlining permitting processes.
The report specifically notes that none of our current environmental protections should be removed or diminished.
The Commission is in the process of evaluating the impact of coal bed methane development on our cities and counties.
The Commission deserves your full support.
We still must deal with mineral valuation for taxation purposes, especially natural gas.
Your Minerals and Economic Interim Committee has labored long and hard to draft changes on valuation.
We need to bring their effort to a productive conclusion.
I support the committee’s effort.
Wyoming is well positioned to properly develop our fossil fuels, particularly natural gas and coal.
We have great potential for wind energy development.
Our network of gas pipelines and railroads will make Wyoming’s raw energy available nationwide.
However, the benefits of adding value to our energy to ship it by wire are hampered by the lack of adequate transmission lines.
Our priority must be to add value to our energy resources before exporting them to other states and nations.
I’m glad to let you know that as I travel throughout the state, I have heard resounding support for this priority.
I have solid commitments from my fellow Western governors along with the President’s cabinet agencies to include us as full partners in the development of our energy resources and in particular, to aid in the planning, financing and construction of electric transmission lines.
REVENUES Last year when you met in General Session, the state revenues were expected to generate a surplus of $694 million, an unprecedented and almost unbelievable amount.
Through your actions last year, about one-third of the surplus was allocated to spending priorities, about one-third was set aside in reserves, and one-third was held while we determined what this year’s priorities would be, especially for school finance.
You chose wisely to go slowly.
The budget that I submitted to you last December was based upon the best information available at the time, especially with regard to school finance and revenue estimates.
Today, we have updated numbers to work with and I’m pleased to report that we can meet our highest priorities for spending and still leave the necessary five percent reserve that is prudent for our operation.
I support funding the five percent statutory reserve.
State revenue increases are still driven by enhanced mineral income.
I caution, however, that the phenomenal increases we experienced over the past two years will not continue at the same pace.
Natural gas prices are back in their normal range compared to the astronomical prices of a year ago.
Coal and oil prices experienced a temporary increase as well, to a lesser degree, and have dropped back to historical averages.
Our forecast for mineral production indicates a continuing strong demand for natural gas, sustained demand for coal but a decline in production of oil.
Overall, we can expect to receive modest increases from energy income over the next few years, but it will come mainly from production increases, not price increases.
One particularly bright spot was the significant coal lease bonus that was announced at the end of last month.
That will help fund school construction needs that were already under consideration.
In order to help facilitate the production needed to sustain our revenue needs, I recommend adding resources to our agencies involved with environmental protection and regulatory permitting to help balance production with our environmental responsibilities.
The State Engineer’s Office, Department of Environmental Quality, the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, the State Historic Preservation Office and the State Geological Survey have had significant increases in demand for their services.
Sales tax revenues continue to increase at a steady rate, enabling us with our largest source of income to the General Fund.
Receipts have remained above historical levels mostly due to increased construction and mineral development.
Sales taxes are the most stable and predictable source of income and tend to reflect the strength of our overall economy.
We will have to sustain our current economic momentum if we are to meet the spending expectations inherent in the budget on your desks today.
Our return on state investments has remained steady in contrast to other states’ sharp declines.
The amount of income received from investments is the second largest source of income to our General Fund, and is the equivalent of $1,000 per worker per year if it were to be paid in taxes rather than being received as investment income.
Investment income gives us a most welcome cushion, thanks to your support of State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis’s initiatives to enhance investment and spending policies.
I support the added legislation she is proposing this session.
EXPENDITURES The budget that you will consider during this session is comprehensive but conservative.
My recommendations are community centered, not state dominated.
Immediate Needs for the FY2001-2002 Budget and the Governor’s Flex Authority This year, I did not request any supplemental appropriation to cover the balance of our current fiscal period.
That is unprecedented in recent history.
None of us can recall when the governor made no supplemental budget request during the last year of the budget period.
The credit belongs to the agencies that have made sacrifices and used creative management to meet our state needs.
Several agencies had requested supplemental appropriations to meet shortfalls in the current budget period.
Health, family services, livestock, elections and the state geologist were among service areas facing shortfalls.
In accordance with the authority that you granted me to transfer unused funds to areas of shortfall, I was able to cover over $21 million of requests without adding to this year’s budget request.
Given the effectiveness of Flex Authority in the budget, I recommend the continuation of the governor’s flex authority in the upcoming biennium at least at the 20 percent level.
The Big Four – Education, Health, Public Safety and Family Services Of the many programs funded through the state, only four major areas dominate, consuming seven of every eight dollars allocated through our state’s general fund.
They are Education, Health, Public Safety and Family Services.
State government is often characterized as a big, faceless bureaucracy that consumes all the money we might feed it.
Government growth just seems inevitable.
That stereotype is misplaced and misunderstood.
Much of the recent growth in state government has come from programs that you added intentionally.
Two years ago you passed the No Net New Programs bill because we wanted to get a handle on government growth.
Last year many initiatives and activities were greatly enhanced in funding or were expanded or were created that did not fall under the current definition for program.
I encourage you to look at tightening the definition so that we can properly fund current programs before adding new ones.
Funding for education, enhanced health coverage for kids, treatment for traumatic brain injury, drug courts, treatment programs, long-term care alternatives for the elderly are but a few of the initiatives recently added through legislation or budget actions.
Very little of the growth in government spending has come from added personnel.
New money added to programs is being spent in all of our 23 counties in Wyoming.
To illustrate, the chart below shows the trend of expenses for health and social services in Wyoming from 1980 through 2000.
If the chart is extended to cover the 2003-2004 biennium, it shows a 50 percent increase in just four years.
Most noteworthy is the very low cost of personnel (lowest shaded area).
The balance of the chart indicates that 85 percent of the funds are spent in our 23 counties on clients and service providers.
Education As President Bush said the other night, “Good jobs begin with good schools.
We have an excellent education system in Wyoming.
We continue to work to make it better and be able to prove its effectiveness for our children.
This year, education is again my number one budget and program priority.
The cost of education continues to rise while total enrollment continues to drop.
The best solution for our state’s education is directly tied to our economy.
The continuing decline in school age population is alarming.
Schools are challenged to maintain programs and services in the face of declining enrollments.
The decline is indicative of young families not coming to Wyoming or not staying in Wyoming.
We need to create better, more diversified jobs to attract young families.
Quality of Education: Standards, Assessment, and Technology When I delivered my first State of the State, we had no consistent standards to gauge whether we were teaching what our kids needed to know or how to measure their performance.
Today we do.
Wyoming teachers, parents, businesses and community leaders have worked hard to put in place standards to ensure that our children will be able to compete in a world economy and succeed in our national society.
Standards for subject matter are essential to that purpose.
We define what they should know, and then we are obligated to show that they know it.
Assessment tests aren’t meant to aggravate but to motivate, to identify what works and provide us the information we need to improve teaching and learning.
We are well on our way to effectively implementing standards-based instruction in our classrooms.
Many other states are slowing their efforts to implement higher standards.
Wyoming should resist that trend.
With our Wyoming Comprehensive Assessment System (WyCAS) and accountability systems in place, we can assure our kids that they will know what they will need to achieve not only their economic potential but also their educational, social and personal goals.
I spend time in schools with students, teachers and administrators regularly on my travels in Wyoming.
The misinformation that initially clouded the acceptance of standards and the purpose of assessments is quickly giving way to the discovery of how effective we can be in enhancing student achievement.
The Wyoming Comprehensive Assessment System is recognized nationwide as one of the finest school improvement tools.
Recruiting and Retaining Qualified Teachers Teacher quality is the greatest factor influencing student achievement, making the continued availability of professional development for teachers very important.
I ask for your approval of funding for professional development of teachers and classroom leaders for three community-based sites.
Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Judy Catchpole and I had originally requested funding for five sites, which are still needed, but we ask that you at least fund three of the sites.
These three sites received start-up funding through a competitive grant.
Now that we know how effective site-based development can really be, we need your support to maintain the sites after the grant funds expire this year.
We must create a candidate pool of highly qualified teachers and leaders to replace the ever-increasing number of teachers who are retiring.
We have made great progress in professional development through initiatives such as Project WyoBEST, the semi-annual teacher development conferences hosted by Superintendent Judy Catchpole, and the Wyoming Teacher Policy Institute.
Project WyoBEST is a professional development project designed to enhance teachers’ and administrators’ use of technology in schools.
The teacher policy institute grew out of my involvement with the National Teachers Policy Institute that encourages teachers to become involved in how education policy is set both at the state and the national level.
The leadership training provides teachers with innovative professional development activities and second career individuals with opportunities to enter the classroom.
I ask for your support of the budget item for 21st Century Learning.
This will ensure that we continue to provide opportunities to improve the quality of teachers and teaching in our public schools.
We will continue to face challenges in the training and recruitment of quality teachers, but some perspective is in order.
We have one of the nation’s highest certification rates- 96 percent of all positions in Wyoming’s public schools are filled by a certified teacher.
However, we know that some of our remote districts have difficulty attracting replacement teachers.
Likewise, certain content areas such as foreign language, counselors and special education are hard to fill.
To deal with filling these positions, I support legislation that deals with targeting critical occupations that face shortages, including teaching, in which the person receiving a loan from the state would have that loan forgiven if he or she chose to remain in Wyoming after completing a teaching degree and commits to working in the teaching profession.
Early Childhood/Reading Nothing is as important to a child’s success as to be able to read proficiently at or before third grade.
Your approval of the K-3 reading enhancement program last year has been a great way to significantly improve student success in later grades.
I ask for your support to enhance the K-3 reading initiative proposed in the budget.
Data Management Our ability to collect and analyze financial and assessment information is hampered by the lack of resources to document successes, problems and trends.
I ask for your support to adequately fund data management especially so that we can deliver the statewide report card of school and student achievement that you directed in the school reform legislation.
Health and Safety No school is totally isolated from violence or traumatic events.
Routine health and safety matters are more complicated each day.
Our schools have benefited from the youth collaborative instigated by the cooperation of several state programs working with local schools.
Past funding was pulled with difficulty from a variety of federally funded programs.
Now we need your support to carry the collaborative with state funding.
Funding Last year, you authorized updates to the K-12 funding model one year ahead of schedule.
The school foundation guarantee will be recalculated with the updated MAP model and based on the latest calculation of average daily membership in our schools.
Current criticism of the MAP model and its update should not be directed at MAP.
They are only the messenger.
Their update is the result of the Wyoming Supreme Court mandate.
The MAP methodology is defensible in court.
It may not meet your expectations and it certainly doesn’t meet all of mine, particularly with the impact on small school districts.
I recommend that you hold the small districts harmless for two years from reductions in funding that may result from the MAP adjustments.
During this period of time, I would hope that the Court might find a way to remedy the unintended consequence that puts our small districts at risk.
The MAP product comes from individuals who are nationally known to be the best in their field.
They have given you a constitutional cost-based model.
The changes you will consider this year follow the Court mandated evaluations for increases in teacher salaries, provides seniority adjustments for administrators, updates for classified school employees, increases the block grant for programs for at-risk youth, as well as limited English speaking students and provides that Wyoming will be the first and only state in the nation to specifically fund a category for vocational education.
I look forward to the debate over the school finance amendments.
I trust that the bill that arrives downstairs for my signature will be based upon sound principals of data-driven decision making.
The last opinion handed down by the Wyoming Supreme Court introduced major problems – I’ll call them unintended consequences, since I doubt that our justices realized the impact of their decision.
The first is the result of the imposition of the regional cost adjustment by which 42 of our school districts lost a total of $22 million that must be reallocated to the other six districts, one of which received a 40 percent increase in funding.
The justices also expressed an opinion on school construction that introduces another confusing factor.
Their decision indicates that as long as the State furnishes the funding to construct the facilities necessary to deliver the basket of goods to students, local districts can use their own wealth to add enhancements to their school facility.
Using the Court’s own rationale, the Legislature could just as easily define the level of operational funding necessary to deliver the basket of goods and, as a policy matter, enhance the smaller districts’ funding above the required threshold.
Both of these problems illustrate how difficult policy and management decisions are when you draw conclusions in the relative sterility of the courthouse instead of in the schoolhouse.
In a recent article in Education Week magazine, Wyoming was cited as being second only to New Jersey in the “adequacy” of our resources applied to K-12 schools.
Over the past four years, you have authorized larger percentage increases in school funding than any other state.
The funding increases have also resulted in increases in teacher salaries greater than any other state.
All this has taken place at the same time that Wyoming student population has declined at a rate greater than any other state.
The seemingly endless discussion over money detracts from the true pursuit of excellence.
I have yearned many times over the past several years for a time when the energies of our state and educational leaders could be focused on the pursuit of excellence rather than the differences in dollars.
Money indeed matters, but it is not, nor has it ever been, an end unto itself.
The single most important message I can convey is that we should celebrate the progress we are making in public education.
Take heart in the work you have done over the past several years.
It is of high quality, and is providing Wyoming school children with great opportunities to make choices about their lives and their future careers.
School Construction We did not ask that the state make all the decisions regarding school construction but we now must implement the mandate to centralize decisions about the maintenance, renovation and replacement of Wyoming schools.
I support the creation of the School Facilities Commission to take on these new responsibilities.
Wyoming Equality Network and Technology With the connectivity of the Wyoming Equality Network, all of our public schools are linked to the Internet and to each other.
Instruction can now take place on any subject and in any of our Wyoming schools.
This semester, over 50 courses are available to high school students over the WEN.
Without it, students in smaller schools would not have access to upper level math, language and science courses.
However, we still need to make substantial new investments in professional development for our teachers and administrators so that they can effectively use the network.
As I visited our schools over the past few months, each high school was eager to implement the WEN classroom, but in many instances was unable to do so due to lack of a person to coordinate course development and scheduling.
In addition, we have a number of schools that are not connected with bandwidth capable of delivering course work and teacher lesson plans.
I ask for your support to enhance school connectivity and course scheduling.
We have purposely chosen the schools to infuse technology to inoculate our businesses that have been very slow to adapt to competing in the New Economy.
Our kids are finding out that technology enables self initiated, self-directed learning as a powerful learning skill that will serve them well in future academic studies as well as in the workplace.
What remains is our challenge to continue to develop our teaching core for recruitment, for retention for increasing their skills and their capabilities to teach.
Through innovative use of technology, Wyoming has made some notable headway in revolutionizing the state’s education system.
In September 2000, Wyoming became one of the first states to document the connection of every public school, even 11 one-room schoolhouses, to the Internet.
Since September 2000, our 400 schools and 89,000 students across 96,000 square miles of Wyoming have been connected via a telecommunications network, known as the Wyoming Equality Network, connected to the Internet and connected to each other.
Wyoming is the first state to have each school capable of interacting with any other school in the state.
Higher Education Your support of the tuition assistance program for Wyoming National Guard to improve skill and education levels and the overall readiness of the National Guard has been very popular and successful.
We have better trained and more motivated personnel as a result of your investment and have a much higher level of preparedness to support our military commitments.
I ask for your continuing support of tuition assistance.
I support a modest increase in state aid to our Community Colleges, although not at the full amount requested.
The Legislature did provide a substantial increase in appropriated funds in 2001, especially to improve salaries.
In addition, I recommend funds to cover the increased cost of health insurance premiums and utility cost increases.
I also recommend increased funding for workforce development coordination, for adult basic education, for administrative technology and for major maintenance.
I support the implementation of a formula to keep all learning facilities in at least fair condition.
Wyoming Public Television needs to upgrade its capability to digital format, which I support.
However, in recognition of your Management Audit Committee report, I recommend that we work to integrate Wyoming Public TV into our educational delivery systems in Wyoming and give it more specific responsibilities for distance learning.
The University of Wyoming has my support for substantial increases for faculty and staff compensation, a public affairs research center, for increased utility costs, and implementation of a major maintenance formula to keep facilities in at least a fair condition.
In addition, I support revenue bonds to provide matching funds for the new Health Sciences Center and the Technology Incubator.
During the 2001 Legislature, the public schools, community colleges and general government all received funding increases targeted at improving employee salaries.
The University of Wyoming did not receive similar increases.
I support their request to move both faculty and staff salaries closer to market.
Last March, you approved my supplemental budget request to allocate $30 million targeted to enhance UW endowments.
The University was given five years to come up with $30 million in matching funds.
With outstanding work by the University and overwhelming response to the challenge, in less than one year, our University supporters have already come up with $14.5 million or nearly half of the total you approved.
As previously indicated, I support legislation for several scholarship initiatives that target critical occupations facing shortages in the next few years.
These scholarships would be loans to students entering the study for those professions.
The loans would become grants if the graduate stays in Wyoming for a specific number of years in that profession.
In addition to addressing shortages in teaching and nursing or other critical occupations, our young people would start their professional lives in Wyoming and establish their homes in our communities.
Health Health care costs continue to increase at an alarming rate, both for state sponsored services and for private businesses and local government activities.
Increases of 30 to 40 percent for health insurance premiums are typical, with some private businesses experiencing 50 to 80 percent increases in coverage costs.
I convened an insurance review task force to evaluate what we could do to reverse the upward pressure on health insurance costs.
I support the task force conclusion that the issues are complex and need your review as an interim study over the next year.
The Wyoming Department of Health’s budget request was dominated by increases in the state’s Medicaid program for prescription drugs, client increases in several programs including the Kid Care program, adolescent in-patient mental health services, expansion of elderly programs such as assisted living and home and community based waiver, meeting the required increases for nursing home providers, trying to reduce the waiting lists for developmentally disabled adults and children, and the addition of rehabilitative services such as treatment of traumatic brain injuries.
I recommend that you reinstate funds for expanded community mental health services and for the State Hospital so that we can meet our court approved obligations to bring closure to the Chris S. litigation.
The Long-Term Care Reform Bill that you passed during the 2001 legislative session allows individuals to use Medicaid to stay in assisted living facilities or to receive services at home as an alternative to premature institutionalization.
This year you have a bill before you which addresses the rising costs of Medicaid reimbursed nursing home care.
Last year’s interim study came at a time when 11 of Wyoming's 39 nursing homes had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Today, 6 of the 11 are still in bankruptcy status.
Lack of adequate reimbursement plays a part in the status of these facilities.
The current reimbursement system has not been adjusted since 1994.
It's time to adjust the system.
Parts of our state struggle today to provide adequate health care including.
For instance, Niobrara County is declared a health care shortage area for primary care physicians, mental health professionals, and dental services.
The county does not have a facility today to take care of emergency situations.
Some of our next steps could focus on a telemedicine network between other hospitals and Lusk for diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury.
I support helping Lusk’s clinic to return to designation as a Critical Access Hospital, such as was done in Big Horn County.
The creation of Kid Care gave the state the ability to provide health insurance to more children of low-income families who are above the poverty level but below the income level where employer benefits are available.
Since you approved the Kid Care legislation in 1999, the program has helped 2,781 children.
I support funding for additional youth coverage in the next biennium.
Uninsured kids are more likely to go without needed medical or dental care.
This increases the risk for serious disease, drives up the overall cost of treatment and, in many cases, decreases opportunities for full recovery.
The uninsured are four times more likely to use the emergency room rather than make a routine office call in advance of the emergency and are more likely to need state funded services in the future that could otherwise have been prevented.
As Wyoming moves solidly into the twenty-first century, our local and state public health agencies continue to rise to the challenge to improve the quality of people’s lives by preventing disease, injury, and disability.
I support increasing our public health efforts to focus on prevention strategies that yield the greatest benefit for quality of life and budgetary investment.
Substance Abuse During my community visits to discuss our budget process and priorities, substance abuse was frequently mentioned as a major concern of our citizens.
We must reverse the growing trend of substance abuse by all people, but especially among our youth.
Your subcommittee, tasked with developing a plan to eliminate substance abuse, has estimated that $25 million will be needed during this budget period to implement the plan.
I support the use of tobacco settlement funds for start-up funding.
As substance abuse is decreased, there will be reduced incidence of adults being incarcerated or of out-of-home placement of juveniles.
Proper investment today will reduce expenditures on prison cells and juvenile detention later.
While the substance abuse plan will define the state’s role in dealing with demand reduction as well as more effective treatment, the most effective means of dealing with substance abuse is still prevention.
The avoidance of illegal substances is the responsibility of every citizen in Wyoming.
We need to change our culture.
The most widely abused substance, particularly by youth, is alcohol.
We must do more to eliminate or at least discourage irresponsible use.
I support lowering the legal limit for intoxication to 0.08-blood alcohol content.
But, there are also disturbing trends of increasing use of other drugs such as methamphetamine and ecstasy.
Our culture still conveys the message that having a kegger or a rave party is all just a part of growing up.
Far too many adults, especially parents, say “Let them learn what it’s like.
We all did the same thing when we were kids.
It’s just a rite of passage to adulthood.
If we adults don’t care, why should the kids care?
That needs to change.
We are spending far too many dollars for state programs just for drug interdiction and treatment, but those costs pale in comparison to the economic impact of drugs and alcohol in our communities.
No community is exempt, whether large or small.
Lyman and Moorcroft are just as susceptible to drugs as Cheyenne and Casper.
We must recognize that there is more to combating the problem of substance abuse than just focusing on the supply side.
The only way to win this war is to also address the demand side of the equation.
We need to change our culture and our attitudes toward substance abuse.
We have had success in dealing with substance abuse through the Drug Courts that you established.
These emphasize supervision and treatment rather than incarceration as a lower cost and more effective alternative.
I support continued funding.
In addition, I am pleased with the results achieved by our Domestic Violence Elimination Council, or DoVE.
This Council continues to proactively address domestic violence issues in every community, many of which are the direct result of substance abuse.
The State of Wyoming has made a significant turn-around in youth sales of tobacco to minors.
In 1999, Wyoming's non-compliance rate for selling tobacco to minors was 55 percent.
This means that 55 out of 100 Wyoming youth were able to go to a store and buy tobacco products.
This startling statistic caused the implementation of a successful campaign of outreach with the cooperation of retailers to assist in the reduction of tobacco sales to Wyoming's youth.
Due to these efforts, today only 10 out of 100 Wyoming youth gain access to tobacco products in stores.
Wyoming is no longer subject to federal penalties to our substance abuse block grant.
Public Safety/ Corrections The single largest part of public safety as a category is our Corrections program, which fulfills its obligations to the public through reasonable, safe, secure and humane management of offenders while providing opportunities for the offenders to become useful members of society.
The first element of public safety is to impose a consequence for illegal behavior or actions.
Punishment is required by law and applied in the right context.
The next element is to guide the offender to remorse and to accept personal responsibility for wrong actions.
That leads to restitution by the offender to the victim, if that’s possible, and/or to the community affected by the offender.
The last step is to engage the offender in a program of rehabilitation.
This system of Restorative Justice is practiced throughout our corrections system.
Our goal is to effect enough change in criminal behavior such that the need for expensive prison beds decreases as the number of repeat offenders decreases.
My budget focuses on putting the offender in the least restrictive setting commensurate with risk and resources.
I support increases in Field Services and community supervision programs to bring the caseload per worker down to a manageable level.
Programs such as probation, parole, adult community corrections and the intensive supervision program are lower cost programs and make the offender face the consequences of wrong actions in a setting where victim and community restitution can occur.
I support increases in the intensive treatment units at both the men and women’s prisons as a more effective means to rehabilitate the offender as he or she is transitioned back into the community.
Ideally, we should have all male and female offenders confined within the state for the most effective management and coordination of programs.
The cost to rehabilitate the North Facility in Rawlins and the cost to expand the Women’s Center in Lusk are beyond our means for the time being, so the present method of contracting for beds is a practical and economical alternative.
Eventually, reduced recidivism and placement of lower risk offenders in other settings such as the Honor Farm, the Honor Conservation Camp and in community settings will reduce the need for more facilities.
I recommend that we continue the current instate and out-of-state placements of both men and women inmates for the next biennium.
There is a serious work to be done in prisoner management.
I recognize the prison’s economic impact on Rawlins and we will continue to work with the community.
With the new South Facility, there was a net increase in employment and wages for the community.
We are not going to make choices on any biases or presumptions.
We are here to do the job right.
Family Services The principal Family Services programs include services to youth and to families in need of temporary assistance.
With your support we will continue to promote the preservation of Wyoming’s families and encourage individuals to improve their quality of life through personal responsibility, independence and self-worth under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, known as TANF.
We now have 12 one-stop employment and training offices to improve service delivery to customers.
Additional one-stop offices in the state are planned.
The number of clients on welfare has declined dramatically since 1995 reflecting the placement of clients in education programs or jobs.
The opposite trend is happening in services to youth who are abused or neglected or who are engaged in illegal activities.
Out-of-home placements of youth continue to increase.
Of major concern is the rate of child abuse, neglect or youth in crisis.
Equally troublesome is the continuing rate of substance abuse by youth.
I recommend increases for child protective services, for community crisis beds, and court-ordered placements.
The number of youth in custody or receiving court-ordered treatment has increased substantially.
Since the modification of state laws appointing multi-disciplinary teams to recommend youth treatment, Wyoming communities have recommended a much greater number of placements and services for youth caught up in the legal system.
I have tasked the Wyoming Department of Family Services to work with their providers, the community multi-disciplinary teams and the Judiciary to closely evaluate our investment in juvenile services, to analyze whether we have a shortage of prevention programs and why Wyoming continues to have one of the highest rates of youth substance abuse.
They will also consider whether we are overcompensating to try to eliminate all youth behavior risks through state action rather than through family and community actions.
Finally, they will consider the effect of turnover in social service workers within the Department and evaluate whether children are spending too much time in temporary placement waiting for adoption or other permanent and safe alternatives.
Solutions in any or every one of these areas are needed to reduce the causes that lead to the high cost of placements.
NATURAL RESOURCES From wildlife to federal land management to agriculture, the State of Wyoming continues to find ways to work together with local government, conservation districts and the federal government.
Natural resource industries are a significant part of Wyoming’s economy.
I support continued efforts to add value to natural resource products while at the same time conserving for the next generation.
Since the start of my administration, our goals have been to develop cooperation among federal, state and local government and to balance the environment with safe, clean development of our natural resources.
Wildlife Wyoming along with other states in the West shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of compliance with the Endangered Species Act.
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is currently working to develop recovery and management plans for eight threatened and endangered species at an annual cost of $700,000.
In addition, the Department must evaluate another 70 species that are under consideration for listing as threatened or endangered.
Beyond that, as many as 400 other plant and animal species are being evaluated for conservation plans or possible listing.
The Game and Fish Department is obligated to fund these evaluations and plans primarily with the license fees paid by sportsmen and women.
Their fees should be going toward the consumptive wildlife enhancement programs in the state, but are being diverted to benefit an entire nation.
We need funding alternatives to support these activities.
One alternative would be to allocate state general fund dollars to the Department and place its budget under legislative review.
That may cause the Department to lose some of its autonomy.
The other alternative would be to find a source of funding that would retain management independence.
The Wyoming Wildlife Legacy Trust concept has my support.
Funds would be placed in a permanent trust to earn investment income that could be spent on species evaluation and recovery.
Federal Land Management Wyoming was the first state under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to receive cooperating agency status when the National Park Service included Wyoming liaison position, data sharing agreements, habitat conservation plans for multiple species under the endangered species act and coordination of informational links for tourism in the development of the Yellowstone Winter Use Environmental Impact Statement.
We were able to also have Idaho and Montana named as cooperating agencies along with gateway counties.
Wyoming was also the first state to be included as a full partner by the U. S. Forest Service when the state participated in the Medicine Bow revision plans.
When Wyoming asked surrounding counties to join the Powder River Basin environmental impact study, Wyoming was the first state to share its cooperating agency status with local entities.
The state again shared this status with counties during the Bighorn National Forest revision plans.
Wyoming is now looked to nationally as being the model for best practices on dealing with federal land management processes successfully.
On January 30th, just over a week ago, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a directive to all federal agencies.
According to Jim Connaughton, Chairman of CEQ, this directive will require federal agencies to address the inclusion of states as cooperating agencies on all NEPA actions.
The directive came as a result of the precedent that Wyoming had set.
I support continuing participation by counties and conservation districts in the state's cooperating agency status or by requesting their own individual status.
Being a cooperating agency takes a substantial investment of both personnel and funding.
I am recommending that the Natural Resources Policy Account, which was established to coordinate, cooperate, and communicate with the federal government on natural resource management policies, be increased by an additional $375,000 to assist county commissions and conservation districts to fully participate as cooperating agencies.
I have continued my tradition of annual meetings among federal resource managers and Wyoming state agencies that have responsibilities for resource management to discuss issues of mutual concern.
I called the gathering the “Governor’s Kitchen Table” after the productive discussions that typically occur around the kitchen table over a cup of coffee in the West.
Tangible products from these meetings include the creation of the U. S. Forest Service – State of Wyoming liaison position, data sharing agreements, habitat conservation plans for multiple species under the endangered species act and coordination of informational links for tourism.
Passing along respect and understanding for our natural resources to our youth is important.
My administration has encouraged the development of educational programs that involve natural resource management, technology and community service.
For the past several years, I have taken proceeds that come from the Governor’s Complimentary Hunting Licenses to fund the Youth Initiative for Wildlife and Natural Resource Conservation.
To date, over 25 youth wildlife and natural resource conservation projects have received funding.
Agribusiness Agriculture is one of the top three industries in Wyoming.
This administration recognizes its impact on the state’s economy and has closely worked with the Legislature and the state’s agriculture community to meet its needs.
Among our recent successes are the formation of marketing cooperatives, Animal Damage Management Board, the food safety program and ongoing efforts to improve agriculture education and leadership opportunities.
Two of those recent legislative enactments have other states looking at Wyoming’s business friendly, cooperative structure.
The first one gave agriculture producers the ability to file liens that would reduce their exposure to large company bankruptcy filings.
The second legislative effort established Wyoming as the premier state for a new approach to processing and marketing cooperatives.
Already the Mountain States Lamb and Wool Cooperative has formalized a marketing relationship with Faribault Woolen Mills of Minnesota and has partnered with B. Rosen & Sons, Inc. a leading supplier of fabricated lamb meat and products.
With these joint ventures, the cooperative will be able to add value to their wool and will be able to vertically integrate having control of the product from the time it is produced to when it reaches the consumer.
The Legislature established an Animal Damage Management Board.
I appointed representatives from agriculture, sportsmen, and the environmental community to evaluate, promote, and implement innovative techniques of predator management and research.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given Wyoming high praise for our food safety program and have recommended our approach as a model program for food safety for the rest of the country.
We continue to improve agriculture education and leadership.
Agriculture in the Classroom has developed innovative teaching tools in compliance with state education standards.
The Wyoming State Fair is the premier agriculture educational event for all citizens in Wyoming.
I continue to support the re-vitalization of the LEAD program, which educates and trains leaders for a strong agriculture community.
The Wyoming Business Council administers the program.
REDISTRICTING One of the reasons why the leadership and I agreed to call this special session was to give you more flexibility to complete the monumental task of redistricting, in addition to education reform and the state's budget.
"The Wyoming Constitution, as amended in 1998, requires that ""at the first budget session of the legislature following the federal census, the legislature shall reapportion its membership based upon that census."
I do anticipate that you will enact legislation that is objective and purposeful.
HOMELAND SECURITY The effects of September 11th linger on.
The need to provide Homeland Security even in Wyoming leaves us with uncertainty over what future acts may yet occur that would require additional effort and expenditure by the state.
We have responded to the President’s call for help to fight terrorism and to protect our homeland.
I continue to support the deployment of our Army and Air National Guard units on a wide variety of missions.
Some are involved with war missions in and near Afghanistan.
Some are engaged in humanitarian aid in the same areas.
Others are protecting our airports and armories.
Several are involved as security police at active duty installations.
We have a special contingent assigned to protect the Olympics that started just last Friday in Salt Lake City.
All together, Wyoming has sent 220 Army Guard members and 304 Air Guard members for a total of 524 highly capable men and women.
This represents the largest deployment of our Wyoming military since the Korean War.
During ANY disaster or emergency situation, citizens look to the government closest to them for immediate response, the government in our home towns.
Local government is the government of first response, for public safety response, utilities, emergency housing, recovery and clean-up and to provide personal comfort, counseling and consolation.
Immediately after the terrorist attacks on September 11th, I formed the Wyoming Counter Terrorism Commission, which has completed their initial report on Wyoming’s readiness to handle terrorism.
The work of the Commission continues, implementing the recommendations of the report.
I support the package of bills being put forward by the Commission to address solutions to immediate and long-term concerns with foreign and domestic terrorism: mutual aid in law enforcement; fire protection and emergency services; the Emergency Management Assistance Compact; the Hazardous Materials Response Act; victims’ compensation for victims of terrorism in America; and making it a crime to knowingly perpetrate hoax threats of biological terrorism.
I also support the Commission’s recommendation for the Wyoming Department of Transportation’s study regarding a wireless public safety communications system that would serve all of the public safety and law enforcement agencies in our state.
This must be a high priority.
Available bandwidths are disappearing.
As we all watched the recovery efforts after 9-11, our respect for firemen and policemen was spontaneous and strong.
They are the first responders to any kind of attack, whether by terrorist or by criminals.
To encourage their service and to enable the recruitment of replacement law enforcement officials, I support the Joint Judiciary Committee’s bill on Law Enforcement Retirement.
The amount to fund the combined system could be spread over a period of time to accommodate our budget constraints.
Wyoming is as well prepared as any nearby state due to decisions made three and four years ago.
These decisions have prepared us to prevent and to respond to bioterrorism and other acts of terrorism.
I support modest increases in Health and our Capitol Protective Services to enhance our preparedness.
Several federal cabinet officials including the Director of Health and Human Services, the Director of Homeland Security, the U. S. Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have each asked us to provide training, assessment and response capabilities for a variety of situations, including personnel investigations, water treatment plants, energy facilities, protecting the public health from disease through surveillance and laboratory testing as well as being prepared to provide immediate response and treatment on a regional basis, such as for the Winter Olympics.
We have met all of these requests, most even in advance of being asked.
I was privileged to represent all the nations governors at a special presentation of a check to help states fund health related responses to bioterrorism and other crises.
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson presented me with a Wyoming specific check for over $6.5 million to aid in implementing our greatest priority to bolster our public health system capacity.
GlobalOptions, a well-known international security consultant, hired last April to evaluate security in our Capitol Complex area, delivered their report in December regarding workplace safety and potential threats from domestic and international terrorism.
They outlined what we might do to minimize risk and to enhance the security of those who work in or visit within the buildings in our Capitol Complex.
The report included procedures, personnel and facilities improvements to provide greater protection for our employees, clients, legislators, staff and visitors.
GlobalOptions recommended that just to get the basics in place, the cost of personnel, hardware, software and construction would total $8.2 million.
While I strongly support the conclusions and recommendations presented to us, I am recommending that we invest at least $2.8 million to get just the bare essentials in place.
Interestingly enough, one of the most common concerns expressed by visitors to our Capitol is that there isn’t enough security for either the people who work here or for those who visit here.
Our Capitol Protective Services personnel under the Wyoming Highway Patrol have already taken on many duties above those contemplated by you in the Legislature when you authorized the unit in last year’s session.
As an example, the Supreme Court has requested service during all of its court sessions held in public.
Your continued support and funding are needed.
USA FREEDOM CORPS During the days, weeks and months following September 11th, the most common request I heard from the people of Wyoming was “What can I do to help?” Some donated blood.
Some went to New York to help with the recovery efforts.
Many people just felt unfulfilled in wanting to reach out, to respond to their rekindled set of values.
That same reaction reached the White House.
In his State of the Union Address, President Bush called on all Americans to serve their nation for the equivalent of two years (4,000 hours) over their lifetimes, and announced a major new citizen service initiative – the USA Freedom Corps.
I will be working through our state agencies and local communities to implement the purpose and intent of the Freedom Corps as outlined in the President’s Executive Order.
The Citizen Corps will implement a range of new initiatives to engage ordinary Americans in specific homeland security efforts in their own communities.
Citizen Corps initiatives include the creation of a Medical Reserve Corps, a Volunteers in Police Service (VIPS) program and a Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS) – as well as a doubling of the Neighborhood Watch program, and a tripling of the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program.
The AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs will be expanded and reformed to engage thousands of new volunteers in effective, community-based service opportunities.
As we work to engage each other in community service and homeland security, we can each look back to how our spirit and our values were revived in the aftermath of 9-11.
Wyoming’s Special Lady During each of my State of the State Addresses, I've introduced to you to Wyoming’s First Lady, Sherri Geringer, known to the school kids as “Mrs.
G. Today, I want to share with you some of the work she has done for Wyoming.
The First Lady focuses on concerns involving children and families, a natural outgrowth of her own personal interests and devotion to her family.
She serves on the Governor’s Early Childhood Development Council and is the spokesperson for the Help Me Grow/Safe Kids Coalition to prevent child abuse and care for kids who are victims of abuse.
Her most recent initiative is “Raising Readers in Wyoming,” a program that aims to provide books to children from birth to age five.
Sherri has visited scores of schools throughout the state reading to children and promoting literacy since, as a strong proponent of quality education, she knows how important it is for young children to be able to read.
Sherri is a dedicated advocate for early detection of breast cancer and is the founder and honorary chair of Wyoming’s Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation’s Race for the Cure.
She also is a leader in the fight against domestic violence and child abuse.
She serves on the steering committee of Leadership to Keep Children Alcohol Free, a national initiative supported by other governors’ spouses to help prevent underage drinking.
Last year, as chair of Wyoming’s celebration of the new millennium, the First Lady published Dear Mrs. G. a compilation of Wyoming students’ vision of their state in 2025, and I Remember When, a living history recorded by Wyoming’s centenarians.
Her familiar voice on various radio spots recounted Wyoming’s millennial moments.
Her support for arts in our schools resulted in the Wyoming Children’s Discovery Park on a one-third-acre portion of the governor’s residence grounds.
The park is a legacy of her commitment to education and is a showcase of bronze sculptures created by high school students from all over Wyoming.
She has helped Habitat for Humanity to build a home for a young lady in Casper.
This is all in addition to her full time job as Mom, Grandma and the only unpaid director of a major state agency.
My partner, Sherri.
Closing The overall approach that I have taken in governing has been to focus on community-based solutions and encourage the development of technology that enhances people’s ability to participate in the new economy and in society.
All the accomplishments achieved during the last seven years can be traced back to working hand in hand with the Wyoming Legislature, elected officials and local communities, the people of Wyoming.
Wyoming has moved a long way.
We have enhanced the number of jobs.
We have pointed Wyoming toward the New Economy.
We have focused on community-based services in the people sensitive areas.
We have even settled most of the lawsuits that I inherited when I first came into office.
I know I have asked a lot of you this morning - a lot from this Legislature and a lot from the people of Wyoming.
By working together, we already have a great track record proving that we can meet every challenge.
We will ensure that Wyoming remains the Last Best Place in America to live and raise a family.
Last week, Candy Vasko, the Student Body President at Torrington High School, asked me what had changed most in my life as a result of September 11th.
I answered that what had changed most for me was how much the people around us had changed.
Before September 11th, disrespect had become the hallmark of personal and political interaction.
After September 11th, we came together, each wanting in some way to help, to look after each other, to get involved even at the risk of personal sacrifice and to rediscover that faith and values matter.
On September 11th, we became a nation once again.
We have come this far by faith and persistence.
May God continue to bless Wyoming and the United States of America!
