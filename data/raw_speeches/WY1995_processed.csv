SENTENCES
My office is directly below the spot where I stand today.
I have a view out both the south and the east windows.
Each by itself presents an interesting perspective of the world.
To the south is the view of the Supreme Court building with its great expanse of open lawns and stately trees.
"The Justices come and go, seldom rushed, lost in deep thought as they weigh the matters and elegance of laws."
Some parts of government are like that.
Agencies contemplate the elegance of their programs and are not aware of their surroundings.
"To the east, my view is mostly of busy Central Avenue, a one way boulevard that carries a constant stream of automobiles."
They press on to their drivers' destinations with intensity and urgency.
I'm not sure they know where they are going but they move with assurance.
Wyoming has other government programs that also have that characteristic.
The programs are like the drivers.
Government knows how to fund the programs.
The outcome or destination isn't always clear but there's an urgency in getting there.
We are here today to contemplate the state of the state.
"My duty as governor is to tell you of the current condition of the state, particularly its government."
"Further, I am bound to tell you the directions we should take from today on.This is where we are Today."
This is what we must do Tomorrow.
This is how we will do it Together.
My focus starts with self determination.Controlling our own destiny.
"States Rights When I came to this chamber as a freshman Representative from Platte County twelve years ago, some of the issues were a bit different."
"Then we were just beginning to be concerned about diversifying the state's economy, and we were struggling to assure equal pay for equal work."
"One issue though, has remained constant over many years: state sovereignty."
"Together as legislators, we have chafed under the increasing imbalance of power between federal and state governments."
The framers of the United States Constitution envisioned shared sovereignty.
"They intended for the states to assume responsibility for education, law enforcement, health care, public lands, and the like."
"Federal government, they intended to be limited to serving the common needs of the states."
"As explicitly expressed in the Constitution, federal government provides for such necessities as national defense, federal judiciary, national currency, and interstate commerce."
The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution is clear in its delineation of power.
It declares that powers not designated in the Constitution to the federal government are reserved to the states or to the people.
"Beginning in the early decades of this century, however, the federal government has assumed an increasingly more powerful role, encroaching on the rights of the states and the rights of the people."
"In this last decade of the 20th century, federal mandates--funded and unfunded--have the effect of dictating how our public institutions should be operated."
"Health care, education, law enforcement and public lands are managed by federal priorities, not ours."
"By imposing unfunded or only partially funded mandates, the federal government levies an intolerable burden on the taxpayers of the state."
"Building on Agenda of United States Congress The Congress of the United States, including the Wyoming delegation have accepted the charge to give relief to the states."
Members of both the House and the Senate are committed to prohibiting unfunded mandates.
We wish them well and we will monitor their progress.
"At the same time, we are monitoring the progress of the balanced budget amendment, the first bill in the Contract with America package introduced in the House."
I am concerned about unintended consequences of this otherwise good idea.
A balanced budget amendment would force the Congress to live with its means.
"But if the Congress votes to balance its budget without voting to reduce its programs, the states will continue to stagger under the weight of mandates imposed by Congress."
Eliminating mandates must be a top priority.
The Senate leadership has already to introduced mandate relief as Bill SF - 1.
"Conference of the States Besides working with our Congressional delegation, Wyoming is proceeding on another front to seek reassertion of state sovereignty."
I recommend that the State of Wyoming join with other states in participating in the Conference of the States planned for the fall of 1995.
I urge that the Legislature pass the Resolution of Participation in the Conference of the States.
"Our participation would call for four Legislators--two from each party, two from each chamber- -to accompany me to the Conference to represent Wyoming in drafting a States' Petition that would represent the collective will of the states."
"The Conference of the States will be an opportunity for the states to define, distinctly and thoughtfully, the proper relationship between state and federal government."
It will be a forum to deliberate a realignment of responsibility in light of governance challenges in the 21st century.
The resulting states' petition drafted under the procedures of deliberative democracy will give the United States Congress the working document that will enable restoration of balance in the federal system.
"New Standard for Participation in Discretionary Federal Programs As we struggle to find the appropriate relationship between federal and state government in modern times, we must be mindful of our own inadvertent abdication of responsibility as a sovereign state."
Often Wyoming accepts federal money and the mandates that accompany the use of the money for new programs.
"In the past, the State of Wyoming has accepted money from Washington for discretionary programs when those programs may only be marginally relevant to Wyoming's needs."
We have tried to use federal dollars for programs that were designed for locations and situations completely unlike those in Wyoming.
A program that was meant for Detroit does not work for Big Piney.
"We not only make awkward compromises, we waste money."
"We take the funds, often just seed money, and are left with the mandate to provide future funding out of state resources."
Today I issue a call for state responsibility.
"I call for a new standard for participation in non-mandatory federal programs: Absent federal dollars, would the state adopt the program?"
Relevance and appropriateness will be the criteria.
"Economic Development Because of its economic stability and predictability, Wyoming offers many advantages to existing businesses, business start-ups or business searching for a new location."
"Wyoming is growing steadily, has no state corporate taxes, and has an enviable quality of life."
"The challenges that we face for providing employment for our young people begins with meeting challenges of infrastructure, continued development of our traditional economy, adding value to our resources, and broadening professional choices with new technology."
"As emphasized already, telecommunications is critical to attracting and retaining highly capitalized, clean industries that will increase Wyoming banks' loan to deposit ratio and provide higher pay jobs."
"We will proceed thoughtfully, but aggressively, to build a telecommunications system that insures a bright economic future."
"Minerals Wyoming's coal, oil, trona, helium and natural gas reserves are world class."
Our economy and revenues are fueled by mineral production.
"I call your attention to the CREG reports, which confirm again what we all know."
Wyoming's revenues are dependent on minerals production.
It is incumbent on us to promote and encourage the development of our mineral resources in order to assure our economic health.
We should never apologize for supporting the responsible development of our vast mineral resources.
"Today, oil and gas production accounts for 35% of the total taxable value of Wyoming."
Ten years ago that figure was almost 55%.
"Left unchecked, further erosion of our state's petroleum tax base will cause extreme hardships through the loss of tax revenues and employment opportunities."
I invite industry leaders to participate in a new partnership for Wyoming - work sessions to prioritize industries needs and develop policies based on those needs.
"State mineral and energy policy will drive research investments, develop new markets, and solve transportation, communication and regulatory problems."
"I will direct the Department of Commerce, STEA, the University of Wyoming, the Director of Public Lands and other agencies to convene these high level work sessions, perform the research, plan the strategies and do the work necessary to meet these planning goals."
"Among my priorities are the following: 1) Encourage the search for new reserves: If America would apply its collective will and convert its national transportation fuel from foreign oil to domestic natural gas, this Nation would be well on its way to becoming energy self-sufficient early in the 21st century."
"Wyoming, of course, is positioned to become a major supplier."
"At the University of Wyoming's Institute for Energy Research, research is directed at developing innovative exploration and production strategies."
"With an eye toward increased production, I am proposing a severance tax credit on natural gas production for taxpayers who fund research which is specifically directed toward increasing gas production in Wyoming."
"To qualify for the tax credit, the research must be certified by the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission as important to the Wyoming gas industry."
The short-term goal of the bill is to offset lost state revenue due to decreased oil production by increasing gas production.
"The long-term goal of the bill is to continuously increase gas production, thereby insuring stable or increasing state revenues."
"2) Maximize the recovery of known reserves and avoid premature abandonment of older, marginal properties; The recovery of minerals from high cost properties is particularly important at this point in our mineral production history."
"When Wyoming's tax structure impedes the recovery of the resource from marginal properties, tax incentives are appropriate."
"However, incentives should be incentives, not disguised tax reductions."
"I will support only those tax incentives which have a clearly defined objective, measure the incentive's ability to meet that objective, and quantify the lost opportunity for short term revenue by setting production targets for long term gains in revenue due to increased production."
3) Foster opportunities to add value to our raw mineral resources; New opportunities to add value to our minerals before they leave the state are a high priority.
Coal and trona are particularly attractive candidates for enhancement.
"While government's role in this issue is to assist industry, I intend to nudge industry to play a larger part in bringing value-added technologies to commercialization in Wyoming."
4) Increase state involvement in the federal decision making process which directly encroaches on our traditional economic base and lifestyle: The federal government owns two of every three subsurface mineral acres in our State.
"Based on data from the Bureau of Mines, access to 27% of the Federal lands that most likely contain locatable minerals is moderately to severely restricted."
Many areas are placed off-limits without reliable information about the potential for mineralization in those areas.
"Access to 29% of the potential oil and gas lands, 20% of the coal lands, 50% of the phosphate lands and 61% of the trona lands is moderately to severely restricted."
"While some restrictions are legislated, many are management related."
The potential for mineral resource development needs to be examined before lands are placed off limits.
This problem will only get worse if it is not met head-on at the highest level of state government.
"I will assemble my top natural resource advisors to actively promote and defend our basic industries, to trouble shoot, and to ensure federal performance."
Today let us serve notice together - Wyoming will no longer acquiesce to edicts from Federal agencies.
"5) Examine state regulatory practices which are ambiguous, unnecessary or counterproductive: While we criticize the Federal government for its impractical and burdensome regulations, frequently state management decisions, and agency policies and rules are not routed among the various state agencies for organized review."
Some of these unilateral decisions have had significant impacts on the accessibility and the development of our mineral resources.
I have instructed my Cabinet members with interconnected responsibilities to work in teams to resolve common problems.
"There will be better coordination between state and federal agencies, such as the BLM and our State Historic Preservation Office on archeological and historic resources issues."
"On the regulatory side, we will assist business development by ensuring regulatory compliance at the least cost in time and money."
We will establish aggressive time frames to perform each stage of permitting.
"Even a firm answer of ""permit denied"" is better for a permit applicant then the months many applicants spend in permit limbo-land."
"Finally, we will review our regulations and statutes in the months ahead, eliminating the needless but ever mindful of the obligation we have to our people and our environment."
"Tourism, Recreation and International Trade We will continue to develop and support tourism and recreation not only as service for Wyoming people , but as a way to attract entrepreneurs."
Many of our recent business success stories start with a vacation or recreation-related visit by a business owner or corporate executive.
Tourism will play a major part in our efforts to develop an international trade strategy as well.
"Wyoming has enjoyed phenomenal growth in international tourism over the six years, particularly from Europe."
"By several accounts, more than 30 per cent of Cody's tourist business is now international."
"In the new international trade atmosphere made possible by the passage of NAFTA and GATT, Wyoming must become a smart player in the international trade arena."
"Accordingly, I am directing Wyoming's Department of Commerce to develop an international trade strategy to assure that Wyoming products and commodities have access to world markets."
"Arts and Humanities Just as the majority of Wyoming people actively participate in our recreation opportunities, so do a significant majority appreciate and enrich their lives with art and humanities programs."
Wyoming artists and programs focusing on ideas will find warm support in the Geringer administration.
Art is as much a part of our economic base as it is our cultural base.
"For example, I am reviewing plans to expand the Governor's Arts Awards and look forward to further discussions and to making an announcement soon."
State-based Manufacturing -- QVC Many Wyoming products will enjoy the assistance of state government in marketing.
"One opportunity that is coming soon is Wyoming's participation in a nationally broadcast marketing program--Quality, Value, Convenience, Inc. better known as QVC."
QVC is conducting a 50 week 50 state tour to extend high visibility to small manufacturers.
"QVC is the nation's largest electronic retailer, and it will come to Wyoming in the late spring to select finalists for promotion."
The broadcast marketing program is for state-made products not currently available on a national basis.
It is a live telecast from Wyoming to QVC's distribution in 50 million homes.
The Department of Commerce will soon be issuing information and a broad invitation to Wyoming's small manufacturers acquainting them with the requirements and encouraging them to participate.
"Governor's Economic Action Initiative Indeed, getting Wyoming's economy moving in a positive, vigorous direction is critical."
"Expanding tourism, developing an international trade strategy, focusing minerals policy and support, developing a strategic research investment policy--all demand coordination among government entities and with industry and higher education."
"To facilitate the strategizing, I am beginning a Governor's Economic Action Initiative that will insure that the many interests are conferring with one another and coordinating their efforts."
"STEA--the Science, Technology and Energy Authority--will be central in this initiative."
The purpose will be to develop strategies to expand the tax base and economy of the state and create jobs at a higher income level than the national average.
"The initiative will utilize several levels of activity, including a economic coordinating council, working groups, ad hoc task forces, and periodic conferences."
I will be inviting members of the legislature and citizens across the state to help in this effort so vital to our and our children's future.
"Property Tax Throughout the 1980's, the Legislature and county and state officials struggled with the challenges of the statewide mass reappraisal of residential property."
"In 1990, for the first time since 1967, all residential property was valued at its current fair market value."
"Some among us remember the great debates over a tier system of taxation vs. a uniform assessment factor, led by two of the finest Legislators I ever served with - Bob Frisby and Ron Micheli."
"Those battles were hard fought but have produced a locally assessed property tax system which is fair and equitable to most, but not all, property owners."
"Circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer sometimes cause property taxes to spiral, an experience which has caused some residents of Northwest Wyoming to seek redress from the Legislature."
"I commend to your attention two pieces of legislation which preserve our Constitutional protections of equal and uniform taxation, - 1) the Truth in Taxation bill which protects our fair market values and uniform assessment factor while focusing attention on the third and frequently overlooked element of our tax formula, the mill levying process; and 2) the Area of Economic Impact proposal, a property designation which will protect affected taxpayers from extreme swings in property taxes which are cause by external factors."
Health Provisions The health care debate has occupied center stage on the national agenda for the past two years.
"With the threat of federal legislation -- and inherent mandates -- facing the states, my predecessor appointed the Governor's Health Reform Commission to craft a ""Wyoming solution"" for our health care needs."
"But as we recognize the need for health care reform, we must recognize that in Wyoming we are blessed with an excellent health care system overall."
We can be proud of what we do for our citizens.
"My health care agenda emphasizes personal responsibility, and private sector opportunity."
We also know the State can do a better job in providing choices and opportunity than the federal government.
Health insurance reform is probably the area in which we can make the most immediate and significant impact.
The reforms will make it easier for people to change jobs without losing their insurance or without being again subjected to pre-existing condition exclusions.
Other proposals before you build upon the successes of the small group reforms the Legislature passed in 1992.
"They are designed to have a positive impact on the marketplace, making coverage accessible for more people by expanding the law to cover employers with up to 50 employees."
"In a State where ""small businesses"" are the backbone of our communities, these changes will benefit small businesses and their employees -- enable the private sector to more effectively compete with businesses in other states."
I supporting funding and expanding the duties of the Office of Rural Health -- another of the commission's recommendations.
"The legislature created the Office to serve as a clearinghouse for information on primary care services, to provide technical assistance to communities, and to establish a loan repayment program for physicians and other health professionals."
The Office of Rural Health will be asked to coordinate the development of a statewide telemedicine capability; assist in the establishment of Rural Health Clinics; asses the availability and training needs of nurse practitioners and physician's assistants; provide technical assistance to Wyoming hospitals; monitor federal rules and regulations; and establish and implement a Community Health Access Initiative.
These initiatives allow the government to empower the private sector without creating government bureaucracy.
I also encourage your support for Tort reform.
"The ever-increasing numbers of lawsuits take an enormous tolls on our health care system generally, and physicians specifically."
I support a reform package that promotes an alternative dispute resolution process.
We need to promise an avenue that diminishes the urge to litigate and promotes a fair resolution.
"I am also supportive of proposed legislation dealing with PPO statute amendments, and the updating of our HMO statutes."
You will also consider increased funding for Wyoming's trauma care system.
Injury is the number one cause of death for ages one through 44.
"And in a sparsely populated frontier state like Wyoming, emergency care is critical."
I urge your favorable consideration of this bill.
Government's role in every area is to provide the infrastructure through which the private sector has room to function and grow.
We have an obligation to create a health care infrastructure -- much like our obligation to build roads and develop telecommunications systems.
"Your energetic attention to the health care agenda this session will develop that infrastructure -- and make life better, safer and healthier for all our citizens."
Telecommunications Knowledge is the key to the increasingly sophisticated national -- and global -- economy in which Wyoming must compete.
"Telecommunications can give us better access to information, and the ability to use it more effectively."
It can help increase our productivity.
"A modern, state-of-the- art telecommunications system is essential if business, education, health care and government are to go beyond simple survival."
"Your Interim Corporations Committee has sponsored legislation that provides regulatory flexibility for telecommunications providers, and encourages innovation, as well as the use of new technology and services."
The final result must be a product that gives Wyoming's utilities and the Public Service Commission the flexibility to respond positively to the rapid changes facing various industries in the state.
"As we speak, this bill is indeed a ""work in progress""."
"I encourage all parties -- the legislature and the industry to work together to create a bill that will move Wyoming forward, with an eye toward the needs of Wyoming consumers today and tomorrow."
This is an important opportunity.
We must actively encourage a spirit of cooperation among those who will continue to build and improve the modern telecommunications system that Wyoming needs.
"The work will not be easy, but it is work that must be successfully completed."
All of us -- in the public and private sectors -- must actively seek ways to work cooperatively and constructively -- to seek common ground upon which to build our technological future.
This session I will also nominate an individual to serve on the Public Service Commission.
That appointment is critical to the progress we seek.
"In an ever-changing technological world, our Public Service Commission must be empowered to meet those changes."
"I will send you the name of an individual who will be qualified to meet those challenges, and I urge the legislature to provide the PSC with the necessary flexibility."
Government Accountability I intend to make use of the cabinet.
I have convened the cabinet once already and have outlined my expectations.
I will bring the names of my nominees to you before the session end.
State government is slowly shrinking.
"Over the recent five year period, government shrank by 4.2 per cent."
Wyoming state government has conducted itself responsibly and has not recklessly added positions and programs.
"Good government, however, continues to evaluate itself."
The goal for state employees is to provide effective government services and to do it efficiently.
"This means long-range planning, goal-setting, working hard and working smart to achieve the goals."
And then measuring performance.
"Performance Evaluation Today I ask you to join me in a partnership to outline a statewide vision, philosophy and mission for our state so that all of our citizens may have an understanding of and can participate in the future development of Wyoming."
Development of the agency plans is a start.
I plan to refine the goals in terms that can be measured and evaluated so that the Legislature and the general public knows what to expect for their tax dollars.
I have asked the State Auditor to develop a performance reporting system to convert goals and objectives to reportable form.
I am proposing a statewide teleconference early next summer so that legislators and the general public can participate in a general discussion of government programs just before the start of the next budget preparation cycle.
I will ask the Management Council of the legislature for a partnership from the Program Evaluation Division of LSO to help refine performance evaluation procedures.
"And finally, I will join the efforts of the Budget Division and the Economic Analysis division of the Department of A&I; to undertake long range planning to project budget needs into a five year forward look to begin the process of long term evaluation of new goals and programs.New partnerships."
"Together, we will bring respect back to government."
Performance-Based Programs The 1993 legislation requiring all state agencies to develop five-year strategic plans have yielded uneven results.
"The requirement was worthy, but parts of state government are unfamiliar with performance-based programming."
We will work hard and fast to bring all part of government in line with clearly defined performance goals.
"The cabinet and related units of state government will very shortly undergo extensive training in defining programs, establishing performance goals and measuring results."
"I will use up to $10,000 to implement this training."
"Clearly, the budget that will emerge from this process will be immediately tied to reinvigorated programs."
"Governor's Fellowship Opportunity In order to involve interested, alert young people in the newly defined state government, I am instituting a Governor's Fellowship Program."
"I have asked members of the Cabinet and the executives of the four other elected offices to initiate an intern or fellowship program for people from the community colleges, from the University, and from business to work in state government."
Education Governor's Conference on Education Much of the discussion about education funding and education restructuring has been on hold for over a year while the Wyoming Supreme Court considers the degree to which our present funding structure provides every school child in Wyoming with equal access to education opportunities.
"It is appropriate that our funding formula be reviewed, and all of us concerned about education welcome the Court's comment on the Constitutionality of the present system."
"Decisions from the Court, however, do not diminish the responsibility of the Legislature nor of the Executive to determine education policy and the best means of delivering education services."
"To that end, I will convene a Governor's Conference on Education shortly after the Wyoming Supreme Court hands down its decision."
Participation at this Conference will be broad.
"It will include knowledgeable people from the schools, from business and industry, from the colleges and University, and from government."
"It will include parents, retired citizens--the many people who are concerned about quality and cost effectiveness of our education system."
The focus of the Governor's Conference will be to clarify a vision of excellence for Wyoming education.
It will bring attention to the models that are working well in Wyoming and to broaden the implementation of successful programs.
This conference will be concerned foremost with quality of Wyoming education.
"Parents, teachers, administrators and students agree that educational excellence includes basic academics, clear, high standards for achievement, discipline in the schools, the opportunity for choice, parents who care, knowledgeable teachers, more local control, and far less government intrusion."
Our vision of excellence must begin with an insistence on the division of educational responsibility.
Development of the intellect is the responsibility of the school.
"Development of the social, emotional, and personal skills rests with the family and the community."
Teachers should not have to serve as surrogate parents.
"Parents, in turn, should instill respect for education in their children and take responsibility for their well being ."
Schools should be accountable for teaching.
Students should be accountable for learning.
Parents and community should be accountable for nurturing.
Let us not forget that there is much good news about education in Wyoming.
Some high schools have directly addressed the needs of those students who intend to go on for technical or service training in addition to preparing all students in substantive academic subjects.
"Some schools are well along in incorporating technology in classrooms, and their high school graduates are thoroughly comfortable with computers as well as comfortable with challenging books, issues, and figures."
"In most Wyoming towns, the school's activities are the focus of community interest."
Schools enjoy wide support from parents and working people.
"Our school facilities, by and large, are envied by surrounding states."
"Yes, we in Wyoming have a solid basis from which to clarify a vision for excellence."
But education costs are spiraling.
"We must undertake the hard work of financial modeling, of understanding what drives costs and what creates efficiencies."
"The Governor's Conference on Education will not deliberate how to spend more or less money, but how to spend money differently."
"One-time Funding Increase The challenge is ours--you as legislators, we as members of the executive--to assure a more stable source of education funding."
"By funding the foundation program for a biennium and by incorporating the education budget into the state budget, we have made progress toward accountable budgeting."
"Yet, planned expenses continue to inflate."
"The continuation of the sales tax will alleviate dire crisis for the 1996-1997 biennium, but needs are pressing now."
"Because there was no increase in education funding from the 1994 budget session and no additional funds forthcoming until next year's session, many programs cannot keep pace."
To that end I urge the legislature to authorize approximately $4.7 million to the foundation fund as a one-time increase.
This increase is not to be interpreted as raising of the classroom unit funding (CRU).
"It is, rather, a necessary augmentation that is to be used to cover escalating costs."
In no way is this one-time funding increase intended to create an expectation that we will be unable to meet in the future.
"Community Colleges Wyoming's education system is, or should be, seamless from kindergarten to graduate school."
Integral in that seamless system are the community colleges.
"Regarded not only for their small classes and highly trained instructors, community colleges are close to mainstreet merchants, industry, and local public policy interests."
"From Rock Springs to Gillette, from Torrington to Powell, Wyoming's seven community colleges are partners in community and state- wide economic development planning."
They are the site and focus of deliberations as well as the incubator for ideas.
"Moreover, Wyoming's community colleges are critical for providing opportunity for non-traditional students as well as providing rigorous educational challenges convenient to home."
The Wyoming public television station housed at Central Wyoming College is the promise of future cohesiveness in the state--a way for Wyoming to work together.
"Casper College, now with its UW/CC Center, is garnering a national reputation for quality and flexibility of its programs."
"But here again, present budget constraints have resulted in a situation that is out-of-step with normal expectations."
"Specifically, community college faculty salaries are low."
I remain committed to the 1994 legislative goal that community college salaries be brought to within 90 per cent of market by the year 1998.
University of Wyoming In Wyoming's seamless education system the University stands paramount.
Much of what goes on in education is driven from the top down.
This has the effect of placing high responsibility on the University for leadership and modeling.
I applaud the institution of high admission standards that will go into effect in the fall.
"I commend the University of Wyoming for convening the Institute for Environment and Natural Resource Research and Policy, and extend my full support to its Chairman, William Ruckelshaus, former director of the Environmental Protection Agency."
Land and Water Let me turn next to land and water.
I support the continuation of the temporary moratorium on the sale of state lands.
The Board of Land Commissioners must have a general policy on the sale and use of state lands.
I support a general inventory of the lands to determine the current land use and conditions and to render a recommendation on the best ultimate use.
"I recommend that the inventory be done by using existing state, federal and local agencies including resource and conservation districts."
"The inventory should develop an assessment of potential uses, including public access and recreation, surface leasing for activities such as timbering or grazing, and potential for mineral leasing and development."
"The inventory should be definitive in analyzing the feasibility of the sale of lands, either near term or as a future activity."
I am taking a strong approach on two fronts to resolve the controversial water issues in the North Platte River Basin - negotiation and litigation.
I have instructed the Attorney General and the State Engineer to aggressively defend and protect Wyoming's allocation of North Platte River water provided under court decrees.
"Concurrently, I will pursue direct discussions with Governor Nelson of Nebraska for a more comprehensive settlement of all water and environmental issues within the Platte River drainage."
Governor Nelson and I have already discussed options for pursuing settlement.
I am hopeful the negotiations will result in the satisfactory resolution of the differences between our states.
Drought - Can the Governor make it rain?
"For seven of the past eight years, Wyoming has suffered from moderate to severe drought."
"This year's early snowpack readings indicate that there is near to above normal accumulations in some areas, particularly in the northwest."
Other basins are well below average for this time of the season.
The best prospect for rain and snow accumulations is typically in March through May.
"However, the present snowpack coupled with low carryover storage in nearly all reservoirs points to the prospect of another water short year for irrigation, municipal and stock water in 1995."
I intend to watch the water possibilities closely and will not hesitate to pull together federal and state groups to ease the impact of extended drought.
I've told Governor Pete Wilson of California to send some of his surplus rain on east to Wyoming!
Specific Legislation and Committee Assignments The remainder of my recommendations will deal with topics associated with the committee structure of the Legislature.
Judiciary Governmental accountability - I support the general concept of the bills considered by the Joint Judiciary interim committee.
Juvenile Justice - I support the bills that allow limited access to juvenile court records.
"Teachers, law enforcement, counsellors, and victims are entitled to information that could enhance the administration of juvenile justice."
Parental and individual responsibility are significant in bills that assign parental liability for actions of their children.
I support those bills that would require parental support for court placements as well as responsibility for their children's actions.
"In the general administration of justice, I am pleased that Chief Justice Golden and the associate justices of the Supreme Court have agreed to meet with me on a regular and informal basis to discuss matters of the judiciary and the executive branch."
"To my knowledge, informal discussions of this nature have never occurred between the Governor and the Supreme Court."
I commend the justices for their genuine concern for the state and their willingness to participate.
"To date, we have discussed the public defender's office, court ordered placement of juveniles, alternative dispute resolution, the judicial Supervisory Commission, structure of the county courts, and the timeliness of court decisions after presentation."
I am prepared to support Justice Golden in his recommendations that follow in his remarks to you on the state of the Judiciary in Wyoming.
They are thoughtful and timely.
"In addition, I am requesting informal exchanges with the other officers of the Judiciary including the district court judges through the Judicial Conference."
Appropriations I will ask the appropriations committee to support my initiative to present the next biennial budget in a format that supports funding by programs rather than by individual line item spending as has been the case in the past.
"With regard to the supplemental budget request, my general approach will be to support very little new funding this year."
I approve of the idea of a two year budget as adopted last session.
"I will request second year funding for specific programs including: court ordered placements; the Water Resources Center at the University of Wyoming; and, the adult developmental disabilities program."
Each of these was only partially funded in the past budget session.
"In addition, I will request supplemental funding for adult male correctional facilities and will request funds to determine the best and most efficient use of the male corrections system."
"Overcrowding and general deterioration of the current facilities forces a look at a better way to deal with adult male offenders, including new facilities and better risk assessment and placement programs."
I envision a new and enhanced role for the existing prison in Rawlins and a start toward building a new facility in Lovell as currently directed by statute.
Employee compensation remains a top priority along with job training and professional development.
I will continue to work with the directive established in the budget bill to fund the next round of pay increases from increased efficiencies and program reallocations.Revenue.
I have asked the Budget Office and the co-chair of the revenue estimating group to project income and expenditures for the next four years beyond the present budget cycle.
The results are not encouraging.
"In order to cover the shortfall in school funding a year from now, I will request an extension of the budget reserve account diversion from the permanent mineral trust fund and a continuation of the fourth cent sales tax."
I will not support any new taxes.
I further recommend that the extension of the sales tax be limited in time and in quantity.
I ask that you index the sales tax extension so that it will decline if the revenue to the state increases.
"For example, if the revenue grows by $35 Million, the sales and use tax would be reduced by half."
"With both these measures for the current year we will just break even, and with no new programs we will face a projected $127 million shortfall when we convene in 1996."
"Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources."
"In addition to the initiatives on tourism, recreation and the arts, I will support a revision of the tax classification of Game and Fish property."
The recent ruling by the Board of Equalization to reclassify the land as other that agriculture presents a precedent that could threaten any other ag land classification where the owner is engaged in secondary businesses.State Park Fees.
I do not favor expanding state fees for any parks this year.
"Mines, Minerals and Economic Development."
"In addition to the items I mentioned earlier, I commend the work of the interim committee on the limited expansion of branch banking and support limiting it to intra-county."
"Labor, Health and Social Services."
I intend to pursue the expansion of welfare reform to include the rest of the state not covered in the pilot program.
"Conclusion Wyoming is a state rich in resources -- Minerals, timber, water, scenery, wildlife and people."
Your work this session -- as in all sessions of the legislatures -- focuses on what will happen to those resources.
What do we want to protect and perpetuate?
We have a legacy in our resources and a legacy in our values and heritage.
"We all can share a vision of a place in the country, undisturbed by pollution and urban sprawl.Serenity.Secure friendships."
A good place to raise a family.
Our challenge is to maintain the vision as Wyoming's reality.
"In this great State we are willing to first govern self -- to take personal responsibility for ourselves, our families and our communities."
"When those personal responsibilities are honored, then our institutional government can be properly defined and effectively applied."
I am encouraged by the warm words of encouragement and cooperation expressed by so many members of this body.
I recall the day -- last March -- when I removed my name plate from the desk I occupied across the hall in the Senate.
Those of us who have been part of the group take that as an indication a member will not return.
There was a closure to my days as a legislature in that action.
"My office is now downstairs, and I am ever mindful of the proper role we each play."
I honor and respect the role of the legislature in shaping Wyoming.
We will work together this session.
I have presented my priorities.
I trust you will have many of your own.
We will next meet as a group when you have completed your work.
"I know that at that time we will have worked together, to bring competing interests together, to benefit Wyoming."
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.
I look forward to the work we will do together over the next weeks.
