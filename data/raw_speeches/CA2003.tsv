Let me tell you a story about a 10-year-old girl from Whittier named Anies Garcia.
Anies was born with non-functioning kidneys.
In 1997, she had a kidney transplant.
Unfortunately, her body rejected it and she developed heart failure.
Her only hope was a combined kidney/heart transplant.
But, at the time, the risk of rejection was simply too high.
So her doctor, Bob Ettenger, worked round-the-clock with a team of bio-scientists and specialists at UCLA and Mattel Children's Hospital.
Together, they developed breakthrough medicine - specifically for children, specifically for double transplants - that would stop her body from rejecting the new organs.
Because of these revolutionary drugs, Anies was able to become only the second child in America under the age of 10 to successfully receive a combined heart and kidney transplant.
Today, she's doing great.
In fact, she's with us tonight.
And she's here with the doctor who dedicated his life to saving hers - Dr. Bob Ettenger.
Please give these heroic Californians a spirited welcome.
Theirs is a story of great inspiration.
It reminds us once again how Californians have always defied the odds to triumph over adversity.
Our parents and grandparents sacrificed for us, fought and died for us, endured the Depression, and perished in the Holocaust.
Despite all of this, their generation invested in our future.
They built our schools, our roads, our farms and our businesses.
They didn't fear their destiny.
They seized it.
They showed us how the worst of times can bring out the best in each other.
And they left behind a far greater California for the generations that succeeded them.
So shall we.
My friends, the state of our state has always been strong - not because of the size of our treasury, but because of the soul of our people.
Let us prove worthy of our rich legacy.
Let us rise to the challenge of our time.
Let us summon the courage to do what is right and the will to do it together.
