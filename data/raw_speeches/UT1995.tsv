President Beattie, Speaker Brown, Senator Howell, Representative Pignanelli, Chief Justice Zimmerman --- Fellow Utahns.
It is a pleasure to greet you.
Today, we celebrate Human Rights Day, a tribute to Martin Luther King, and we also embark on the 51st session of the Utah State Legislature.
A few weeks ago, like thousands of you, I wrote a Centennial Essay titled, What living in Utah Means to Me.
I wrote of boyhood experiences; fishing, learning to work, and Little League baseball.
A little league hat is something a guy likes to keep.
This is NOT my little league hat.
My mother got rid of it, probably at the same time she threw my baseball cards out, which would incidentally be worth thousands of dollars by now if she hadn't thrown them away.
Anyway, Little League was a big deal in Cedar City.
They printed the box scores in the Iron County Record, the radio station broadcast games, and people talked about it at the barber shop.
There were people like Tom Cardon and Blaine Betensen, who for years at 6 o'clock in the morning, picked up sleepy eyed boys in the back of an old Dodge pickup and hauled them off to practice.
When I was nine years old, our first game was against Safeway.
Robert Garrick was their star pitcher; a 12-year old who rumor had it, was six feet tall.
The very mention of his name struck fear into the heart of a nine-year old rookie.
I silently hoped I wouldn't play.
In the last inning however, the coach put me into the right field.
Then I started hoping I wouldn't have to bat.
I stood in the on deck circle with two out.
To my disappointment the batter in front of me walked and Tom Cardon called time out.
The conversation went something like this.
"""Are you scared?"""
"""Yep. """
Listen, you can do this.
Just stand in there, most things aren't as bad as you think they're going to be.
It's been 34 years since that conversation and while I have no memory of the outcome of that at bat, (although I have my suspicions) I have a clear memory of the conversation with my coach, the confidence he gave me.
I have since learned to appreciate the goodness of his commitment to a bunch of boys.
All of us have had experiences that shaped our lives.
Tonight I would like to talk about the forces that will shape our future as a state, and about a conviction I have that the foundation of prosperity is goodness, not government.
First, let me speak of our successes: Our economy is solid and diverse.
Every indicator shows we are a top five state in economic activity.
Nearly every county in the state has experienced growth, with 55% of the state's in-migration occurring off the Wasatch Front.
This is both promising and historic.
But our excellent business climate and the jobs with our major employers must be constantly guarded.
Our biggest employer, Hill Air Force Base, continues to be threatened and we must be vigilant, doing all within our power, to protect those jobs.
Economic prosperity is a time when taxpayers should enjoy some tax relief.
I propose to work with our legislature for a tax cut this year for the second year in a row.
I have listed nine ways to do it and there are probably nine other suitable ways it can be accomplished.
The important thing is that we get it done.
Both our public education and higher education systems are generating top 10 results--whether it be test scores, graduation rates, college enrollment, technology use or research.
By this June we will have 300 Centennial Schools, all involving parents and innovating to improve the way children learn.
Tonight I express gratitude to our educators who do so much to lead us in a quality way to the next century.
Utah's prospects to host the 2002 Olympics are promising.
This would be an unparalleled opportunity to showcase our state, to establish forever a worldwide reputation for quality.
Our state is becoming a model in health care.
Healthprint, which was adopted by the Legislature last year, rejects government run health care and improves our private health care system with insurance reforms--and quality accountability.
Tens of thousands of Utahns have health care now as a result of Healthprint.
With Healthprint, our world class medical care, and health-conscious people.
Utah has lower health care costs than 49 of the 50 states.
This year we must take the next step.
We cannot lose our resolve.
This truly is a golden era in our state's history, but it is also a period of unparalleled change, full of opportunity and peril.
I believe there are four major forces of change that will shape this state.
They are: dramatic population growth, a rapid transition into the information age, the general crumbling of the concept of family, and an impending collision between financial reality and our national government.
GROWTH Growth will be the dominant issue in our state over the next decade and beyond.
Zero growth is neither desirable nor optional.
Most of our population increase will be our own children and grandchildren.
Just to employ them, we must create nearly 30,000 new jobs each year.
We have come to expect basic conveniences, such as limited traffic congestion, an abundance of inexpensive clean water, and clean air.
All of those expectations are challenged by growth.
Planners estimate that in the next 10 to 12 years the state has more than six billion dollars in roads, water and building project needs to keep pace with growth.
Even if we bonded at the high end of our tolerance for debt, $100 million a year, our total investment in 10 years would be one billion, only one-sixth of the projected demand.
Beginning an aggressive investment program this year is vital.
I have proposed a record amount, $81 million in new funding, as the first installment in a long-term commitment to meet our highway needs.
We must avoid gridlock on our freeways, and I call on you to make this investment.
We cannot wait; this is the year.
Even with record funding, there is a reality we must face here.
Government will not have enough money to build everything desired.
We must be willing to voluntarily car pool, use public transportation, stagger our work schedule to off-peak hours, conserve water, keep our cars tuned.
TECHNOLOGY While the challenges of growth are daunting, the second major force of change can help us.
We are entering the information age, a new era.
We will soon live in a networked society of electronic commerce, distance learning, telecommuting and automation of many daily tasks.
This can mean less freeway congestion, less pollution, and a slowing of our building needs.
I have recommended $37 million in this year's budget, part of our seven-year $120 million Technology 2000 initiative, to help prepare our students and our workers for this future.
This money will significantly expand distance learning, develop courses to be delivered electronically, connect schools and libraries to the electronic highway.
But the real promise of technology will not be realized in bandwidth and bytes, or fiber with five hundred channels.
Instead, it will be realized in freeing people to do what people do best, and what only people can do -- to act in ways that create goodness and do something desperately needed, strengthen our families.
PROVIDING A SAFETY NET FOR OUR CHILDREN Our third major focus of change involves the change in society's families.
One of the tough jobs in this world is being a case worker at the state Division of Family Services.
These are the people who every day pick up the pieces of lives laced with tragedy and pain.
They deal with parents who are neglecting and abusing their own children.
Every day these caseworkers are called upon to walk into horrifying situations and make judgements about whether children are safe with their own parents.
Tonight, we have 75 children who are temporarily in state shelters.
For these 75 children something so traumatic has happened in their lives that it was unsafe for them to be with their parents.
Babies born with cocaine running through their veins and abused in their first days of life, kids who didn't know where they would sleep from one night to the next as their parents dragged them from dirty motels to the apartments of friends or strangers, kids with broken arms and broken hearts.
I have spoken tonight of goodness, but nowhere is there a better example than the foster families who provide shelter and a safe harbor while the crisis passes.
We have 1,800 children with foster care families, families who talk to these children, help them with their school work, cheer for them; they do their best to parent them.
It is hard work.
These are children who have been hurt, confused or robbed of their dignity and self esteem.
Societies prosper not by the grace of governments, but by continuing cycles of goodness, generated by the people themselves.
When my great-great-grandfather, Jeremiah Leavitt, died while crossing the plains to Utah, Sarah, his wife was able to continue west with their children, largely because others, with intuitive goodness, hoisted her children onto their shoulders to help her along the way.
Today, there is a constant need for that kind of goodness to manifest itself in the lives of people.
The state has done what it can for 75 children in shelter tonight by removing them from crisis situations.
Tomorrow there could be 80 or 85 or 90.
Now, there is a need for good people to do what government can't do and that's be a family to a child who isn't safe going home.
Tonight, I implore families in this state to consider whether you might be able to hoist a child on your shoulders, to help others along the way.
If you can help, pick up the phone and call 538-HOME.
A society will ultimately be judged by how it treats its children.
EDUCATION Manifestations of disintegrating families can be seen in our schools.
As I visit schools almost every week, I see the challenges and successes first hand.
The children ask questions.
First and second graders always ask what's it like to be governor.
The fourth graders inquire about my favorite sports team.
"The sixth graders' favorite question seems to be ""how much money do you make?"""
I see many wonderful schools, devoted teachers and parents who are involved in the education and lives of their children.
Let me tell you about a remarkable school that is changing lives of children, many of whom aren't getting support at home.
There are 359 students in this school.
One hundred ten of them spoke one of seventeen languages better than English.
Over twenty of the students have fathers in prison, at least eight have mothers in prison.
Nearly 75 percent of the children came from families with only one parent.
During my visit the principal took from the closet a bag of guns, knives, pornography, condoms and other items he confiscated from the children during his first year there.
He told stories of abuse that were heart breaking.
I listened to a sixth grader haltingly read.
Neither of his parents read or speak English.
Next year he goes to junior high.
I thought of my own children and their transition to junior high school.
You know what happens, the world blows up on them.
Instead of one teacher it's seven.
What if you didn't speak English and couldn't read.
"""Without individualized help,"" the principal said, ""when that boy goes to junior high, he'll be in a gang by the end of the first quarter."
"""With 36 children in a class, like this, it's tough."
The principal is doing everything he can for these children.
He has rallied support from parents and community groups.
But he needs more help.
All of our schools need smaller classes.
I am recommending a 40 percent increase this year in class size reduction funds.
But this year I am recommending that we target some of the money specifically at those Highly Impacted Schools.
It will pay big dividends.
There's an important side bar to this story.
I was surprised to see a respected community leader named Jay walk into the principal's office.
The principal told me that Jay spends two hours, twice a week, helping those sixth graders learn to read.
If you're worried about troubled young people; if you really want to do something to help, do what Jay's doing -- volunteer at a school and teach a child to read.
Do it individually, or get your business to enter into a school partnership, as hundreds of businesses and government agencies have done.
Thousands of Utah children are now being tutored and assisted by volunteers from the community.
By volunteering this way, you will do more to keep a child out of gangs than an army of police officers or a corps of social workers can do later.
Because the foundation of prosperity is goodness, not government.
JUVENILE CRIME Sometimes goodness fails.
In the fall of 1993, a series of tragic and senseless shootings awoke our community to the reality that the security of our neighborhoods could be threatened.
In a special session of the legislature we launched a generation long, community wide response.
Including my proposal this year, we have nearly tripled the amount of space in our prisons and incarceration programs, added judges and probation officers and limited the possession and use of guns by young people under 18.
Now it's time for another important step.
In our current system if a 16 or 17 year old commits a violent crime, unless they are certified as an adult, their crime isn't even called a crime, it's a civil offense That's got to change.
Tonight, I formally request the creation of a new category of criminal in our system of justice called Serious Youth Offender.
This law will carry with it average sentences that are twelve times more severe than our juvenile system.
To juveniles who rape, rob or kill, this law has a simple but straight forward message.
Commit an adult crime.
serve adult time.
BALANCING THE FEDERAL BUDGET Now I would like to turn your attention to the fourth major force of change, the impending collision between financial reality and our national government.
In coming weeks commentators will rhetorically test our nation's will to balance the federal budget.
The question is: can we accept pain today to avert a crisis later?
Let me illustrate this point.
Brian's a school teacher who has a special talent for getting kids hooked on books.
Years ago, he started having chronic back pain.
His doctor prescribed codeine.
It made him feel better all the way around.
Brian's doctor was compassionate, so he increased the doses.
Eventually, Brian realized that the back pain was as bad as it had ever been, but he now needed the codeine just to get by.
Finally, Brian realized he was addicted to a drug that didn't even solve the problem for which it was prescribed.
His addiction created a whole new sickness.
Brian finally got help, not from a compassionate but misguided doctor, but from a drug withdrawal clinic.
The withdrawal was painful and prolonged.
At times, it seemed like it would be easier to just keep popping codeine, but the codeine would have destroyed him.
With help Brian learned to deal with his back pain a different way; constant exercise, a strict diet and stretching exercises.
The federal government and perhaps we should say, the American people, have an addiction of sorts.
We are addicted to deficit spending.
Years ago, the federal government started deficit spending like Brian took codeine, a little bit at first, because of an emergency.
As time went on, a little bit more.
Soon we lost our self restraint.
The problems got worse, and we needed to spend more just to see an impact.
Now we're hooked and the prescription isn't working.
Unless our financial trend is reversed, our nation is headed for financial disaster.
Last month, the Bi-Partisan Entitlements Commission issued a report stating that twelve years ago, 56 percent of the federal budget was used for welfare, other entitlements and interest on the national debt.
Today it's more than 60 percent, and it's growing so fast that by 2012, 100 percent of the entire national budget will be committed in that way.
When my 5-year-old son enters the work force, the entire federal budget will be obligated to entitlements and interest.
No money will be left for national defense, for building highways, or for natural disasters.
I didn't say LESS money.
I said NO money.
If we don't begin a disciplined withdrawal of our deficit spending addiction, this country will be brought to its knees.
It is time to exercise restraint.
Right now in Washington, we are experiencing a historic moment.
Very soon, the Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment proposed by our own senior senator, Orrin Hatch.
It is possible that during our Centennial year this Legislature will have the opportunity to ratify the amendment.
Ratification is important, but that's the easy part.
The withdrawal will be painful.
State governments, including our own state, will have to get by with fewer federal dollars.
REBALANCING POWER IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM There is another important part of the political change that is occurring in our nation.
We must go beyond balancing budgets to balancing power in the federal system.
Otherwise, states will be entirely at the mercy of the federal government and may be left with even more mandates as money becomes scarce.
More than 200 years ago our Founding Fathers, men like James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, participated in arguably the most important debate in the history of western civilization, the Constitutional Convention of 1787.
Those meetings produced what many maintained was a miracle -- a new country that balanced the need for a strong national government with the wisdom of keeping most everyday governmental functions local.
They created a strong national government with limited and enumerated -- but supreme -- powers, such as national defense and interstate commerce.
The founders gave the states all other powers not delegated to the national government.
The founders expected the states and the national government to jealously guard their respective roles.
The natural tension between them would protect the rights of the people and prevent any sector of government from becoming too powerful.
We know today that the intent of the founders has been badly eroded.
The national government has centralized authority, and is over-mandating, over-spending, and over-reaching.
The people of this country want it fixed.
Earlier today you, the Legislature, passed a resolution proposing that Utah send a delegation to join with other states in an historic convocation, a Conference of the States, to consider ways to fundamentally and permanently restore balance in the American system of government.
I will join legislators at the conclusion of my remarks to sign this important resolution.
The Conference of the States will be the first time in our history since that celebrated convention in 1787 that the states of this nation have come together to address this issue of balance in our governance.
This is our stewardship in protecting the vitality and integrity of American democracy.
It is our responsibility, our role .
. . and it must be done.
I have talked tonight about a number of critical government priorities; the need to rebalance the state's relationship with the federal government, to provide a safety net for our children, to build infrastructure that will accommodate growth, and lead the way into the information age.
These government initiatives are all deeply important.
I have also talked to you about people; people who are doing good things for other people.
Jay, who takes four hours out of his busy week to teach children to read.
Foster families, 1,800 of them, who have made room in their lives for children who need nurturing, Tom Cardon, who taught me a little bit about baseball but a whole lot more about self- confidence, people in all parts of the state who will hoist the children of others on their shoulders.
These are the people who are creating true prosperity for Utah.
As we prepare for our Centennial celebration next year, it is this basic goodness that is the hallmark of our first 100 years, and which will be the key to our future prosperity.
It is with this recognition that I am partnering with the Legislature to form a Centennial Values Initiative.
Through this initiative, a broad cross section of community leaders will come together to identify, enhance and perpetuate the goodness in our people.
It is this goodness that enables our society to prosper, not just financially, but with a far deeper, richer and more lasting sense of security, caring and well being.
During the next 44 days, you will consider more than 1,000 pieces of legislation.
Money will be appropriated for roads, prisons, and schools.
We will review rules of criminal behavior and penalties for those who break them.
We will debate our obligations and make adjustments to our social safety net.
All of those things are what government does, and in this state we do it well.
But tonight, one final time, I would like to restate my belief that the foundation of prosperity is goodness, not government.
Government cannot legislate goodness but we can nurture it.
Government cannot appropriate goodness, but we can teach it.
We cannot compel it, but we can practice it, exemplify it and we must stand for it.
