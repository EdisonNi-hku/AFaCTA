Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Speaker Murphy, members of the General Assembly, members of the Judiciary, members of the Consular Corps, my fellow Georgians: Last year when I came before you, I said that there were things we had to change if we wanted Georgia to continue to prosper and grow.
Today, Georgia is stronger because of the courage you showed in confronting those challenges.
We took an important first step toward dealing with Georgia's transportation, pollution, and land use problems by establishing the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority.
This year I hope we will build on that beginning by preserving greenspace in our fastest growing counties.
We enacted a comprehensive patient's bill of rights to reign in the worst excesses of HMOs and managed care and gave Georgians an insurance advocate to keep rate increases from being approved unchallenged.
We passed an $83 million property tax cut to help every Georgia homeowner - a tax break I hope you'll agree to double this year.
Because of your actions, Georgia's economy continues to grow.
We now have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded - just 3.2 percent -- and last year Georgia businesses created 155,000 new jobs.
This year I'm asking you for the same kind of effort and the same level of courage as we face an even greater problem.
Six years ago, Georgia ranked 49th in educating our children.
Today, we rank 50th.
The District of Columbia passed us last year.
According to last week's report from the Council for School Performance, an independent body created by the Georgia General Assembly in 1993, 70,000 Georgia children are stuck in failing schools.
No matter how you look at it - SAT scores, high school completion rates, 8th grade math proficiency, even the Armed Forces Qualification Test - one message is clear: We must improve education now.
It's time we put some facts on the table about education reform, because the special interests are spreading fictions.
You have heard from some school superintendents concerned about funding even though there is a $133 million enhancement in the budget.
For years, the General Assembly has sent superintendents and school boards millions of dollars to lower class size.
Instead of keeping classes in the early grades at 17 students per teacher where the General Assembly funded it, some of them have used the money to add to administration while class sizes have ballooned to 33 per class.
The education bill I have sent to you requires them to use that money to lower class sizes.
And they don't like it.
Some school boards are grumbling, too.
You know why?
Because school councils will give parents, principals, and teachers more control over their schools.
Some school boards don't like the threat of real local control.
The Department of Education complains about accountability and says that Georgia schools are on the right track.
The education bureaucrats and special interests are never going to be happy with reform.
So if I have this many special interests upset, I must be doing something right.
Maybe that's why the public dialogue on education has produced such a broad consensus about the kind of reform Georgia schools need.
We agree that Georgia should set high standards for its schools and then measure their progress toward these standards.
We agree that our best and brightest teachers should be rewarded and that teachers who do the best job educating our children should be paid for their excellence.
We agree that every teacher should have a basic competency in technology.
We agree that parents and teachers should have more control over their neighborhood schools.
And we agree that students should not be forced to attend a school that's failing them.
But there is one thing we don't yet agree on, and that's what I'm here to talk to you about today.
Ending teacher tenure.
Georgia has many great teachers and even more good ones.
They are the vast majority of the teachers in our classrooms, and tenure doesn't affect them because they not only do their jobs -- they do them well.
But - as with doctors, or lawyers, or any other profession -- there are a very few bad apples in the barrel.
And, as in every other profession, those few bad teachers sully the name and tarnish the reputation of every good, hardworking teacher we have who works long hours and cares deeply about the students under their care.
Those few bad teachers don't deserve the right to stain the honor of good teachers everywhere.
They don't deserve the chance to keep our children from receiving a good education.
They don't deserve unconditional job protection.
In these cases, teacher tenure puts the legislative seal of approval - your seal of approval - on failure.
And every day we don't do something about it - every day we keep these few failing teachers in our schools -- we insult the thousands of good and great teachers working to bring out the best in our children.
Good teachers don't need tenure, and bad teachers don't deserve it.
One of Georgia's greatest teachers is with us today.
Ken Almon teaches 5th grade at Norcross Elementary School.
Ken is a winner of the Milken Award for excellence in education.
The Milken Award is the Nobel Prize for educators.
We are also honored that Mr. Almon's 5th grade class was able to join us today.
Look in on their classroom and you might find his students singing musical presentations of grammar and math facts, making imaginary journeys into space, studying bean plants through journal records, or harvesting a fall garden.
Ken often hosts afternoon read-ins, all-day math and science sessions for students, and classes for parents to help them understand the concepts their children are learning.
Ken, would you and your class please stand as we thank their teacher for giving his talents, energy, and love to the children of Georgia.
Thank you.
Not all of Georgia's best educators are teachers.
Some are also principals.
And one of them is Joan Akin.
Joan runs the largest middle school in this country - and one of the best - Creekland Middle School in Lawrenceville.
In 1993, it was named a Georgia School of Excellence, and Joan became a Milken Award winner.
Recognizing the special needs of adolescents, Joan works hard to make her school warm, welcoming, and secure for her students.
These efforts have won her school an International Inviting School Award.
Joan, stand up.
Thank you for being here today.
And thank you for working so hard for Georgia children.
Ken and Joan have a number of things in common.
They are two of Georgia's greatest educators.
They are devoted to our children.
They are Milken Award winners.
And they both agree that ending tenure is good for Georgia students.
Why do we need to end teacher tenure?
Because it keeps those few bad teachers in the classroom - and the children in those classrooms are being denied the opportunity to learn.
Listen to this story a parent told me.
His third-grade son came home one day with a 60 on a geography quiz.
Concerned about the grade, the parents set up a teacher conference.
On the test, students had to identify several features on a world map.
"One question asked students to label the equator, and the boy had written ""equator"" just above the line that ran from left to right across the center of the map."
Although they knew that some things had changed since they were in school, the parents felt pretty sure that their son was right.
"When they asked the teacher about it, he pulled out the textbook and said, ""You see, here the word 'equator' is written just below that line, so your son is wrong."
"The student had also written the words ""Pacific Ocean"" on the big blue stretch between Asia and South America."
"But he had written it below the equator, and in the book the words ""Pacific Ocean"" appeared above the equator."
The teacher showed this to the parents and again said their son was wrong.
It took a visit to the principal to change the student's grade.
But because of tenure that teacher still works in Georgia schools today.
Most of the time, tenure means that a principal doesn't even try to dismiss a bad teacher - because, even if the principal bucks the odds and succeeds, the cost in time and money is staggering.
A national study a few years ago found that, on average, it takes two to three years to dismiss a tenured teacher, and each case costs taxpayers about $60,000.
Heaven knows, I have no problem with lawyers making a living.
But not at the cost of our children's future.
A county school administrator recently told me a story about how much tenure costs taxpayers.
One day a teacher, upset about a new school policy, barged into his principal's office in protest.
Still unhappy, the teacher stormed away from school, leaving his class unattended and no lesson plans for someone to take his place.
Now this is clearly a teacher who is not stable enough to have responsibility for 30 children.
The superintendent scheduled a hearing with the county school board to dismiss the teacher.
After a three-day hearing - and that alone cost thousands of dollars - the board fired the teacher.
But that's not the end of the story.
The teacher appealed the school board's decision to the State Board of Education.
Then he appealed the State Board's ruling to the Superior Court.
And he appealed that ruling to the United States District Court.
All of them agreed: This teacher should not be in the classroom.
But - because of tenure - it took four years and cost taxpayers $57,000 to get him out of the classroom.
Let me give you one more reason to bring an end to tenure - and this one is the most important of all.
Study after study has found that teacher quality is the single most important factor in determining how well a child learns -- more important than student background, more important than class size, more important than spending per student.
Just one bad teacher can do irreparable damage to a child's education.
Researchers at the University of Tennessee found that two similar students - one with a three-year string of good teachers and the other with a three-year string of bad teachers - will be 50 to 60 percentile points apart on standardized tests at the end of those three years.
Tennessee researchers also found that if a poor-performing student in fourth grade has bad teachers for the next three years, he has only a 15 percent chance of passing the state's comprehensive 8th grade exam.
But if that same student has three good teachers, his chances of passing the exam skyrocket to 60 percent.
Unless we make sure that our children have consistently good teachers, we are holding them back.
And let me tell you another thing.
If Oregon is any guide, the number of bad apples we're talking about here is probably less than one per school.
When Oregon abolished tenure in its schools, in the first year the Portland School District brought about 90 educators - about one in 40 - up for special review and ultimately dismissed 30 teachers and four principals, less than one percent.
Ending tenure didn't wreak havoc on their schools - it improved them.
Most of the educators who came up for special review were - with the county's help through staff development and training - able to improve and keep their jobs.
And the very few who were dismissed?
They're the teachers who don't really teach.
The kind of people who should not be in our classrooms.
The kind of people tenure protects.
Does the fact that I want to remove from the classroom the very few teachers who are failing our children mean that I am demonizing and condemning all the great teachers of this state?
Of course not.
And the special interests who make that claim have one goal: divide us to protect the status quo rather than uniting us to improve education.
Those are the facts about tenure.
Now let me see if I can puncture some of the myths.
"I read a piece in the paper last week where the author wrote: ""Just as teachers do not simply abandon students who are not living up to their potential, the state should not abandon teachers who are not doing well."
That's an insult to every student, every parent, and every good and hardworking teacher in Georgia.
We have an obligation when our students aren't living up to their potential.
That's why we're here today.
Our obligation is to make their schools better.
And we also have a duty to the few teachers who can't or won't teach.
It's our duty to get them out of the classroom and get a teacher in there who can and will do the job.
Another myth is that ending tenure will let principals fire teachers for arbitrary or unjust reasons.
I don't apologize for trying to give principals - as well as parents and teachers - more local control over their schools.
One of the central ideas of my education reform plan is to give more power to parents, teachers, and principals at the expense of the education bureaucracy.
But this in no way means giving principals absolute power.
Like the rest of us, principals don't work in a vacuum.
Superintendents, school boards, and school councils will be looking over their shoulders - especially on hiring and firing decisions.
The idea isn't to arbitrarily fire teachers - it's to weed out the teachers who are failing our students.
Another myth making the rounds is if we don't offer teachers tenure, then we won't be able to attract good teachers.
That's not been the case where tenure has been abolished.
The two great educators we have here today will tell you that tenure is the last thing on their minds - teaching children is the first.
Finally, let me address one last myth: that elementary and high school teachers need job protections that no other profession gets in order to protect them from intellectual persecution.
Now, in universities, tenure may serve a noble purpose, protecting and encouraging the free exchange of ideas - even unpopular ones.
But spelling and geometry are not likely to provoke a raging controversy.
And grammar isn't unpopular unless it's time to do homework or right before a big test.
Georgia's great teachers know all this.
So do the good ones.
Our principals know it too.
And so do Georgia's parents.
You can stand with the bureaucrats who say our schools are good enough, or you can join us in making them better.
You can stand with the special interests that want to protect the worst teachers, or you can join us in lifting up our good teachers for praise and reward.
You can be flagbearers for failure, or crusaders for change.
Make the right choice.
Because the future of Georgia's children is in your hands.
Thank you, and God bless you.
