Good Evening.
Tonight I address you from Plymouth State University which serves as a positive model for others to follow in embracing the tides of change, its new name reflects those changes.
The State of the State Address has never been given north of Concord and tonight I am delighted to break tradition, and bring my message directly to the citizens of NH.
We are Unique Mr. President, Justices of the court, Executive Councilors, elected officials, taxpayers, Denise, citizens of the State of NH - I am honored to address you this evening, and report that the state of NH is unique.
We have the best economy in New England, one that grows faster in good times and slows more softly in bad times.
Our children continue to score at the top of all 50 states in their aptitude tests.
We are the healthiest state in the country, and we continue to have one of the lowest tax burdens of all 50 states.
Indeed, NH is unique!
Given these facts, it might seem that maintaining the status quo would be the wisest course, yet after a year in office I have assessed that New Hampshire's uniqueness is under attack.
At times, we seem to have forgotten what our forefathers fought so hard to protect: the notion that it's not government that makes a state great, but rather, it is its people.
And it is the people who, if given freedom, will continue to make NH great.
Not Living Within Our Means Our State government needs to accept the mantle of change.
We have not lived within our means despite the hardships of those who pay the bills.
In just the last 2 months, New Hampshire's credit rating has been downgraded, and it is not difficult to see why.
During the last 4 years prior to my taking office we spent all 200 million the State put aside in our savings account during one of the most prosperous times in state history.
If we couldn't live within our means during the good times it's no wonder we cannot do it now.
Taxpayer's Bill of Rights We cannot continue to spend our way to prosperity.
Other states have tried (pause) and have failed.
Those States now look to NH as a model for what government can be.
A big, inefficient government isn't the answer to our problem, it is the problem!
This is why I have proposed the Taxpayers Bill of Rights: a permanent solution to force elected leaders to make tough decisions about how they spend your money.
Last year in my inaugural address, I promised you no new taxes, no increased taxes, no way.
Your elected leaders delivered on that promise for the first time in decades and I congratulate them for it.
And now, pending passage of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights we will put a permanent stamp on that promise to you.
Education Education must change if we want our children to continue to dream.
We are fortunate to have such great parents and teachers in our state.
As long as I am Governor I will continue to fight for their right to have a say in the education of our children.
For far too long, we in Concord have messed with our education financing in hopes of improving our schools.
Though we have significantly increased our funding for education, our test scores have remained the same.
We have decreased our student-teacher ratio to 13-1, but still our test scores haven't improved.
"The current ""2 month"" education-funding plan is unacceptable."
We need a 5-year roadmap that eliminates the uncertainty plaguing our towns and cities.
Funding has continued to overshadow the quality of education.
We must find proactive and unique solutions to enhance educational quality in NH.
These include competition from Charter Schools and School Vouchers.
A couple of months ago the State Board of Education voted to remove all soda machines from all high schools.
This type of bureaucratic micromanagement is a dinosaur of the past.
Instead, I am excited to usher in a bold new paradigm and initiative in education which will allow students to use their Real World experience outside the 4 walls of their classroom, and have it count toward their educational requirements.
My daughter Lauren went to school with someone trying out for the Olympics, but still needed to take a gym class.
This makes no sense.
"Much as President Reagan extolled Mikhail Gorbachev "" to tear down this walls,"" we will ask every educator to tear down the walls of their classrooms and allow education to occur everywhere."
Earlier this month, thanks to the generosity of 26 NH businesses, I was able to hand out 700 laptops to 6 schools in NH.
The results are kids are eager to go to school and learn.

She has told me that her students won't leave the class when the bell rings, because they want to learn more.
Tina is here with us this evening.
Tina please stand up.
Nancy Ober, a teacher in the Winnisquam School in Tilton who touched my heart when she told me that after 34 years of teaching she thought there was no more chance to bring excitement into her classroom.
The laptop program has proved her wrong.
One of her students Ray told Nancy that he used to look forward to Fridays, but now looks forward to Mondays.
My goal is simple, to get kids to line-up before the bell rings in the morning and have those kids wanting to stay after the last bell rings at the end of the day.
We are reaching this goal.
We need to recognize that we have students who are in need of special help.
The strength of special education is the ability to work closely with a child who has real and insurmountable problems.
By properly identifying these children and getting them the help they need we are positioning them for success.
The tragedy, however, is when some students are mislabeled thus lowering their own expectations of academic achievement and diluting the resources of those who truly need them.
Together with our hard working special ed teachers, we must ensure that every child is properly evaluated and given every opportunity to excel and meet high expectations.
Therefore, tonight, I am pleased to announce the formation of my Limitless Learning task force to look at how we properly identify special needs students in the state.
Healthcare Healthcare is another area demanding change.
NH is currently one of the healthiest State in our Nation, however, much like the other issues we face, the status quo will not do given the current state of healthcare.
Costs are too high and there is a shortage of qualified personnel.
In response we made some legislative changes that have resulted in doubling the number of insurance providers offering insurance in this state.

In conjunction with Speare Memorial Hospital, we will now be graduating high school students not only with a high school degree but also an LPN degree.
This creative program needs to be made available throughout our state.
Tonight, we are pleased to have with us Kristina Stalnaker who will be one of the first graduates from this program in 2005.
We must remove the red tape of state government from the delivery of health care, and we must address the high cost of prescription drugs.
I am outraged that our own government would deny us a better quality of life by blocking the sale of prescription drugs from Canada.
We have struck the first blow of freedom in this fight, and we will continue to lead the way.
NH continues to suffer from an illicit drug problem among our youth.
We should not simply stand by and watch our children fall prey to addiction.
Soon, I will be appointing a trio of Drug Czars who will finally take charge and coordinate the State's efforts in combating the spread of illegal drug use.
Economy Our economy continues to provide opportunities for our citizens to thrive.
The NH economy is the envy of New England.
We have reached out to countless businesses that are looking for help or a new home here in the granite state.

Again, without any taxpayer dollars.
Thank you PSNH Next month, I will be launching my Ambassador Program, which will bring business leaders together from new and promising industries to work together to recruit new businesses in an effort to diversify our economy.
Remember those Serving Finally, we must remember America's fight for freedom never ends.
All of us here in tonight must remain more vigilant than ever, we couldn't be in better hands than in those of the great men and women who are serving in our military, police officers and firefighters.
We need to remember their efforts, pray for their safety and, most importantly, let us always remember to just say thank you.
Will all those here tonight we have served to protect us please stand up so we can say thank you.
One of my first duties as governor was to rectify a long time wrong occurring in our state.
I was shocked to learn that our own state employees called to duty did not have their pay protected.
How could this great state forget to take care of our own?
So I ordered that state employees called to active duty be given their full pay and benefits so they could fight for this country and not worry about their well being of their families.
I am pleased to recognize Mr. Bob Scott who has just returned form active duty.
Bob has been a dedicated state employee for many years.
I was delighted to be able to promote him to Director of Air Resources.
These actions are simply the right thing to do.
Conclusion By embracing change, NH will be in a position to retain its uniqueness.
I have tried to instill a new fiscally responsible, proactive attitude in state government and have asked our valuable state employees to help in decision making and risk taking, all in an effort to maximize scarce resources.
"Again, thinking back on President Reagan and his cry to ""tear down that wall""; the people of this great State need to demand the wall of the status quo be torn down."
For those who want to impede change we can no longer accept your excuses and countless criticisms.
Failure to preserve NH's uniqueness in the nation is a failure to us, and our children.
It is time to set the example in 2004 and give the citizens of this great State a government they can be proud of.
Tonight I commit to you that together we will learn from the lessons of our forefathers and pass on to our children the greatest place the world has ever seen, our Unique New Hampshire.
May God bless you and May God bless the state of New Hampshire.
