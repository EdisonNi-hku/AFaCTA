Speaker Madigan, President Philip, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Constitutional officers, members of the 90th General Assembly, and my fellow citizens of Illinois.
Seven years ago when I stood at this podium for the first time as Governor, the state of our great state was a major concern to me.
State government was squarely behind a fiscal eight ball.
It had been living beyond its means.
It had become heavy on bureaucracy and light on fiscal restraint.
Spending was out of control.
And a national recession was not only robbing us of revenues, but also adding to our costs as our people suffered layoffs and unemployment.
I will never forget the embarrassment of the state not paying its bills on time, and the anguish of people who were out of work.
They made lasting impressions on me and underscored the urgency of setting things right in Illinois.
After all, government, those of us assembled here today, exists to solve the problems its people encounter and to prevent those that can be anticipated.
We have done that.
Our ability to meet the needs of our people during those tough economic times, WITHOUT raising taxes was in serious question.
But we together responded to the challenge.
We charted a new direction for Illinois.
We stopped spending money we didn't have.
We streamlined state government.
We downsized it by thousands of employees.
We continued to meet our major obligations and to address new challenges by finding innovative ways to meet our responsibility.
We have prepared Illinois to enter the 21st Century capable of meeting any new challenges that lie ahead.
Illinois is no longer a deadbeat state.
We eliminated a mountain of Medicaid debt.
At last we are fully funding our pension systems.
And yes we have been paying and will continue to pay our bills on time.
We rescued our treasury from the brink of bankruptcy by imposing a new fiscal discipline.
And as long as I am Governor we will continue to be disciplined.
With our fiscal problems behind us some may be tempted to go on another spending binge as we saw in the '80s.
As you will see when I detail my budget for the next fiscal year next month there will be no spending binge.
I'm not proposing one.
I won't accept one.
And neither will the taxpayers.
This state also will stay on course when it comes to our economic development strategy.
We have significantly improved the climate for creating new jobs in this state.
Many, many of those anguished Illinoisans I listened to during my first days, weeks and months as Governor are working today.
We changed laws that put Illinois at a competitive disadvantage.
And we dramatically changed the thrust of our economic development efforts.
We turned away from trying to outbid other states for new businesses.
We turned toward helping business already here, businesses already employing Illinoisans, businesses already paying taxes to prosper and to expand.
And our economic strategy, just like our fiscal strategy, has worked.
Today things are much different in Illinois.
We are a national leader in economic recovery.
In the last five years, more than a half million jobs have been created in Illinois, nearly 71,000 just last year, which represented the largest increase in the Midwest and the second largest in the country.
Moreover, thousands of those new jobs were in manufacturing as our state outpaced the rest of the nation.
Illinois gained close to 7,000 manufacturing jobs last year at a job growth rate that more than doubled the national average, while the Midwest generally lost more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs.
Per capita income has increased 32 percent during the 1990's.
That's almost 10 percent better than the national average.
And unemployment is at its lowest rate in nearly a quarter century.
The export economy in Illinois continues to grow and prosper.
Direct exports have grown by 14 percent a year during the 1990s.
That is four times the rate of growth during the 1980s.
In fact, Illinois has led all the other major industrial states in export growth for two straight years, and we're going to keep making exports a top priority.
Indeed, we have changed this state's image from anti-business to pro-business.
Just last month, we took historic action that not only will keep more money in the pockets of Illinois workers but encourage their companies to add still more jobs to our economy.
Our deregulation of the electric utility industry is expected to save consumers, homeowners and businesses more than a half billion dollars a year.
And when it comes to state regulation of business in general, we are protecting workers, consumers, our environment and the bottom line by taking a reasonable approach.
You can regulate without over-regulating.
And we have by working with businesses in trail-blazing efforts to clean up contaminated sites and address other environmental problems.
We also are holding down the cost of doing business in Illinois.
And we are working to help new companies get a foothold in the business world.
In December, we implemented changes to the unemployment insurance program that guarantee the continued stability of the fund and jobless benefits, and we spared businesses from an $85 million tax hit in the process.
We have made more than $6 million in loans to new and small businesses that do not qualify for conventional loans, many of them owned by women or minorities or individuals with disabilities.
Next month, I expect to announce the first communities to participate in a program that will help assure tourism remains one of this state's leading and fastest growing industries.
Through this initiative we will further develop historic sites in Downstate Illinois.
Let there be no mistake about it.
Tourism is a major growing factor in creating jobs in Illinois.
It contributes $18 billion to our economy and employs well over a quarter million people in this state.
And this administration will continue to bolster and expand our tourism efforts in our world-class gateway city of Chicago and throughout Illinois.
And we also will continue pushing for a third major airport in the Chicago metropolitan area.
It is crucial to the economy of that area and the entire state as we look toward the 21st Century.
Just last month the National Aviation Review Commission warned of aviation gridlock at the nation's major airports including O'Hare.
The dominant airlines at O'Hare are fighting us on this.
But their opposition is not unusual.
They have fought progress before, including right here in Illinois.
If the major airlines had prevailed in the 1950s, there would be no O'Hare airport today.
Elsewhere on the economic front, I am urging this General Assembly to approve a modest, sensible proposal that will save tens of thousands of jobs in this state.
All segments of the horse racing industry have agreed on legislation to ensure that threatened industry survives.
And its survival, according to the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission, means keeping 37,000 jobs and $1.4 billion in our economy.
A strong, growing economy.
An effective, efficient and fiscally responsible state government.
Both are critical to making our state a great place to live and work.
But there must be more.
Each child in our state, each potential worker for the 21st Century, should have access to a quality education, regardless of where he or she lives.
Our streets and our schools must be safe.
All of our citizens, young and old, men and women, must be encouraged and helped to achieve maximum self-sufficiency.
There must be opportunity for all who seek opportunity.
The headlines of the '90s remind us too frequently that lives can be lost at any age.
But lives also can be saved at any age.
We must protect and nurture our children and families, our human resources.
And we must protect and nurture our natural resources.
We must prevent problems as well as solve them.
Or our economy will stop growing.
And our quality of life won't be what we want it to be, especially for our children and our grandchildren.
So let me discuss the progress we have made, and must continue to make in several key areas.
And I want to begin with education, because I strongly believe nothing is more important to the future of our state.
Last month we converted the rhetoric of three decades into reality.
We finally at long last, for the first time in the history of our state decreed that each and every school child in Illinois must be supported by an adequate level of funding.
We also launched a $3 billion school construction program, the first in 20 years, to provide quality learning environments throughout the state.
But as I have said many, many times from this and other podiums, money alone will not assure a quality education.
And together in the '90s we have taken major steps to make educators more accountable and to produce better results.
Chicago school reform comes immediately to mind.
For decades the rhetoric flew.
But as we did with school funding, we converted the rhetoric into reality.
We empowered the mayor, the new school management team he put into place, principals, teachers, parents and community leaders.
We gave them the flexibility and freedom to deal with the unusual and daunting problems of that system.
But we also demanded more accountability.
And today, the Chicago public school system, once a symbol of failure in urban education, is a model for reforming urban schools throughout the nation.
I believe strongly in public education.
I believe strongly in funding it fairly and adequately.
I believe strongly in local control of our schools.
I believe strongly that local school boards must have the flexibility to innovate free of mandates and red tape generated from Springfield.
And I believe strongly that local school boards, principals and teachers must be held accountable.
Those principles are embodied in the sweeping reforms we have enacted, not only for Chicago, but for schools throughout Illinois.
We established charter schools to stimulate innovation.
We authorized alternative schools to deal with disruptive students.
We've freed schools in all corners of Illinois to gain waivers from unnecessary mandates.
We set tough new academic standards for our students.
We now require teachers to teach for four years before they become fully certified.
And now they must renew their certificates every five years by demonstrating they have performed well in the classroom and worked on becoming even better professionals.
In the same vein, we have expedited the process for dismissing teachers who are not performing well.
But we need to build on these reforms, not rest on them.
Take school funding for instance.
There is unfinished business.
As I have said throughout my career in public life, we rely too heavily upon property taxes to fund our schools.
And we still do, even with the historic funding reform we enacted last month to raise up the poorer school districts in our state, and even with the success of property tax caps.
In my first State of the State address, I announced I was calling a special session of the General Assembly to win approval of property tax caps.
They have saved homeowners and businesses more than $800 million in the years since they were enacted.
The caps have proved effective in halting the staggering increases in property tax bills that had been occurring year after year, particularly in northeastern Illinois.
But they do not represent the fundamental reform I have advocated, proposed and continue to advocate.
The current system remains unfair.
We need to change it.
So I will soon appoint a blue-ribbon commission to develop recommendations that I hope will lead to a tax swap, less reliance on local property taxes, greater reliance on fairer taxes, like the income tax.
I am pleased that an extremely capable individual, Tim Bramlet, President of the Taxpayers Federation of Illinois, has agreed to head this commission.
It is a complex issue.
How would such a swap be implemented?
Should it impact businesses as well as homeowners?
But I believe the commission can thoroughly study the matter solicit public comment, and fashion a plan by the Dec. 31 deadline I am establishing.
I also believe there is unfinished business when it comes to the quality of teaching in our classrooms.
During the next decade, more teachers will begin their careers than in any other decade.
Research shows that the expertise of teachers is absolutely critical to the academic achievement of students.
So it is important for us to help teachers become the best they can be.
While serving on a national commission on teacher preparation, I learned Illinois like many other states should be doing better.
Future teachers in Illinois need better preparation.
Currently the state requires them to student-teach for just eight weeks.
That's only half a semester.
Those future teachers need more practical experience in the classroom and more guidance from seasoned teachers.
I believe they need to spend 16 weeks, one full semester, student-teaching in our schools.
I also believe we should take action to assure that fewer and fewer of our teachers are teaching outside of their areas of expertise.
Former State Superintendent of Education, Ted Sanders, who is now President of Southern Illinois University, is co-chairing a panel called the Illinois Policy Group on Teacher Quality.
It is formulating recommendations on these and many other issues.
And I will be asking the Board of Higher Education and the State Board of Education to take several actions that will help us assure we have top-quality people teaching our kids and the students of the 21st Century.
Meanwhile, we must continue to build on the substantial gains we have made in improving higher education in Illinois.
We have eliminated unnecessary layers of bureaucracy at the state level.
And we have demanded that our state universities themselves enact reforms.
They needed to streamline and they have.
They needed to put more emphasis on helping undergraduates to graduate in four years to be able to do so.
And they have.
The reforms they have made under the direction of the Board of Higher Education have won national recognition.
Our world-class universities and first-rate community colleges represent an important part of our commitment to the future.
And we have recognized that in many ways.
We have invested $45 million in our Distance Learning Initiative to give college and high school students access to additional education opportunities through new technology.
We have funded the construction of 21st Century facilities in which our professors can teach and our students can learn.
This year alone we will begin construction of a permanent campus for Heartland Community College in Bloomington-Normal.
We will build a new engineering building at SIU at Edwardsville.
We will increase classroom space at John A. Logan Community College in Southern Illinois.
And we will expand the Booth Library at Eastern Illinois University and start construction on a new agricultural library at the University of Illinois.
But our look to the future involves far more than bricks and mortar.
Last year, we acted to help future university and college students and their families pay for their college years.
Our new pre-paid tuition plan will help them save for college.
They will know in advance what fees and tuitions will be and they will pay for them at today's prices.
The pre-paid tuition plan recognizes that the ability of young people to reach their full potential depends on circumstances beyond the classroom.
That is something we must constantly keep in mind as we shape and pursue an agenda for Illinois.
If a child comes to her first-grade classroom malnourished, or with an undetected vision problem, or with problems at home, she is not going to benefit fully from what is available in that classroom even from a great teacher, even in one of our best schools.
We launched one of our most worthwhile programs, Project Success, because we realized that many school children and the schools themselves needed help.
We got parents involved.
We got neighborhoods and communities involved.
We established far better coordination among state and community human service agencies.
In neighborhoods and communities throughout Illinois, we established a network of effectively delivered services to which educators and parents could turn and get results quickly.
We found caring businesses to donate school supplies to children who can't afford them.
We found utility companies willing to work with families that are without electricity and struggling to pay their bills.
We found health care professionals willing to donate their services to help identify and address vision, hearing and other physical barriers to learning.
We found parents willing to make kids feel safer by escorting them to and from schools.
We started Project Success with six sites in 1992.
Since then it has expanded to 840 schools throughout Illinois.
And I am proud to announce today that within the next year we will make Project Success available to every one of the 3200 elementary and middle schools in the state of Illinois.
Kids, particularly disadvantaged kids, are doing better in school because of Project Success.
And we are doing much better in delivering human services and taking up the challenge of welfare reform because of what we learned from the success of Project Success.
You can't address the problems of a disadvantaged individual or family narrowly.
Typically, there are several problems that require a variety of services.
You can operate far more effectively and efficiently by doing a better job of coordinating services.
You need to get neighborhoods and communities, churches and the private sector involved.
Many of them once were involved, deeply involved.
They can, and they must be again.
To make their neighborhoods and communities safer, to help people who live within them become more productive and self-sufficient.
We have revolutionized the delivery of human services in Illinois.
We have abandoned the one-size-fits-all approach.
We know that not all wisdom resides in Springfield and certainly not in Washington, D. C. We are working with communities and neighborhoods in every corner of this state to address their problems in the most relevant ways.
We are listening to them.
We are also sharing responsibility with them.
And at the state level we have implemented the most sweeping reorganization of state government since the early 1900s.
Programs and services once scattered among a half dozen agencies, are now being administered and delivered by a single agency.
A family that turns to government for assistance now deals with a case manager, who can tap into several different services needed to address the problems of the family as a whole.
This agency, the Department of Human Services, reflects and embodies our revolutionary approach, one that is being seen as a beacon for the nation.
It also is spearheading welfare reform in Illinois.
While the nation was still debating welfare reform in the early and mid '90s, Illinois was charging ahead.
We rejected an approach that fostered dependence and instead adopted one that furthers independence.
Our nationally recognized Earnfare program provided thousands and thousands of former welfare recipients with work and the dignity of a paycheck.
We stopped penalizing welfare families when the father stayed with the family.
We stopped penalizing recipients who took part-time or temporary jobs.
We required teen-age mothers to finish their education and to live at home.
We required mothers with older children to seek and find work or risk having their benefits reduced.
And we required welfare recipients with substance abuse problems to undergo treatment.
Over the last year, we have doubled the number of welfare families in job training and placement programs to 40,000.
Because of our welfare-to-work initiatives, another 41,000 families moved from the public aid rolls to private payrolls in just the last 12 months.
That is a 32 percent increase in the families who were able to become self-sufficient over the previous year, and brings the total to more than 200,000 since January 1991.
Those are families who no longer depend on a government check but rely on themselves to earn a paycheck and the pride it brings.
We are beating the national timetable for welfare reform.
And Illinois last year recorded the lowest public aid caseload since the early 1970s.
Some critics of welfare reform have suggested welfare recipients are being punished.
That is certainly not what is driving reform in Illinois.
As a matter of fact, Illinois was among the first states to offer state-funded benefits to the most needy legal immigrants after Congress unwisely cut them off in the federal welfare reform bill.
Our program to provide assistance to thousands of immigrant children and to elderly or disabled immigrants cut off from food stamps gives them vital nutritional services.
By law that program will expire in August.
And I am asking you, the General Assembly, to extend it permanently.
No, welfare reform in Illinois isn't about punishment.
It's about encouraging, stimulating and helping people who can become self-sufficient to turn away from dependence on government and toward the pride of a paycheck.
But as we learned from Project Success, we need to look at the big picture.
We must recognize and we have recognized that roadblocks can sometimes stand in the way of a welfare parent becoming a working parent.
A parent who cannot find transportation to his or her job or can't arrange decent safe child care has far less chance of succeeding.
We responded with transportation programs in partnership with private employers, that help people get to work.
For example, the private and public sectors joined last year to create new welfare-to-work bus routes in the Chicago metropolitan area.
The buses take people working their way off welfare from the city to their suburban jobs at United Airlines.
We also have provided record funding for child care, $380 million this year alone.
That is an increase of $100 million from the previous year.
It is the second largest funding increase in the country.
And it means we are providing seven times more for child care than we were providing just seven years ago.
And we will do more.
For older children, structured activities after the school day ends can mean the difference between a life centered on success and a life scarred by drugs, gangs, pregnancy and dropping out of school.
Through our Teen Reach initiative, this administration will develop programs to provide activities and guidance for students after school while their parents are at work.
We also will build on the progress we have made in doing a better job of coordinating existing programs that serve kids under the age of 5.
Earlier this month, I asked citizens from throughout Illinois to help us identify the barriers to coordination of these early childhood programs.
Soon we will launch projects throughout Illinois, just as we did with Project Success, to help us determine the most effective ways of tearing down those barriers.
As people move from welfare to work, and as people find themselves in danger of moving from work to welfare, the need for child care services becomes even greater.
And we will respond.
Through community colleges, we will train welfare mothers to become licensed child care providers.
This will give us the double benefit of increasing child care in the community while creating employment opportunities for adults.
In addition, we will make low-cost loans available for those seeking to open child care facilities.
And we will help people cut through the red tape and get quick answers to questions about licensing and standards through our First Stop business information center.
Meanwhile, we must expand and improve upon our initiatives to help welfare recipients and other unemployed or underemployed citizens of our state find work.
Last fall, we launched an effort in Chicago to work with organizations and community agencies in focusing on the hard core unemployed.
Many have been on welfare for a long time, and perhaps all their lives.
And now we are prepared to take this initiative statewide and help people throughout this state who have seldom or never worked to become productive citizens.
We can make welfare reform succeed in this state just as we are making mental health reform succeed.
Together we have dramatically reformed our care and treatment of those with mental illness or disabilities.
We have transformed the system from one that relied heavily on state hospitals and institutions, to one where most who need our help are cared for in community-based facilities.
Near their loved ones.
In settings where they often can work, can be productive, can be as self-sufficient as possible.
Improving community mental health services has helped cut admissions to state hospitals in half.
And those who have been treated in state hospitals are far less likely to return because of the follow-up services those community agencies are providing.
Together we have prevented problems not just reacted to them.
I talked about the importance of prevention on my first day as governor.
Every dollar we spend on prevention means dollar after dollar we don't have to spend tomorrow correcting our failure to act.
My administration has nearly doubled the funding for early childhood education programs that help prevent kids from failing.
Immunizations of children are at an all-time high.
We're doing a better job coordinating Illinois' innovative programs to combat teenage pregnancy.
And the number of teenaged girls having babies is at an eight-year low.
We made managed care and pre-natal services more accessible to pregnant women.
And the infant mortality rate is at an all-time low, newborn deaths are down nearly 22 percent since 1990.
Lives can be lost at any age.
Lives also can be saved at any age.
Brenda's Help Me Grow campaign has helped more than 100,000 Illinois families get the information they needed about health and safety issues for their children.
Those calls to the Help Me Grow hotline prevented problems and, yes, they saved lives.
And next month Brenda will unveil a comprehensive wellness guide.
It will give mothers practical information on how to keep their babies and themselves healthy through pregnancy and the first two years of life.
The budget I announce next month will include funding for the Office of Women's Health, initiated by Brenda last year to expand awareness of health issues critical to women at mid-life.
Through a toll-free helpline, women can quickly get answers to their health questions or referrals to community-based resources.
This office, one of only five in the entire nation, will be in the forefront as we encourage women to adopt healthier lifestyles and take care of their health needs.
Meanwhile, I look forward to the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women that I appointed last year – recommendations that I hope will generate constructive dialogue and real progress.
I asked that commission, under the leadership of Paula Wolff, president of Governors' State University, to develop strategies that will help women overcome obstacles in their lives and in the workplace.
The commission is looking at issues such as equal pay, equal access to the lending market, safe and high-quality child care, strong enforcement of laws on the books to protect women from domestic violence and from sexual assault.
I am confident we can address these issues, just as we have addressed other tough issues involving families throughout Illinois.
By working together we have given all working Illinoisans the freedom to change jobs without fear of losing insurance coverage for themselves and their families.
And we have moved to give our working poor more stability in their lives by allowing them greater access to health care coverage for their children.
Too many of our low-income families are living without a safety net.
Too many have no medical insurance coverage at all.
They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.
But they cannot afford regular health insurance.
Earlier this month, my administration extended health care coverage to more than 40,000 uninsured children of the working poor.
That means they can get the regular check-ups, vision and hearing screenings, immunizations, prescription drugs and dental care that are so important to growing up healthy.
That means unexpected injury or illness will not drive those already strapped families into financial ruin.
We will extend that coverage to tens of thousands more uninsured children, and I look forward to working with this legislature to implement that program.
By covering more children of the working poor, we are helping even more families stay off the welfare rolls.
We are giving those kids a better chance to grow up healthy and strong.
We are making those families stronger.
And meanwhile we are going to help strengthen other families in which 70,000 Illinois children are being raised solely by a grandparent.
Currently, there are about 30 support groups for those grandparents.
That could double under the budget I announce next month.
At the same time, we need to help others of our senior citizens who need some nursing care but who want to retain the independence and dignity of living at home.
Tens of thousands of families in this state know what I'm talking about.
Senior citizens find they no longer can live independently in their homes.
But many feel they are imposing if they move in with their adult children and their families.
Or they are concerned about financially draining themselves or their families.
They do not need nursing home care.
They seek a less restrictive and less expensive alternative.
My administration has implemented a pilot program that will test the ability of the private sector to provide this alternative in the form of assisted living units.
And we will work closely with members of this General Assembly on this issue.
We also will expand the Illinois READS program by recruiting even more senior citizens to mentor and tutor young students.
It's the kind of program we like to encourage and support.
Seniors continue contributing to a better world.
Youngsters get a boost toward realizing their full potential.
And we must make sure on many fronts that kids get this support.
Lives can be lost at any age.
They also can be saved at any age.
We took the red tape out of adoption in the early days of this administration.
And the number of abused and neglected children who were placed in permanent, loving homes has increased nearly sixfold.
Adoptions of these deserving children doubled over the last year alone, and we expect to nearly double them again over the next two years.
As part of that effort, my administration next month will launch a partnership with employers throughout Illinois to recruit more adoptive parents by easing possible work-related concerns.
And I pledge to you today: Illinois will meet and surpass President Clinton's challenge to double the number of adoptions of abused and neglected children within the next four years.
We also will rely on our nationally acclaimed guardianship program.
It facilitates permanent placement with foster parents who don't want to adopt but want to provide caring homes for those kids.
Lives can be lost at any age.
They can be saved at any age.
And while we help more and more loving responsible adults to save the lives of children through adoption and guardianship, we also are insisting that other parents be responsible.
Each and every year of my administration we have collected a record amount of child support payments adding up to $1.5 billion.
That is nearly two-thirds of all the child support money taken in by state agencies since 1976.
In fact, our child support enforcement unit at the Department of Public Aid was recently honored with the Most Improved Award from the National Child Support Enforcement Association.
Our program to establish paternity - something crucial to child support collection - also has drawn national attention.
And we are adding a new weapon to our child support arsenal, a system to track new hires so we can collect child support through the workplace.
That innovation came from a task force headed by Lieutenant Governor Kustra.
Meanwhile, initiatives on other fronts are paying dividends as well.
In my 1993 State of the State address, I unveiled an initiative to intervene in the lives of high school dropouts.
Through interaction with the National Guard, at-risk youths learn discipline and gain inspiration to change the direction of their lives.
More than 2,800 youths have received their diplomas through the Lincoln's Challenge Program, and more than 1,000 of them went on to college and vocational schools.
Seated with Brenda in the gallery today are three young people who have at least three things in common.
Each dropped out of high school in the 1990s.
Each earned a GED diploma through Lincoln's Challenge.
All three went on to college.
And their success is typical of this important program.
I'd like for you to welcome these Lincoln's Challenge graduates: Nicole Jones of Chicago; Melissa Arnold of Decatur ;and Daniel Brautigan of Villa Park.
Please stand and be recognized.
Lives can be lost at any age.
Lives can be saved at any age.
And one of the ways to save lives is to protect our people from those who turn to crime, from those who disrupt lives and those who ruin lives those who take lives.
This administration has proposed, supported, and with the help of this Legislature, enacted laws that make sure sex offenders, drug kingpins, drive-by shooters and other criminals pay the price for their terrible crimes.
We now have a truth-in-sentencing law that guarantees these enemies of society will stay behind bars, where they belong, for a long long time.
And we have built the prisons to keep them there securely with as much safety as possible for those who guard them.
More than 8,600 prison beds have been added during my administration.
A 40 percent increase in prison capacity during the last seven years.
We have established a gang-free prison.
We ended family picnics that increased the risk of contraband being smuggled into the prisons.
We took down the curtains that inmates put in their cells to hide their activities from prison guards.
We have changed the prison at Pontiac to a total segregation unit for undisciplined inmates.
We have implemented drug testing.
And we are doing more.
In coming weeks the Department of Corrections will begin moving 500 of the state's most unruly and dangerous inmates into the new SuperMax prison at Tamms.
At the same time the Illinois State Police will put new technology to use in our war against crime.
Technology to make positive identification on suspects far more quickly.
Technology to do more effective and efficient background checks on applicants for jobs involving care of children, the elderly and the sick.
And technology to put motorists in touch more rapidly and easily with the State Police when they encounter trouble on our roads.
Last September, the state police teamed up with the University of Illinois and the Illinois Council for the Prevention of Violence to form the nation's first regional institute for community policing.
And we also have established six community policing support centers to work with local law enforcement agencies and neighborhoods.
Meanwhile we also have taken historical, monumental strides to protect our natural resources.
I can think of few things more important than providing our children with an environment better than the one we inherited from our parents and grandparents.
We have launched Conservation 2,000 and many other initiatives to preserve and enhance our natural resources, to conserve our precious Illinois top soil and to greatly expand outdoor recreational opportunities.
We have added or improved 475 miles of new trails throughout Illinois.
And this year we will add another 50 miles of trailway to the Grand Illinois Trail that will cross 18 northern counties to link the shore of Lake Michigan to the banks of the Mississippi River.
I am very proud of our Illinois River Initiative, led by Lieutenant Governor Kustra, that will restore and protect this important inland waterway and its watershed.
Moreover, this year we will provide additional resources at Savanna, at Joliet, at Site M in Cass County, at Sangchris Lake State Park and along the Little Vermilion River, where we are preserving natural areas for future generations.
We should be, and will be held accountable for what we have done in the twilight of the 20th Century to strengthen our state in the 21st Century.
Accountability is important.
We demand it of others.
We should demand it of ourselves.
And I believe we can strengthen this state by amending our state constitution in two key areas to enhance accountability.
Education and the judiciary.
If education is state government's top priority, and I think we all agree it is, the individual who should be most accountable is the state's chief executive officer: the governor.
And yet the accountability is blurred today.
The governor has no direct-line authority over those who implement our education policies at the state level.
I am asking this General Assembly to put before the voters a Constitutional amendment putting the Governor clearly in charge through a Cabinet-level Department of Education.
Then the next Governor, whoever that person may be, can be more accountable and responsible for our public education system, its successes and its shortcomings.
The other constitutional amendment I am proposing involves the Illinois Courts Commission which sits in judgment of judges.
Last spring this little-known commission received a great deal of attention.
Its impartiality was called into question.
And public trust in our judicial system was diminished.
We need to amend the Illinois Constitution to help restore that lost faith.
I am proposing that we expand the commission so that the judging of judges is not left entirely up to their fellow judges.
And I am proposing that the commission be required to adopt formal and public rules that govern its procedures.
Meanwhile, I am again calling for this General Assembly to pass additional ethics legislation.
We have rewritten our purchasing act, including more accountability and more safeguards against abuse.
Now it is time to extend the ethics reforms that state agencies under my jurisdiction are already following to every other branch of state government.
By Executive Order last summer, I have prohibited employees under my control and their families from accepting gifts valued at more than $50 from companies and individuals with whom they deal.
I am asking once again that this General Assembly write those reforms into law so they apply to every area of state government.
And I am asking you once again to establish a state ethics commission by law to oversee conflict-of-interest-issues in all agencies, in all branches of government.
As I told you last year, I believe we should also continue reforming our campaign finance laws.
The public and the media should be able to easily determine where political candidates get their money, how much they get and how they spend it.
We now require that campaign finance reports be available on the Internet.
That is a good first step.
But I believe we should make the information even more accessible and more complete.
We should require contributors to fully identify themselves, including their full names, addresses, occupations and employers.
And we should increase the penalties for those political committees that do not file the proper financial disclosures in full or on time.
Over the last seven years we have conquered many challenges.
We have accomplished much for the people of Illinois.
We have tried to be a smarter government not a status quo government.
A better government not a bigger government.
But our job is not done.
We must continue to search for the child who needs our helping hand.
We must redouble our efforts to make our neighborhoods safer.
Our senior citizens more secure.
And our families stronger and healthier.
We must continue to promote quality education that will prepare our children and grandchildren for the challenges they will face.
We must challenge the conventional wisdom.
And we must challenge ourselves.
Lives can be lost at any age.
Lives also can be saved at any age.
Let us continue to build an Illinois for the 21st Century where our children andtheir children can see their dreams fulfilled.
Thank you.
