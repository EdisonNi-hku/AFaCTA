SENTENCES
"In a State of the State Address, as in life, it’s important to assess where we are, remember how we got here, decide where we want to go, and then determine how best to get there."
"Comparing the state of our state today with conditions, when I took office two years ago, we have made important progress."
"We have much more work still ahead of us; however, we are on the way to a better Minnesota."
"According to our Department of Employment and Economic Development, there are over 72,000 more jobs available in Minnesota today than when I took office two years ago."
"Almost 52,000 of those jobs were added in the past year."
Minnesota’s job growth in 2012 was the 12th best among all 50 states; and we outperformed three of our four neighbors.
Iowa ranked 30th best; South Dakota was 44th.
"Wisconsin, which by the way is open for business, helped bring up the rear at 42nd."
"And, help spread the word across the St. Croix, their unemployment rate last month was 20% higher than ours, while our per capita income was 12% higher than theirs."
"Only North Dakota, in the Upper Midwest, topped us in job growth last year, and their percent increase led the nation."

"asp No one should be satisfied, or complacent."
"However, these and many other improvements are encouraging."
"We have also made great progress in restoring fiscal responsibility and operational integrity to Minnesota government, which also tells us a lot about what got us to where we are today."
I became Governor after a decade of deficits in both our federal and state governments.
"They squandered their positions of financial stability amidst consistent economic growth, which they enjoyed at the beginning of the 21st century, and which were then projected to continue for at least the next decade."
Few politicians can resist the opportunity to cut taxes.
"President Bush proposed two large tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which I opposed as a Senator and Congress passed."
"In Minnesota, Governor Ventura convinced the legislature to reduce income tax rates in both 1999 and 2000."
Both leaders assumed that the strong economic growth during the last half of the 1990’s would continue.
"Unfortunately, both were wrong."
"Also wrong were the politicians and economists, who promised that cutting taxes would lead to more economic growth, jobs, and revenues."
"Instead, the two federal tax cuts were soon followed by two recessions, the second the most severe since the Great Depression."
"In the decade after Minnesota’s income tax reductions, our economy fared worse than the nation and most other states."
"And at both the federal and state levels, big tax cuts followed by serious recessions produced large budget deficits, which threaten our current fiscal strength and future economic prosperity."
The solutions to those deficits were very clear.
"However, they were also very painful; so they were postponed, then postponed again, and again."
"Unfortunately, avoiding financial problems usually makes them worse."
Fixing them then becomes even harder.
"Thus, when I became Governor in January 2011, the State Budget Forecast projected a $6 billion deficit for the next two fiscal years."
It took six months of difficult negotiations with the Republican-controlled legislature to finally agree upon a balanced budget.
Those decisions were hard for all of us and far more painful for all the Minnesotans denied needed services and assistance.
"But we had to enact a balanced budget, and we did."
"Since then, an improving state economy and savings from health care reforms have boosted our finances by $2.5 billion for this biennium, enabling us to restore our reserves and repay over 60 percent of the previous school shifts."
"We have repaired much of the fiscal damage we inherited, but we’re not done yet."
"We face another deficit, projected at $1.1 billion, for the next biennium; and we still owe our schools another $1.1 billion."
My budget for the next biennium would lift us out of this miserable deficit-to-deficit cycle.
"It would eliminate the $1.1 billion deficit, balance the biennial budget, and begin the following biennium with a projected surplus that would enable us to pay back the remainder of the school shift."
My proposals have already aroused considerable controversy.
Such debate is healthy in our democracy.
The genius of our system of governance is that no one gets to have it all her or his way.Starting with the governor.
Some will characterize any legislative changes in my budget as my loss.
"I don’t see it that way, at all."
"The winners I care about are the people of Minnesota, whose collective best interests I was elected to represent."
As were you in the legislature.
"Whatever outcome does the most to improve the lives of the most Minnesotans, makes winners of us all."
"However, before we refocus on that controversy, I think we should look farther ahead."
"Former Governor Arne Carlson liked to say, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there."
I appreciate that wisdom more every year.Where do we want to go?
"Where do we want Minnesota to be in a year, in a decade, or more?"
We will not agree on every aspect.
"However, if we can discover our shared goals, perhaps we will find greater accord on how best to achieve them."
We can also better assess whether the path we’re now on will lead us to them.
This perspective also broadens the time horizon of our decision-making.
"We must consider not only what is right for Minnesota today, but also what is best for Minnesota in the future."
"So, what do I believe offers the best hope for a better future to most Minnesotans?"
"I want Minnesota to provide the best jobs for our citizens, the best lives for their families, and the best environment for our businesses to provide those jobs."
"Those who measure “business climate” only by tax rankings will question my strategy, although many surveys rate Minnesota lower in overall taxes than most are led to believe."
"We’re 15th among the states in taxes, according to the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence."
And we rank 11th highest in per capita income.
"However, Minnesota has not been considered a “low tax” state during my almost four decades of public service."
"And the facts show that states offering businesses and their top executives the lowest taxes usually offer the rest of their citizens the lowest incomes, the fewest public services, and the highest crime rates."
"Furthermore, their job growth typically lags “high value and high performance” states like Minnesota."
"So, yes, I absolutely meant what I said."
"I want Minnesota to provide the best jobs for our citizens, the best lives for their families, and the best support for our businesses to provide those jobs."
"I want Minnesota state government to provide the best value for everyone’s hard-earned tax dollars and the most efficient, effective services anywhere."
"I want Minnesota to offer the world’s best educations for ALL of our citizens, children and grandchildren."
"Educations which begin early in life, and continue throughout life; so that all of us can learn the skills, and relearn the new skills, necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing and ever-more-competitive global economy."
"We know that our exceptional citizens, who are more inventive, harder working, and more productive than people anywhere, have been the most important contributors to our state’s economic progress and social vitality."
Most of us agree that our citizens’ superior educations have been crucial to our previous successes.
"And many of us agree that providing all Minnesotans with the best, most advanced, and yet affordable educational opportunities will be even more essential to their future success, and thus to ours."
I will return shortly to consider whether we are on a path toward that goal.
"I want all of us, and especially Minnesota’s future generations, to live in a healthy environment; in safe, inclusive communities; and with the same rights and protections as every other American citizen."
"A healthy life starts with, and depends upon, clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, protected natural environments to enjoy, and a secure ecological future."
"No one can endure the severe droughts or floods of recent years; endure (or, some, enjoy) our milder, snow-scarce winters; lather on sunscreen to walk outdoors without being greatly alarmed."
"If you’re not, talk with my good friend and world-premier polar explorer, Will Steger, who is here tonight, about the drastic climate changes he has witnessed."
"Even more alarming is that our state and our nation are still not doing enough to reverse this path toward global catastrophe, before it is too late."
"In Minnesota, we have made real progress in areas like energy conservation, more efficient farming and manufacturing practices, and the development and use of clean, renewable energy, especially wind energy, instead of polluting fossil fuels."
The question is: are we progressing fast enough?
"Are we doing all we can to utilize other renewables, such as solar, and also to make Minnesota the best place to locate these new industries and their jobs?"
"Many of you, who served in previous legislatures, deserve great credit for your pioneering work to expand our use of clean energy, including Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon and former Senator Ellen Anderson, who is also here tonight."
"I challenge this legislature to work again with our state’s visionary clean energy advocates, large energy providers, large energy users, other stakeholders, and my administration to use your past achievements as springboards for Minnesota’s next big leap toward a sustainable energy future."
"Safe, inclusive communities benefit all Minnesotans."
"Doing everything possible to stop the terrible acts of violence, which end young lives and victimize innocent people, should be an urgent priority for all of us."
Those strategies deserve and require more time than I have available tonight.
"Let me focus on one initiative, however, and enlist everyone’s support."
Studies show that the highest incidences of juvenile delinquency and teenage pregnancy occur during the weekday hours after school.
"Years ago, there were more organized, supervised after-school programs for young people."
"The ones remaining do exceptional work; but there are not enough of them, and they struggle to find the funding to continue."
"Two years ago, I challenged businesses to “Adopt a School."
"Some businesses, to their great credit, were already involved in improving our schools, and others accepted my challenge."
"Some, however, especially smaller businesses have told me it was just too big an assignment to adopt an entire school."
"So, I invite you to “Adopt an After-School Program."
"It might involve a financial contribution, the donation of new or used equipment, or your employees as part-time volunteers."
"There are so many from which to choose, and so many young people who need better options than unoccupied time, streets, and gangs."
"In the coming weeks, we will be releasing more information on how you can help."
"In the meantime, if you need help finding a worthy program, give me a call."
"I believe most of you have my home phone number by now.If not, it’s 651-201-3468."
"For the next two weeks, however, I’m taking calls at home only from “Adopt an After-School Program” volunteers."
"On anything else, please call my office, at 651-201-3499."
"Let me mention one other cause, which is controversial, but consistent with my faith and my principles."
"And, more importantly, consistent with this country’s founding principles and its Constitution."
"I believe that every Minnesotan should have the freedom to marry legally the person she or he loves, whether of the same or other sex."
"Last year, Minnesotans began a conversation about why marriage matters, and we found our common belief that it is about love, commitment, and responsibility."
"I want Minnesota to be a state, which affirms that freedom for one means freedom for everyone, and where no one is told it is illegal to marry the person you love."
