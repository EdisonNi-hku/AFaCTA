SENTENCES
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Legislature and Fellow Kansans: Tonight marks my fourth appearance as Governor in which I have the privilege and responsibility to report on the state of the State."
"Public service is a high calling, and I am honored by the opportunity to serve the people of Kansas."
I am also proud of the partnership I enjoy with the Kansas Legislature.
Together we have provided unprecedented tax relief for Kansans.
Together we have strengthened our future by investing in education.
"Together we have created initiatives to protect the environment, to more effectively deal with juvenile and violent crime, to more fairly administer tax laws, to effectively implement welfare to work, and to create jobs and build a stronger economy."
"We have achieved a great deal, and I thank you for your support and partnership."
Our past efforts have contributed to a state of the State that is excellent.
"Record-low unemployment, with more Kansans employed than any time in our history, and strong growth in all sectors of the economy have provided a sound economic base."
We are proud of our place in the global economy.
"The world is consuming Kansas-grown grain and meat, flying Kansas-built aircraft and using Kansas-built machinery, while Kansas-based services meet their needs."
The fiscal condition of Kansas is outstanding.
"This is confirmed by the recent Standard and Poor's rating of AA+, the highest rating possible for the State of Kansas."
"In reaching that conclusion, Standard & Poor's noted as a significant factor in this high rating the fact that Kansas has ""conservative fiscal management and sound financial operations with ample statutory-mandated cash reserves."
This AA+ rating confirms Kansas is financially sound.
"We have minimal debt, we do not overspend, and we prudently maintain a ""rainy-day"" fund."
We must not deviate from these conservative policies.
Short-term political gain shall not be substituted for long-term fiscal responsibility.
"We cannot spend money we do not have, nor spend money we hope will be there."
"As I have said before, there is no Kansas credit card."
"While the state of the State demands our attention, the future of the State requires our vision.My message will be simple."
"There are taxes that can and should be reduced, and investments that can and should be made to build a better Kansas."
"Together, we have made history: at no other time have the people of Kansas been given three consecutive years of tax relief."
"That's a record we can be proud of, but more importantly, a record we will add to with more tax cuts this year."
"Let me share my proposals for fair, significant, and effective tax relief."
"Tax Cuts Single Taxpayers: Last year, I asked you to address the inequity between single and married taxpayers."
"To add a tax burden on young people starting their careers, on single parents struggling to keep their families intact, or on those who have lost their spouse just isn't right."
"You agreed; but because we lacked the financial resources, the decision was made to phase in tax justice over four years.Now we have the resources."
"On behalf of the more than 500,000 Kansans who will receive a 20 percent reduction this year, I strongly urge you to provide tax justice to single taxpayers."
"Income Tax: In our efforts over the past three years to provide tax relief to Kansans, we have not dealt adequately with the income tax."
Relief is due to all who pay income taxes.
"Therefore, I am asking the legislature to support: increasing the standard deduction by $200 for singles; $400 for the head of a household; and $600 for married couples."
"increasing the personal exemption by $100 from $2,000 to $2,100."
enacting a 10 percent earned income tax credit.
"When the federal earned income tax credit was expanded in 1986, President Ronald Reagan called it ""."
"the best anti-poverty, the best job creation, the best pro-family measure to come out of Congress."
I agree and ask your support for a state credit equal to 10 percent of the federal amount for Kansans.
"And finally, Kansas is clearly out of step with the rest of the nation on the taxation of machinery and equipment."
My proposal begins the process of removing this business inequity by providing a 15 percent income tax credit for property taxes paid on machinery and equipment.
"These four proposals, along with reducing the single taxpayer rate, provide major income tax relief for Kansans."
Inheritance Tax: Kansas must address its death taxes.
"In analyzing this issue, it became abundantly clear our inheritance tax is much too high and much too complicated."
"Kansans already pay taxes on income when it is earned, taxes on property while it's owned, and taxes on goods and services when they are purchased.That's enough taxing."
It is time for Kansans to have the lowest inheritance taxes possible in this country.
This is a tax reduction for all Kansans.
"Just ask the store owners on main street in your town, the farmers or ranchers in rural Kansas, the retired workers who own their own homes and have savings."
"They can't pass along their business, their property, or their savings without the State of Kansas imposing this unjust penalty."
"Therefore, I am recommending on July 1 of this year, Kansas move to a federal pick-up estate tax under which 90 percent of estates will be entirely exempt from federal and state death taxes."
"Property Tax: Continuing to reduce the uniform school mill levy is a goal we all share, and I recommend the levy be reduced to 23 mills for 1998 and 1999."
"This would represent a total reduction, through our partnership, of more than one third of the state-imposed property tax levy since we began these efforts just two years ago."
"Food Sales Tax Rebate: Last year in my State of the State message, I urged you to expand the sales-tax-on-food rebate by nearly doubling from $13,000 to $25,000 the income eligibility requirement, and returning dollars to more families who most need assistance."
This proposal made sense then; and it makes sense now.
"And I promise you, we will administratively make this program work."
The families with the least to spend must have more of our focus.
"In the last few months, there has been much talk about sales tax on food."
"This proposal gives us an opportunity to provide relief, not rhetoric."
Also included in my recommendations are tax relief initiatives which provide deductions for savings for all post-secondary education; sales tax exemptions for certain non-profits; tax simplicity and fairness issues; and exemptions pertaining to the severance tax on oil.
"In addition, I propose we increase the exemption for personal property from $250 to $500."
This is a common-sense proposal to reduce an unnecessary paperwork burden on Kansas businesses.
"In total, this tax relief package will cut the taxes Kansans must pay by $178.5 million next fiscal year and more than $200 million dollars on an annual basis."
"Finally, I ask you to extend the moratorium on unemployment insurance taxes for calendar year 1999 which will allow business men and women throughout Kansas to keep an additional $217 million to invest in their businesses, rather than send to Topeka."
"These tax cuts are significant in size, balanced in scope, fair in their inclusions of all Kansans, and consistent with conservative fiscal policy."
Added to tax cuts previously enacted by this Administration and the Kansas Legislature -- at the turn of the century -- we will have reduced the tax burden on Kansans by $3.3 billion.
I am fully aware some will not find our tax relief efforts adequate.
"They have but one song to sing, one slogan to shout."
But they underestimate; they undervalue; and they do not understand the Kansans I know.
"Kansans are not selfish, nor greedy.They want balance."
"They may not hire special interests, but they convey the interest they have in building a better future."
"They believe in investing in the Kansas of tomorrow, and so do I."
The following are a few of the highlights of my proposals to build a better Kansas.
"Investments in Children, Education and Training Educating our children has, is, and will always be a priority of this Administration."
"Except for in our homes, nowhere is the future of Kansas more influenced than in our classrooms."
"The following are some of my investments in our children's education: We should increase the base-budget-per-pupil expenditure by $35 to $3,705; We should increase the budget to provide special education financing at 85 percent of cost; We should provide $10 million to fund a fifth year of high correlation weighting; We should increase by more than 20 percent our support for at-risk children; We should add nearly $2 million to increase support for the parents as teachers program; and, We should commit $5 million to expand early head-start for children ages 3 to 5, so thousands more children receive the benefits of this program."
"Combined with other initiatives in the budget, my recommendations will provide new funding next year of $84 million --or a 4.1 percent increase--for elementary and secondary education."
"Regents institutions, Washburn, community colleges and area vocational technical schools also will have increased operating support."
"Because educating adults and building a stronger workforce is critical to our continued economic success, I am adding $600,000 to the Kansas Industrial Training and Kansas Industrial Re-training programs, and $1 million for capital improvements for area vocational technical schools."
This 50 percent increase will enable them to even better prepare more skilled workers for the Kansas workforce.
"In the history book, American Commonwealth, printed in 1888, it is noted that the Kansas Senate Education Committee demonstrated a commitment to excellence in education."
"One of the proposals to accomplish this goal was ""."
to have a Webster's dictionary in every school.
"While our commitment to excellence hasn't changed, the times and needs have."
"In our quest for excellence, I am recommending major technology investments in the amount of $23 million for K-12, Regents institutions, Washburn and community colleges, area vocational technical schools, School for the Blind, School for the Deaf, and assistive technology for special education students."
Children who are not healthy cannot take advantage of these education initiatives.
"To address the critical problem in which more than 60,000 Kansas children typically go uninsured, I am recommending $12 million in state funds to match $30.8 million in federal money for providing health insurance coverage and guaranteeing our children's right to health care."
Investments in the Environment and Natural Resources I believe all Kansans care deeply about their environment and natural resources.
"To continue this Administration's past initiatives, I recommend: $800,000 to finance the Kansas Water Quality Buffer Initiative and restore riparian areas of targeted watersheds in the Kansas Lower Republican River basin; $1 million per year over the next five years to leverage $20 million in loans for providing more communities with critical water system upgrades; $500,000 from the State Water Plan to honor the State's water quality obligations under the Federal Clean Water Act; $150,000 for the Kansas Geological Survey to begin a field-wide study of how best to explore, produce and regulate gas and oil in the Hugoton fields; and, $418,500 combined for Kansas State University: 1) to conduct state-of-the-art research on how to more efficiently use water from the Ogallala aquifer; and 2) to enhance on-going research of confined animal lagoons and ensure protection of our groundwater."
"While protecting our environment and natural resources, we must also enhance the opportunity for all Kansans to enjoy them."
We have neglected our parks infrastructure to the point of embarrassment.
"I am asking you to invest $10 million to be spent over three years to ensure our parks are accessible, useable, and reflect the pride we have in our state."
Investments in People Those who served Kansas and are part of the KPERS system have not had a cost of living adjustment for four years.
"With the strong performance of our system's investments, it is time to address that issue."
I am recommending a three percent increase for all KPERS retirees.
"Last fall, in this chamber, I addressed nearly 400 State employees from throughout Kansas."
"They were equipment operators, those who protect us on the highway, and those who serve us in the offices of government."
My message was of appreciation for their willingness to do more and an encouragement to serve Kansans even better.
"Personally delivering this message to them was important because during our past three years, we have reduced the size of government by more than 3,000 employees."
"We are asking our employees to do more, and therefore -- because they are our greatest asset -- we must support their effort."
I am proud of our State employees and particularly proud of the leadership my Cabinet has shown.
I recommend the equivalent of a 4 percent increase for all State employees.
They are doing more with less and have earned this recommendation.
There are numerous other investments in my budget designed to build a better Kansas.
"In reviewing my budget recommendations, please note the one-time tax payment of $66.6 million we received is allocated to one-time, not on-going, expenditures."
"Regardless of how you choose to allocate these funds, I expect them to be used for one-time costs."
"In spite of these aggressive initiatives, we have been able to propose a budget from the state general fund that is less than the rate of inflation -- a budget that grows by only 2.5 percent."
"Issues of Public Policy In every session, there are public policy issues not directly related to the spending plan which are important and must be debated."
"There are too many to mention in the time allotted here, but let me highlight and comment on a few."
"Board of Tax Appeals: Last year, we crafted and enacted the most significant tax policy in more than a decade, the Taxpayer Fairness Act."
"Now that we have addressed fairness, we should continue the discussion in terms of efficiently and effectively adjudicating tax disputes."
I have proposed a structure to allow the Board of Tax Appeals to better perform its role.
I urge your input on and consideration of this issue.
Retail Wheeling: It is clear to me there ultimately will be a restructuring of utilities providing electric power.
"My expectation is that whatever Kansas does, we will need complete assurance the Kansas consumer -- rural and urban -- is protected, and municipalities and the industry are treated fairly."
Legislation restructuring this industry should address these critical concerns.
"Ethics and Campaign Finance Reform: For the fourth year in a row, I ask you to help restore the confidence of people in their government by enacting meaningful ethics legislation."
"Two areas I strongly encourage include providing immediate subpoena powers for the Commission on Governmental Standards and Conduct, and requiring disclosure of third party dollars spent in the election process."
To not give the commission this subpoena power is to severely limit their ability to carry out the responsibility the Legislature has given them.
Let's empower them to do their job.
The issue of third party spending in campaigns is an issue of disclosure.
It is not an issue of restricting citizens' rights.
All we ask for is information on the source of their money and how it was spent.
Kansans have the right to know who is trying to influence them in the political process.
Partial Birth Abortion: An issue of great importance to all Kansans is public policy regarding abortion.
This issue demands conscientious thought by all of us.
Thoughtful people can find common ground on even the most challenging issues.
"There are those sitting in this chamber that showed courage and commitment and brought divergent views together to achieve passage last year of an excellent bill, the Woman's Right to Know."
I was proud to be part of that effort and proud of those here tonight who led it.
I believe there is another area where we can join together.
I strongly urge passage of a bill to ban partial birth abortions.
The argument about when this procedure is done or how many times it's done is not the issue.
The issue is that it is an abhorrent procedure that is currently legal in Kansas; and it should be banned so it will never be performed in Kansas.
"Conclusion Tonight I have shared my strong commitment to provide fair, significant and effective tax relief and to invest in building a better Kansas."
"When I first addressed you in January 1995, I quoted Carl Becker."
He reminded us that part of the heritage of pioneers was dealing with a new frontier.
"He conveyed to us that, without vision, a frontier cannot be transformed from what we have into what we dream."
We are entering a new frontier.
We are on the threshold of a new century.This budget is historic.
It is the last full fiscal year budget before the year 2000.
"Our vision must be guided by good public policy, not compromised by political expediency."
We will not sacrifice opportunities for the next generation by appeasing special interest demands today.
"This plan balances the need for fair, significant and effective tax relief with the need to build a better Kansas."
That balance is my commitment to the people of Kansas.Thank you and good night.
