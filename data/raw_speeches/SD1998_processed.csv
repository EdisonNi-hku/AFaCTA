SENTENCES
"Thank you very much.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you very, very much.Mr. Speaker.Ms.Lieutenant Governor."
"Mr. Chief Justice and Constitutional Officers and you, Ladies and Gentlemen of the South Dakota Legislature."
This is the time when the Governor comes before you to give the State-of-the-State message.
"It’s always done in January, and it’s always done in the cold."
"You know, as we assembled last year, and as we began to go through what was the year 1997, we convened under as difficult a circumstances as probably has been done for decades in South Dakota."
It really was a time of adversity.
"Throughout the Legislative Session, in the period of time that you, Ladies and Gentlemen, were here, South Dakota was suffering; and it was suffering in as significant a way as it could due to weather elements."
"It continued on after you ladies and gentlemen left, and we moved into the spring, and the thaws came, and the water came."
"I don’t think there were any of us, any of us in South Dakota, that didn’t think that we were under as much adversity as you could possibly be in and the outlook really looked grim."
"We thought it was going to be a year of adversity, because that’s the way it started for the first couple of months."
"The elements were terrible, but there are a lot of things in South Dakota that weren’t."
"First of all, in the political sense, and I mean with the small ""p,"" the nonpartisan political sense, the government really came together."
"All the branches of the government, all the elected officials irrespective of political party, really turned-to and decided they were going to do the work of the people of South Dakota."
"I can report to you, ladies and gentlemen, and to the people of this state, that in all the years I’ve had the privilege of serving in public life, I’ve never had a better working relationship with the two United States Senators and the Congressman that represent the State of South Dakota in Washington."
"Putting the politics aside, they’re a pleasure to work with."
There isn’t a single request that we make of them to do something or to move forward with some effort on behalf of the people of this state that they don’t turn to immediately.
"Even just the other evening, we had the crisis with respect to those four students down there at that college in Sioux Falls, when all of a sudden there were a hundred and sixty of them that were faced with the prospect of having—many of them having paid their hard-earned money, or the moneys that they’d borrowed."
"Late in the afternoon, I called the congressional delegation and within five minutes were able to have a conference call with Congressman Thune’s office, Senator Daschle’s office, Senator Johnson’s office and we were able to immediately start working on a plan on less than twenty minutes’ notice."
"I can submit to you it’s unheard of with any other state, the ability that we have to work together."
"South Dakota works, and I’m pleased to report, as I come before you today that South Dakota’s working."
"I realize full well over the next several weeks we’re going to have our political discussions, but it’s my responsibility today, as I come before the people of this state and this Legislature to give Bill Janklow’s and this administration’s perspective as to the state of the state."
What are the state of affairs in the State of South Dakota?
"And I think, by and large, with respect to virtually most the areas that have been the trouble areas that we’ve had to deal with over the last few decades, we’ve moved forward with great strides—all of us have—have moved forward with great strides in terms of bringing about solutions, solving problems and preventing problems."
"You know, historically, we have to bring some kind of perspective to the Executive and Legislative Branches."
"The Judicial Branch’s responsibility, as we all know, is to interpret what it is that the Legislature passes and the Governor may sign into law or what becomes law, interpret the Constitution."
But those of us that make the rules and those of us that administer the rules; we have to bring a certain philosophy to it.
My personal philosophy has always been that there’s probably a thousand things that we could be working on.
"I think one of the fallacies of government, historically, is that governments always try and do too many things at one time and not get that much done."
"My personal philosophy has always been, as I say as I travel around South Dakota and I just use the figure figuratively, but rather than trying to do a hundred things and getting them all done at 10 percent, I’ve always felt it’s better off to maybe try and address 10 things and get them done at 100 percent and then get them behind you."
"Unfortunately, we hear too often about all things that out-of-staters have to say that are negative about South Dakota."
"Frankly, we read in the media all the time how we rate a ""D,"" or a ""C,"" or a 9, or a 49, or a 50, or something else, always by people rating us and organizations, frankly, that have an agenda of one sort or another that they’re pushing."
"That’s fine, but what I thought I’d do today, and I’ve got some special people to come here today, I thought we ought to take just a little bit of a look at some of the people that really make a difference nationally in South Dakota and some of the things about South Dakota that make a difference."
Over the past 10 years the State of South Dakota is number one in the nation for the growth in manufacturing jobs.
We’ve grown over 74 percent in the number of manufacturing jobs in this state in the past decade.
"As a matter of fact, the Omaha World Herald, about 14 days ago, wrote a news story for the region wherein they indicated that the manufacturing growth in jobs in South Dakota—percentage wise, because we’re dealing with size—the growth in manufacturing jobs in South Dakota over the past five years exceeds the States of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming."
South Dakota’s the number one State in the Union in the percentage of its graduates from medical school that go into family practice residency.
The one area where we sorely need individuals to locate outside of the metropolitan areas and go out to where people live in rural areas.
The State of South Dakota was number one in the number of Job Service individuals—and there’s a gentleman here today.
"Mr. Lloyd Schipper—I’ve asked him to sit above the clock behind me, if Lloyd would stand up—Lloyd Schipper is the individual that works for the State of South Dakota in the Labor Department who, he and his team, are responsible for having us placed number one in the nation last year in the number of individuals who secured jobs that applied for them through the Job Service."
There’s a lady up there by the name of Julie Osness.
Julie Osness has worked for the Department of Social Services for many years.
"For the last two years in a row, South Dakota’s been the number one State in the Union in terms of the efficiency and the productivity and the accuracy in our Food Stamp operation."
"As a matter of fact, last year we received a bonus of hundreds of thousands of dollars from the federal government at the end of the year for the work which Julie and her team had done in putting us into the accuracy rate that we were in."
"The State of South Dakota, from 1995 to 1996, we were second in the nation in per capita growth in income."
Is that good enough for those of us that live here?No it isn’t.
"But, it clearly shows that South Dakota’s headed and moving in the right direction in terms of the economic growth that it has to have to give our people the greater opportunities and the better opportunity that economic growth can bring both to a state and to individuals."
We’re number two in the nation in the employment of individuals with disabilities.
We’re number two in the nation on the Small Business Survival Index.
The Small Business Survival Index is a rating agency from the Small Business Administration that uses 11 criteria to gauge the economic climate of a state that’s conducive to the growth of small business.
The State of South Dakota is number three in nation in the last year in the percentage of its high school students that graduated through high school.
We’re third in the nation in the percent of our budget that is spent on transportation.
The reason that that’s important is it shows the incredible commitment that our people make to take care of a transportation infrastructure that’s immense taking into perspective the size of the population that we have in this state.
South Dakota was also fourth in the nation—there’s a gentleman here today by the name of Jay Silvers that I’m asking to stand—Jay Silvers and his team were responsible for giving us the fourth highest rating in the nation for the placement of veterans into the job market to find employment.
South Dakota’s the fifth safest State in the Union when it comes to the protection of individuals and people living safely in the communities and state where they live.
"Now, I’d like to name some individuals that’ve won individual awards."
"Judy Payne, who’s the Risk Manager for the state, was selected by the National Association in the past year as the Outstanding Public Entity Risk Manager of the Year."
Let me ask you to hold your applause only because you’d be applauding a lot for these individuals.
Kim McIntosh was the 1997 EPA Regional Environmental Excellence Award winner from the Environmental Protection Agency in Denver.
"Bob Hatten from the Game, Fish and Parks Department was inducted into the Fisheries Management Hall of Fame, and Bill Shattuck has been selected as the National Hunter Education Coordinator of the Year, again, Bill being in the Department of Game, Fish and Parks."
Brenda Tibbets has been selected for the Outstanding Service Award from the Social Security Administration in terms of the work that she does here in South Dakota.
Dave Miller won the National Leadership Award for the leadership that he’s given in employment of the blind and employment of individuals with disabilities.
Linda Bahr has been selected as the Outstanding Health Care Financing Surveyor of the Year for the nation.
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources was selected by the EPA in Denver to receive the Regional Environmental Excellence Award.
The Petroleum Release Compensation Fund that we have in South Dakota for cleaning up all the old tanks and the spills—Mr.
"Dennis Rounds, that manages that program, received the national award for the Best Financial Achievements for any state fund in the nation."
"In the Human Services Agency, Mr. Bruce Wright’s division received the award for the work, which he and his team did by the Social Security Administration’s Award for Outstanding Performance."
"Public Broadcasting in South Dakota, which has been under the direction of Julie Anderson most of the period of time as the Acting Supervisor for the department, has been nationally recognized this year in a tremendous way."
They were selected as having The Best Web Site Award from C/Net.
"Time Magazine gave them an award for Outstanding Special Programming, and at the national convention that was recently held for Public Broadcasting in the nation, the State of South Dakota’s Public Broadcasting Services—both video and audio—received the most awards of any Public Broadcasting agency in the nation, including an award for being Best in Overall Achievement, another award for being Best in Overall Membership Growth, and another award for being Best in Development, as well as three Central Education Network awards."
"The South Dakota Army and Air National Guard, who’ve always made South Dakotans proud every time they’ve committed themselves to training or been called to National or State Service, received 13 additional awards in the past year that’re called Superior Awards, and they won the 1997 Connelly Award For Excellence."
"In the Tourism Department, the Travel Industry Association gave our Tourism Department the First Place Award for Marketing and Creativity."
"There’s a gentleman here today by the name of Gary Keller who, at the recent National Exposition, for the display which he put together in the recruiting of the film industry to come to South Dakota to make movies, received the Best of Show Award at the National Film Location Exposition."
"Mr. Jim Jenssen is here, he’s the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation, and he and the employees in that department have earned the Award of Excellence from the Federal Highway Administration."
"There’s one other individual that I want to introduce to you, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature and South Dakota."
"This young lady—some of you know her—many of you don’t—truly, truly epitomizes what’s unique about South Dakota."
"Because whether you’re talking about adversity, or you’re talking about growth with adversity, or you’re talking about developing under difficult circumstances, or you’re talking about success and knowing how to deal with it, this young twelve-year-old lady epitomizes all of that."
She recently was selected as Miss Pre-Teen in competition.
The Pre-Teen competition that she entered was not a beauty contest; it dealt with other things that human beings have to have.
It dealt with academic achievement.
They tested and examined one’s volunteer service to their church and to the community.
They checked to see how the young person performed in school and what kind of honors and activities they were involved in.
They examined what kind of personal skills had been developed and what abilities the individual has been able to apply.
They examined general knowledge ability and communicative ability and expressiveness and the overall individual.
"During the competition, this young lady won five additional trophies."
"One of them was a trophy, a medallion, a shoulder sash, and a $1,000 scholarship for winning the Junior Pre-Teen of South Dakota award."
She won the First Place trophy in her age division for selling the most ads.
"She won the First Place trophy in her age division for community service, and she tied for the Fourth Place trophy in the talent competition where she performed a gymnastics routine."
"She’s taken it upon herself as one of her endeavors in the community where she lives, the community of Mission, to go around and erase from public and private buildings and paint over swear words and bad slogans and things of that nature."
She’s a lady who dresses up and as they go around and sing to the elderly people at Christmas time—Christmas Carols—she dresses up as a little elf.
She’s a lady that every one of us are proud tells the story of South Dakota.
"And, I talk about her accomplishments, but there’s one thing that I’m mentioning at the end."
She’s accomplished these things in life even though she was born with one of her legs missing and one of her arms missing.
"I’d like to introduce all of you to Miss Ashlie Story from Mission, South Dakota.Ashlie."
Thank you Ashlie and thank you ladies and gentlemen.She's an inspiration.
She’s an inspiration to all of us.
That spirit that Ashlie has is a spirit that South Dakota showed over the course of the last year as it truly came together as one great big family.
"You know, last year I reported to the Legislature one of the areas where we were going to take major initiative was in the area of immunization of children, immunization of our people."
"This year, we have operating in 96 sites and 50 communities, an immunization program—and, honestly, South Dakota started out pretty far behind the curve compared to a lot of other places in the nation."
"Tragically, it was an outbreak of measles in the central part of the state between the Pierre and the Highmore-Miller area that caused a lot of people to panic this year and it caused emergency spending of over $1.4 million."
"We gave over 86,000 MMR shots—measles, mumps and rubella shots—to individuals who had not been age-appropriately immunized when they were young."
"Davison County, which we picked as one of our target communities to start, in the past year has grown from age-appropriate immunizations from 45 percent to 60 percent."
Pennington County has grown from 64 percent to 70 percent.
"We will really only know the true story of how these efforts are working out in the next couple years, because the time when we really check on whether or not individuals had their age-appropriate shots—up from zero through the age of two—is when they start kindergarten."
"By law, we have to examine whether or not they’ve had their shots in order to attend school."
"But, the program’s moving forward very, very well."
"Over the course of the last year, we have worked very diligently and a lot of you, ladies and gentlemen in this state, have worked very, very hard to try and do something about dealing with the problem, or I should say, the opportunity of providing day care assistance throughout the state."
South Dakota has a tremendously high percentage of the number of men and women in the labor force.
"Given that fact, we have times of the day when, for obvious reasons, or at the night, for obvious reasons, when there’s an inability or a tremendous difficulty for some individuals to find adequate adults to take care of their children."
"We’ve begun pushing very, very hard to try and put the public schools of South Dakota to use in terms of having the ability to utilize them after school hours for children who are of the age where they can attend school, where they can just stay in school until 5:00 or 5:30 when their parent or parents get the opportunity to get off of work."
"Today we have over 15 communities that, in one way or another, are making their school buildings available for after school day care."
"But it’s really my desire that over the course of the next 12 months, all of us together band together to try and convince local school boards, school administrators, and the individuals that administer these institutions that are owned by the public to make them available under the appropriate circumstances for school-age children to be able to be cared for after school hours."
"The need is huge, and of all the efforts that we can make, this is probably one of the easiest, because the capital structure and the facilities are already in place."
It’s just a matter of putting them to additional use for care of children and the nurturing of children.
We’ve started a program to build day care centers in the state.
The first prototype has been built in the state penitentiary by the inmates that are building the houses.
"The first prototype has gone to Parmalee, South Dakota, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation."
"It’s in place, but it’s not yet completed and dedicated, which it will be over the course of the next couple of weeks."
"We’re using it as the prototype to see if this building, which is approximately 50 feet in length, 24 feet in width and able to be moved down the highways of South Dakota to be put into place under the appropriate circumstances—and, we believe, able to be built for approximately $30,000."
"It will provide great opportunities in rural communities of South Dakota to at least put a facility in place for day care facilities especially for the children that are zero to four, before school age."
I’m also pleased to report that 17 new day care facilities have been built in South Dakota in the last year.
"With respect to children and their medical needs, I think, as all you Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature know, we currently cover 100 percent of the children zero to eighteen to 100 percent of the federal poverty level."
"And, as you remember from the Budget Address, we are currently covering the children zero to six at 133 percent of the poverty level."
"Given the federal program that’s available, we have provided the maximum amount of state contribution that gives us the maximum percentage of the federal contribution by recommending to the Legislature that you adopt the additional growth in the program to cover all the kids six to eighteen years of age from 100 to 133 percent of the poverty level."
"And, if this happens it will be the largest increase in the covering of kids in the history of South Dakota."
We’ve embarked on a very vigorous program in this state to train day care workers.
This is something that’s terribly important.
"We have all kinds of names for them, whether we’re politically correct or politically incorrect, we have a different vernacular for it, but the bottom line really is, it’s those individuals in the adult community who care for children."
Not everybody understands what it takes.
"A tremendous number of people do in this state, fortunately, but not everybody understands how you care for children at different ages, especially the very, very young and how they grow."
The Bush Foundation has given us a grant which currently at the present time is in the process of training 100 child care workers throughout the state to be trainers to train other people throughout South Dakota in being day care workers.
"We now have 14 programs going in high schools, in 14 different high schools of the state, to assist high school students in taking the courses on how to do day care work."
"We now require, under our state welfare requirements, that every student that’s of school age must go to school or the parent or parents will not receive their welfare checks."
No longer is a person allowed to receive public assistance in South Dakota and not have their children sent to school.
It’s one of the primary requirements of receiving your public assistance check.
I put up on the board one of the charts that deals with child support enforcement.
"I’m pleased to report to you, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature, that over the past year we’ve increased to thirteen thousand three hundred and some individuals who the state is now involved with on a monthly basis in seeing to it that they pay for the children as a mother or a father."
They pay for the children that they help bring into this world.
"As a matter of fact, under the new TANF program where employers submit the documentation to the state when they have new hire—over the past three months we’ve identified over 1,200 parents that we were looking for to make them be required to start making their payments."
"And, I’m pleased to report to the Legislature that, although in some areas there are problems, we have had great cooperation in setting up and starting to administer programs with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Flandreau Santee, and, after a recent meeting that I’ve had with the new tribal chairman and council down there with folks from my administration, we’ll be moving forward over the next couple weeks to adopt the program on the Yankton reservation as well."
"This is tremendously important in that Native Americans who live on the reservation or go to a reservation are outside the legal jurisdiction of the State of South Dakota, but they may have legal and family responsibilities inside the jurisdiction of South Dakota."
The next chart that we have is a chart that shows that the child support collections that have been made through the Department of Social Services over the course of the last year.
"We’ve now grown to $35.5 million that were involved in collecting payments on behalf of children, and these are the kind of payments that historically the taxpayers would have had to have been making instead of the mother and, or, father or both of them that had the legal responsibility to support their children, and the state had the responsibility only if they had an inability to, not because they didn’t feel like doing it."
We have moved forward with a new program in Intensive Family Services.We call it the IFS program.
The reason I mention it today is because we are asking you to budget an additional 16 FTEs to deal with this particular program.
"Really, this is one of the more exciting programs we have been involved in."
"Originally every individual that goes to the state’s boot camp within seven days of the time they go to Boot Camp, a Department of Social Services worker goes to their home and with the family’s permission accesses the family, trying to help answer the questions—What’s the problem?"
Is there anything the family has done or is not doing to contribute to the delinquency or the criminal activity of the child?
"Is there something that deals with alcohol or drugs, or something that deals with education or employment or a whole host of problems that a family can have when it is under stress or domestic violence?"
"Is there something that is wrong or a combination of things, and if there is, is there a way to fix it while the young person is away at the Boot Camp?"
That program has proved so successful so quickly that we’re now in the process of expanding it to all the minors that come into the state’s jurisdiction as a result of a court order placing them in an out-of-home placement.
The new FTEs that we’ve requested for next year will be the individuals that will deal with all of those juveniles that are placed into an out-of-home custody situation.
We’ve started a new program as a pilot project; it’s a Social Worker in the School Program.
"These are individuals that work for the state but are actually placed into a school building and work out of a particular school, not the school system in a town, but a school building to deal with young people who are having troubles of a social nature."
"Originally, we started out a pilot project of three."
"I received a letter from the school Superintendent, the school Principal in the community, and at the particular school where this program was operating—at a meeting that I had out of town I asked for those folks to meet with me so I could talk to them about it."
"They weren’t able to, but I met with two ladies that were classroom teachers, one a second grade teacher and one a sixth grade teacher."
They told me this was one of the most exciting programs that they’ve ever seen to really assist in helping children that go to school.
"And, they relayed to me the example of a young lady who was twelve years old who heretofore had been an average student, with average growth and problems who they could see just in the first couple months of this school year was basically going down hill everyday."
They got the social worker in the school to talk to the young lady.
The social worker went and met with the young lady’s mother.
The young girl came from a home where she had a single parent.
Her mother was a couple of months pregnant.
There was a young two-year-old brother in the household and then this twelve-year-old girl.
"For all practical purposes, this twelve-year-old girl had become the head of the household."
"She cleaned the house, she made the meals, she was taking care and raising her two-year-old brother."
It was more than any twelve-year-old under her circumstances could handle.
"With the intervention of state assistance and community assistance and the mother’s willingness to have somebody work with the family, the school officials told me that just in a few short weeks they could see every day this young twelve-year-old coming back up to being just a normal twelve-year-old child within the school system."
"That program has been now expanded to five school systems, and over the course of the next year, we will be expanding it to a greater extent."
We’ve got the social worker program.
"That program is operating in Watertown, Batesland, Mitchell, Sturgis and Rapid City, and next year we propose to add three school systems over the course of the year to see how it goes."
"And, in the event it continues to be as successful as it is, we will be back, or some other Governor will be back, to the Legislature to be asking them for more positions because this is a program that works."
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and children.
Of all the things that we talk about—Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect—this is something that God doesn't do to children.
It’s something mothers do to children.
It’s one of the few things where you can have a problem in the family—the father can't do it—and it comes from the ingestion of alcohol while someone is carrying a child.
South Dakota is significantly higher than the national average.
"As a matter of fact, the national average are two Fetal Alcohol Syndrome children for every 1,000 births."
"We have a county in South Dakota that has 40 Fetal Alcohol Syndrome births per 1,000.That’s 4 percent.That’s phenomenal."
That’s 20 times the national average.
"For every Fetal Alcohol Syndrome child that is born, statistically there are 10 Fetal Alcohol Effect children that are born."
None of us as adults have the right to abuse a child before they’re born so that when they’re born they spend the only life they ever get with these kinds of maladies or infirmities that are 100 percent preventable.
"We must, every tribal government in this state must, the federal Indian Health Service must, the U. S. Department of Justice must, our justice system must, all of us have got to come up with some methodology to start to address and deal with this."
It is estimated nationally that the average child born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome costs the taxpayers $1.5 million in special education costs and criminal justice costs and medical costs and all kinds of expenses that taxpayers have to expend to provide services and assistance or confinement to these individuals over the course of their life.
"If the number $1.5 million is true, over a lifetime that means the State of South Dakota, through all its agencies and local governments and charities, have spent $80 million over the last four years taking care of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome children."
I dwell on it today because it’s so incredibly important that we no longer make excuses and that we really search to try and find a way to educate and do whatever else is necessary to prevent this preventable problem from happening.
Everybody nowadays thinks it’s in vogue to talk about parenting.
The reality of the situation is that we have second- and even third-generation families in South Dakota that don’t have a clue what parenting is all about.
Most of all of us learn about parenting from our parents or our grandparents.
"And as the chain continues to lengthen between the time when there has been adequate parenting and the generations where there hasn't been, all of a sudden it becomes structured and cultural within our family unit to have an inability to parent."
"I just wish that everybody in South Dakota had the opportunity that Bill Janklow had to go to some of these meetings and go to some of these conferences and meet some of the people that I’ve had a chance to meet when it comes to what medical science, neuroscience is capable of understanding today about a child's mind and the development of a child."
"I was dumbfounded to know, as a matter of fact, last night at dinner; I asked Dr. Scott Eccarius, the Legislator, if it was accurate."
"If a child is born with cataracts and they’re not removed by the age of two, if you remove them at the age of two they will be blind for life, because the brain’s development of vision only takes place during the first 24 months of our life."
"After that point in time, it’s too late, notwithstanding the fact there would be no medical problem wrong with the child; they would be blind for life."
"If you take a child and teach them a foreign language before the age of ten, for their lifetime they will have the ability to speak the language as a native, without an accent."
"So, one thing we know is that Henry Kissinger learned English after the age of ten."
"Something, again, that dumbfounds me."
"Children from birth through the age of four that listen to Mozart and other classical music on a regular basis exercise the same neurons that are used in the brain to develop cognitive math skills, and on average in a lifetime score 20 to 30 percent higher for life than the normal in their ability to deal with mathematics."
"And, now they’ve recently discovered that young children zero to four that are exposed regularly to hard rock perform 20 to 30 percent less in their ability to do mathematics as they continue to grow throughout their life."
Prolonged exposure of a child to stress has a material effect on the physiological development of a child's brain.
Every one of us as human beings are born with 100 billion brain cells.
"And, absent some unique circumstances, that is enough for all of us to learn just about anything we ever want to learn in life."
"At a recent meeting that I was at in Ohio that Lieutenant Governor Hillard and Deb Bowman and Loila Hunking, who is heading up the child care effort for us in the state, attended—this was not a kooky conference, Ladies and Gentlemen, these were substantive people—one of the noon luncheon speakers said that reading to a child even at the age of six months is so important."
"He considered it to be one of the most important things you can do, is to just sit and read for 30 minutes a day.Do they understand you?No."
But are the words that you are using and the process that you are using stimulating that child’s brain in such a way that it contributes to that child’s ability to deal with oral and literary communication throughout their life in an enhanced way?The answer is yes.
"I have asked Public Broadcasting to find the finest series in the nation—or create it—on early childhood development, brain development, zero to two, zero to four, so that all of us can have our learning enhanced on what they used to call the maternal instinct that mothers have, that still is a maternal instinct that mothers and grandmothers have."
"For those of us that don’t have a maternal instinct, that we can become wiser and more knowledgeable so we, as a society, can really turn-to in the effort to make sure that we never do anything to inhibit the growth or detrimental to the growth of our young children."
"When we find the correct series or we put the correct series or find the right people to be on the shows, we are going to broadcast it through our public television networks to all the people of South Dakota, probably repeating it a few times as we do it."
We are putting together parenting classes over a portion of the next couple of months.
"And for some people who receive public assistance through the TANF, or the old ADC program, we are going to require—where necessary—as part of their work requirement that they must attend these parenting classes if they are available."
"We’re going to be approaching the South Dakota Unified Judicial System and ask them if they would assist in a program that, when any person in South Dakota is sentenced for child abuse or child neglect, that they be required as part of their sentence to attend parenting classes to learn more about, not only the opportunity, but the obligations imposed on us as adults to be parents."
We’re going to be implementing—over the next couple months—a new program that’s truly unique in the nation.
"We’re going to require that every inmate sentenced to the South Dakota State Penitentiary—be they male or female—and every young person, teenager, that’s turned over to our custody for an out-of-home placement by the court system—whether they be at Plankinton or they be at Custer or they be at the Lamont Center—wherever they may be—or the Boot Camp—that they be required to have, as part of their other instruction, parenting classes on, again, the opportunity and the responsibility of being a parent for young children."
I’m pleased to report today that we have 513 foster care homes in South Dakota.
That’s the most that we’ve had in the past 10 years.
"We’ve made a tremendous effort by reaching out to service clubs and the religious community and their leadership and citizens throughout the state because, I’m telling you my friends, we have a terrible, terrible need for foster homes."
"We take children into the state’s custody, many of them through what I’ll call the criminal process."
"We can send them to Boot Camp, or we can send them to Lamont or Plankinton and a lot of them we can truly straighten out."
"But, sending them back home to the same mess and garbage they came from will turn them back very quickly into what it was that they were when they left."
We have to find families and homes for these children.
"So, all I can do is to continue to plead and ask because it’s not a mercenary thing—nobody makes any money at it, although we will pay the subsistence—but the state, the people, the kids of South Dakota, desperately, desperately need to have more foster care homes available."
We have a crying need for the young Native Americans that we have within the custody of the state to have families to live with.
We got a group home functioning thanks to you Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature a few years ago at Custer in the old Developmental Center.
"We currently have 52 individuals living in that living center and, unfortunately, it’s not a home.We give them good meals."
We give them good medical care.
"We provide a good education for them, or good educational opportunity."
"We provide good clothing and a good, safe, roof over their head, and all the things that you have to have of a physical nature, we take care of."
"But, we can’t be a mother to them and we can’t be a father to them, and as hard as we try, the state can’t exhibit emotion and love to kids."
"As an alternative, we’re going to continue to expand our group home activities, but the primary thing we’d like to do is have children living at home with their parent or parents."
"We’d like to have them living with relatives if they can’t live with a parent or parents, and we desperately need foster homes for children."
"And, so, really I’m including it in my speech today even though it doesn’t call for legislation, because I’m well aware a lot of people in South Dakota are listening and I’m calling on the people of this state to please really examine within your family unit on whether or not you’d be willing to work on taking a child that needs a foster home."
"In terms of technology and education, I’d like to once again report to the Legislature where we’re at in terms of wiring the schools."
"If they’re up there on that chart in red, wherever you see any of them in red, we currently have inmates wiring those schools."
"If they’re on there in blue, those have already been wired by the inmates."
"And, what you see there are not county or any other kind of boundaries, those are the school district boundaries for South Dakota."
"If you see them up there in green, they’re a school district that has embarked upon it themselves to wire their schools without waiting for the inmates to do it, and we’ve offered free materials to any school district, whether it’s the CAT 5 Cable, the R59 Cable, the Fiber Optic conduit or cable—or a combination of it because the schools we do, we’re doing all three—or the electrical receptacles and electrical wiring where we are having to upgrade every school—even the new ones—that we go into to make them conducive to handling the electricity that the new computer technology will bring in the classroom."
The green ones represent anywhere from 5 percent to 100 percent of completion by a school district that’s done it on their own.
We now have impacted 82 of the 176 school districts in South Dakota.
"Almost exactly half of them, and we have completed through the green and the blue colors, 64,000 of the 135,000 students that we have in the state."
We’re really working hard to try and get all the schools wired by within approximately a year to a year and a month from today.
"We’re going to be approaching the Legislature over the next week or so to ask them to please approve of us making the necessary transfers from one-time funds that are available to continue the wiring program which is truly one of the more exciting things that we’ve embarked upon in the state, for an opportunity for children to have the ability to enhance—not to learn—but to enhance their learning process in their K-12 education."
I’ve had an opportunity to sit down and meet with the presidents of all six of our universities to talk about technology within the university setting and training the teachers who will be coming out of school to be the new private and public classroom teachers of South Dakota.
I’ve had a breakfast meeting at my house that lasted for several hours with the education deans at all the universities that have a college of education for educating educators.
I’m happy to say that every one of them has accepted the task and has agreed to move forward on a very aggressive basis so that we can get the faculty trained so they can train the students that’ll be graduating so we don’t just have to continuously try and train the teachers after they’re out of school on how they can put effective technology to use to enhance the learning process for kids.
"When you look at this next chart that I’m putting up, you can see that in a recent publication, Changing Education, they listed the various aspects of technology programs for a full, rounded technology program for schools."
"What’s phenomenal about it, is, without having had the benefit of that chart, or talking to those people, this is exactly the course that we’ve embarked on in South Dakota.We are wiring the schools."
"We had the summer program last summer where, at Dakota State University—which I explained to you ladies and gentlemen in the Budget Message—we trained 143 classroom teachers from the K-12 school districts in the state where, this next summer, in two sessions at Dakota State and two sessions at Black Hills State University, we will train 660 classroom teachers."
"Over the course of the next three years, we will train 2,200 classroom teachers in the utilization of technology in the K-12 system."
"With respect to the Internet and the wide-area networks, we’ve worked very aggressively to try and get that set up and structured for our school systems."
"Frankly, it’s very, very complicated because we have US West in 35 communities, we have municipal telephone companies in a few communities, we have privately-owned telephone companies owned by families or individuals in a few communities, and we have many rural telephone co-ops."
"We’re as balkanized as you can be in the telecommunications world, and yet the necessity and the requirements for having these kinds of resources available at every school—it doesn’t make any difference whether it’s a small school like Agar or a huge school system like the Sioux Falls school system—every school system has to be on a level playing field if all the children of South Dakota are going to have the ability to benefit from this explosion in technology that’s taking place."
"I can report to you, in the recently-completed negotiations, we’ve signed a contract with US West where, in the territories where US West is located with state institutions, the deal we made for local service not only brought about a reduction in expenses for our monthly services every month—a substantial reduction—but includes ISDN at 128 K for the state government to be on ISDN on our phone lines through utilizing frame relay and other types of advanced technology and every school system in the territory where we have state offices on their system."
"They’re part of the deal that I made on behalf of state government, which is the largest purchaser of local service of any business in South Dakota."
"I can also report to you that SDN, South Dakota Network, which is basically owned by the cooperatives in the state, and US West are, in a collaborative way—one of the few areas where they’re cooperating—are putting together a proposal where they can offer ISDN services, frame relay services, in some instances T1 services, which are 10 times the capability of an ISDN line, offering those services to every single school in the State of South Dakota at a very, very favorable rate, which will bring about an explosion in opportunity for our students and their faculty."
"Right now, Dakota State University just started a course in local area networks."
I just agreed a week ago for the Governor’s Office to partially subsidize the course.
"It’s being taught on the RDTN Network, and it’s the first formal course that we’re starting to offer state-wide in network administration, because every school building that’s wired will be a network, a local area network bleeding into a wide area network, which will deal with the Internet and other methodology to get back and forth between the various locations in South Dakota, and we need the administration."
The school-to-home connection’s a no-brainer.
"Once the school’s wired up, once the school has a server and a modem, if you’ve got a computer at home and a modem, you’re into the school."
"Then your access is only limited by what the school wants to make available, but it opens up tremendous opportunities for parents to really get tuned in on an ongoing basis of what’s going into the school system."
The tech support ties into the local area network.
"The hardware and software support, the BIT of state government, Harris Haupt, and the folks from TIE, which are part of the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative working on contract with the school systems in South Dakota—are all working together as a consortium to come up with recommended—not mandatory—but recommended standards that we can apply statewide in South Dakota as we move forward in getting all these schools tied into the modern technology that’s available for enhancing learning."
"My friends, I’m going to tell you one of the reasons this is so exciting."
"Every time you go to a meeting outside of South Dakota everybody tells you how they’re number one, but I can tell you without any equivocation, there is no State in the Union that is wiring its schools with the technology and with the dispersion—three out of every four students—that we’re doing in South Dakota."
"When we’re completed with this project, a little over a year from today, we will have the most advanced public school wired-up system on the planet earth for public school systems."
"And, most of the rest of the states will never get to where we’re at, because they’re doing it differently involving substantially less growth and expansion and dispersion of those types of things."
I’d like to show you some examples of standards in education.
"This is probably one area where it generates a lot of controversy, but it’s something we need to meet head on and talk about and have a policy decision for this state."
"And, some people believe we shouldn’t have any standards and some people believe we should not only have standards, but they ought to be mandatory in their application on local school systems."
"And, wherever you stand on one extreme or the other, we need some uniform basis to determine, What is it that children should know when they leave the first grade and the second grade and the third grade and the twelfth grade?"
Can our kids compete on a world-class level?
"That’s what we really talk about, and, frankly, that isn’t even what’s important in the final analysis."
"Let me show you Virginia’s, and I realize it’s a little hard to read, and I realize it’s somewhat parochial, but Virginia, for grade eleven, standard 11.3."
"With respect to the Revolutionary War period, they say that, one of the things they want the students to know when they get out of the course is the ""changes in the British policies that provoked the Colonialists."
"The debate within America concerning separation from Britain; the Declaration of Independence,"" and the treatise Common Sense."
"Individuals, including Virginians, because it’s parochial, who provided leadership in the Revolution—key battles, military turning points, key strategic decisions—I think we would all agree that if students knew that about the Revolutionary War period, they’d have a real basic understanding of the Revolutionary War period.Let me show you California’s."
"Now, just because a state passed a standard doesn’t mean they teach them."
"But, let’s look at California’s—and I’m not going to go through and read them all—but, just take the first one, ""Describe major events and explain ideas leading to the war for independence."
"Analyze key phrases,"" and, by the way, this is the eighth grade."
"This isn’t high school, this is the eighth grade—""Analyze key phrases of the Declaration of Independence and explain how they justified revolution with special emphasis on the natural rights philosophy and the concept of ‘the consent of the governed,’ etc."
"Again, very specific, each and every one of these."
"Now, let me show you South Dakota’s current standard."
"""Standard number six, The Benchmark."
This is for nine to the twelfth grade.
"""Nine to twelve students will""—and let me read this sentence—""reconstruct temporal structure of historical narrative or story based on identifying connections between events."
Is there a human being that understands that gobbledy-gook?
Talk about gobbledy-gook and something that’s embarrassing for this state.
You tell me that any kid nine to twelve will have any understanding what they’re supposed to learn about the Revolutionary War period.Let me take the next one.
"""Analyze and explain multiple complex causation relationships through chronological organization.You can all do that can’t you?"
"After all, it’s only nine to twelve."
"This is embarrassing, Ladies and Gentlemen, for South Dakota."
"This makes us like buffoons, and we need to do something about it."
We need to do something quickly.
"Bill Janklow does not care, personally, what the standards are when we’re done, but when we’re done, we need a consensus by the State Board of Education, the Legislature, the local school boards, the parents—of, what is it that we want students to know in each grade, and clearly, what do we want them to know when they get a high school diploma and come out of our institutions with respect to United States history, and math, and science, and the arts, and music, and English, and all of these things that go toward creating the basis for making a well-rounded, educated individual."
"We’re going to be asking the Legislature to approve a transfer to us of $500,000 so we can move forward—although we’re working on it—on a very aggressive basis, to get our standards done."
"When they are done, I can tell you, I will submit them to the State Board of Education for their modification and approval."
"Before we implement them, I will submit them or I will request that whoever the successor Governor is, will submit them to the Legislature for their consideration so we don’t get into these philosophical fights before we get something written that we can all vote on looking for a majority vote."
"But, the point that I’m trying to make is this isn’t where we’re last, this is where we’re an embarrassment to ourselves."
"We’re going to fix it, and we’re going to give ourselves standards that we can truly deal with our students on."
"When we give ourselves standards it’s important because we’ve all learned something in life—when you expect more from students, students learn more and they achieve more."
"Human beings always rise to the level that’s expected of them, or sink to the level that’s expected of them."
Here’s an amazing national poll.
I’m putting it up only because I find it so amazing.
"Seventy-four percent of the teenagers that were polled in a national poll said schools should only pass students to the next grade when they’ve learned what’s expected of them, and seventy-six percent of the teenagers in America say students should not be allowed to graduate from high school unless they have demonstrated a good command of the English language."
"I actually had a young student, three years ago, who was a Mickelson scholar, who wrote me a letter of criticism over that program and had twenty-one grammatical errors in the one-page letter that that student sent me."
"Twenty-one errors in spelling, conjugating of verbs, tenses and Lord knows what."
The next chart that we have tells you how we’re going to deal with the standards.
"They’re going to be clear, measurable, specific, demanding and comprehensive."
They’re going to be clear because the student and the teachers and the parents have to understand them.
They’re going to be specific because they’re going to include enough detail so they’re not abstract or general so that different people can interpret them in different ways.
"They’re going to be measurable because if you can’t measure it, you’ll never know if you’ve achieved it."
"And, they’re going to be comprehensive because they should cover all the area of the subject matter, or all the components of the skill and not just a few selected ones depending upon someone’s bias."
"And, they have to be demanding because they have to require that every student has to have the ability to think to go to the next level of knowledge or skill development and the expectations and the results have to be higher and higher."
I’m pleased to report to you that we have virtually revamped the technical schools in the state.
The Sioux Falls school; Southeast Vo-Tech; Lake Area Vo-Tech in Watertown; Mitchell Area Tech and Western Dakota Technical Institute.
"All four of them are on the way, seriously, to becoming four of the best in the nation, and some of them already are."
I mean they’re truly world-class.
Over the last few years we’ve pumped millions of dollars of new technology into those schools in terms of the equipment and the resources that the students and the faculty need to teach and need to learn.
"At the same time, they’ve significantly upgraded their standards and their programming."
"In addition to that I can report to you that in the fall enrollment, full-time students at the four institutes are up an average of 8 percent for the system and part-time students are up 12 percent."
A couple of years ago I took a lot of criticism for saying that we would not fund the kinds of courses that guarantee low-paying jobs for the students when they graduate.
"If employers want to pay the minimum wage, they can train the workers."
The workers and their parents and their families and those people that contribute in the public toward one’s education should be contributing toward the value-added jobs that we need to have.
"Employers that want to pay the lowest wages at the minimum level, if they want trained workers; they should use their resources to train the workers."
"Frankly, I took a lot of criticism for this, but I honestly believe we were headed on the right track and it was worth the fight."
"Today, the proof is in the results of the new, exciting courses these schools are offering and the exciting opportunity—value-added opportunity—that these students are having as a result of having a quality education."
"I’m going to be approaching the Legislature over the course of the next few weeks—frankly, because all the statistical work, the fiscal work isn’t done, we’re going to recommend—we don’t have to do it—I’m going to recommend to the Legislature that you authorize additional bonding so that expansion can be done at Lake Area Vo-Tech, Southeast Vo-Tech, and Western Dakota Tech—all three of them are to the stage where they absolutely need to grow and they need more space."
"So, I’ll be asking the Legislature—once we get the package put together over the next couple of weeks—I’ve met with individuals in Rapid City, I’ve met with individuals in Sioux Falls—I’ve not yet had the meeting with the folks in Watertown—but, when I’m completed with that we’ll have a package we’ve put together where we will be making recommendations to the Legislature to allow us to do additional bonding to bring about the successful growth of those particular programs.Smart classrooms."
"I used some discretionary money that was available to the Governor last year and I gave $100,000 to each of our six universities with one sole purpose—take one classroom and put $100,000 of the best state-of-the-art equipment to make this what is called a smart classroom—not just using it as a demonstration project on the campus, but use it as a real tool on the campus to deal and hook up with the outside world and have inter-campus activity between the various campuses."
Tomorrow morning that system is going to be dedicated.
"All of the six schools have built their smart classrooms and tomorrow they will be successfully merged together at a ribbon-cutting that will take place tomorrow morning and some of you, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature that may be interested could go down to RDTN to look at the ribbon-cutting or the inaugural of it."
"We’re limited here because our facilities aren’t to the extent these smart classrooms are, but you’ll all get an understanding—those of you who attend it—will get a real understanding of the significance of what those smart classrooms can do to revolutionize, again, the learning process—not learning—but the learning process in our higher education institutions."
"When we came before the Legislature a couple of years ago we had a tremendous problem with juveniles, a growing problem."
We still have a tremendous problem with juveniles.
"But, we’ve been able to make very, very substantial headway against it."
"Two years ago, I came before the Legislature and asked them to allow a capital construction program to build some additional facilities, to change the Custer Development Center, to build a Boot Camp, to build a prison, to move the young girls from Redfield out to Custer."
"At that time, we had resources available for 25 girls in the Lamont Program, 50 boys in the Youth Forestry Camp, and 105 students at Plankinton, and that was it."
"Today, I’m happy to report to you, that we have a capacity for 105—as a matter of fact, we have 105—kids at Plankinton."
"In the new 40-bed prison, which is just being completed, there are 20 hardened, young criminals in that prison."
The Lamont Center for Girls has doubled in size and currently is operating in its two units—the intensive unit and the other unit—with 50 young girls.
The Boot Camp has an ongoing 120 and the program is a four-month program and they rotate in every 30 days.
The first Wednesday of every month they start a new platoon.
There are 120 boys in the Boot Camp.
In the Living Center as of today there are 52 young people that are living in the Living Center.
"And, we’ve got a special unit that we’ve created over the course of the last year at the Redfield State Hospital."
It’s for individuals who have developmental disabilities or other types of disabilities who are criminals or prone to criminal activity—either as a sexual or a physical predator in one way or another.
"Given their mental condition, they are unable to control or deal with themselves and so we’ve started a special unit in the secure location up there in Redfield at the State Hospital, and we currently have, I believe it’s 17 individuals, in that program."
"As far as the Boot Camp is concerned, it’s got three components."
"Early intervention, the integrated activities in the Boot Camp, and the mentoring program."
"I can report to you that when I came before the Legislature a couple of years ago and asked for additional facilities for juveniles, we had 241 juveniles that had been ordered by the courts of South Dakota to an out-of-home placement who were living in a detention center someplace or still at home waiting to get into a state institution because we were so backed up and full.Today, the backlog is zero."
"If a child is ordered by the court system of South Dakota to an out-of-home placement, within 72 hours they’re in one of our state facilities or one of our contract facilities without any delay."
This has made a tremendous difference in the ability to really start working and getting these kids straightened out.
"With respect to the Boot Camp, there’s five parts to their program and all five of them are emphasized equally."
And I realize and I know some of you Legislators and citizens have had a chance to go out there.
"I’d like to find some time maybe this spring where those of you that haven’t had the chance—we’d get you together and go out, because we don’t allow tours on a daily basis because these young people—one, they’re entitled to their privacy—but, two, they are undergoing rigorous programming seven days a week."
They live a very military lifestyle—very military.
They must attend four hours a day of concentrated classroom instruction—all of them.
They receive group and individual counseling in a very concentrated way.They’re taught life skills.
"Every student that’s come out of our Boot Camp is certified as an Emergency Medical Technician, for example, and is skilled in CPR, but they learn life skills."
"For some of them, they’re learning more life skills than that, because they’re so close to being adults and the only thing waiting for them when they get out is a worthless home, or a worthless family, and they’re going to be having to take care of themselves as an adult in a very short period of time."
"And, we have very vigorous physical training."
"I’ve asked two individuals to come here today that, I believe, are up behind me."
"The first one, I’d like to have stand up is Clay Ramsey."
"Clay Ramsey has the responsibility for what I’ll call the penal side of juvenile corrections in the state, and he is the individual, the colonel of the Boot Camp that directed the getting up and running of the Boot Camp proper."
"Clay Ramsey comes from Wall, South Dakota, spent twelve years in the United States Marine Corps, the last three years in the Marine Corps he was the commanding officer at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego of the Drill Instructors Company that has the drill instructors for the Boot Camp."
He made a decision that he wasn’t going to make the Marine Corps his career.He moved back to South Dakota.
He was managing a lumber mill at the time that he applied for and was hired for the position.
"In terms of his competence in dealing with setting up the Boot Camp, he’s done a phenomenal job."
"Also here today, at my request, is a gentleman we call Major Snyder."
Major Snyder is the number two individual at the Boot Camp.
He’s now taken over the directorship of the Boot Camp as Ramsey is now taking over what I’ll call the juvenile penal programs.
Major Snyder will be in charge of the Boot Camp.
Major Snyder spent twenty years in the United States Marine Corps.
He retired as a Gunnery Sergeant.
Both of these gentlemen hold graduate and advanced degrees.
"Major Snyder, in his last twelve years in the Marine Corps, was in Marine Corps reconnaissance, and he was part of one of the groups that entered Kuwait during Desert Storm before the invasion took place to work behind the enemy lines."
Both of these individuals are truly national star performers.
"Some people still have trepidation about whether or not a Boot Camp works, if it’s structured right."
The University of Maryland has recently conducted an analysis of two-and-a-half dozen boot camps around the nation under a contract with the US Justice Department.
"Although the report’s not yet been issued, the letter that I received from the evaluators from the University of Maryland, told me that they—although there’s skepticism on whether or not Boot Camps work—they think South Dakota has the absolute best program that they’ve looked at."
They’re recommending it as a model to other states and other communities that are looking at setting up a Boot Camp.
"In terms of recidivism, and I realize the jury’s still out on this, Ladies and Gentlemen, I understand that."
"But, the average young person that goes to the State Training School at Plankinton for the last several years has spent an average of eight months at Plankinton."
"The recidivist rate is 26 percent—that means for all practical purposes—one out of four is a failure—or, we’ve failed."
"So far in the Boot Camp—and I realize the Boot Camp is only one year old—our recidivist rate is running one out of five instead of one out of four, at 21 percent."
"But, we also recognize that in the first year of Boot Camp we’re picking up a five-year backlog of immense problems in the juvenile justice system where there were juveniles that have been in and out of court many times, a lot of them, many of them have been to Plankinton more than once."
"There was just no place to put them, because the judges couldn’t put them in a penitentiary."
They were too young and too fragile as human beings.
"So, we recognize that we’re going to get a disproportionate share of failures, on the front end of the Boot Camp, but by the same token, we get a disproportionate share of failures, because we’re going to have a disproportionate share of problem kids."
"Now, young people are being sentenced by the courts to out-of-home placement far faster than they were before, because thanks to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, and the support of the people of South Dakota, we have the facilities available to deal with them in a cost-effective, reasonable way."
"The last statistic I want to give you, which I think is incredibly important, although the failure rate is one out of five at Plankinton, and one out of four at the Boot Camp, the program at the Boot Camp is half as long as Plankinton, so for half the time and the investment, we’re now getting a better result than we were with just Plankinton.We’ve started a new program."
"Actually, this program came to me as a result of Judge Patrick McKeever out of the judicial circuit here in Pierre."
"He wrote me a letter telling me about an experimental program that he tried within his circuit, I then sat down and had a meeting with him, with some of my staff and he explained his enthusiasm for the program after having had some of our people at Human Services and the Chemical Dependency program review it."
"Honestly, no matter how you looked at it, it was something I thought we should give an attempt to try."
The net result is that I’ve used some of the Byrne money—Edward Byrne money—available to me on federal grant funds to fund the program in the judicial system.
We’ve offered it to every circuit court presiding judge to put in their circuit at their discretion.
I believe I’m accurate when I say it’s been implemented by all the presiding judges.
It’s available in all the circuits.
"But, it was something we made available to all of them."
"I can report to you that based on the statistics at present, in the six-hour primary program—and these are for kids that basically have indicated some problems and it’s been brought before the court system, for chemical or alcohol violations or dependency."
"We’ve had 1,800 that have gone through what’s called the Six-Hour Primary Program."
"Some of them don’t go through the primary program, and some who fail the six-hour program are then required—as an alternative to being formally pushed through the criminal justice system as a juvenile—to take the 36-hour Intensive Program."
"The 36-hour Intensive Program has handled 421 kids, or approximately 17 percent, and this, if it’s going to be done, the parent or parents have to agree to be an integral part of the program with the children."
One hundred and one have been referred to some type of outpatient treatment for chemical or alcohol problems—97 of them have gone to in-patient treatment as a result of the 36-hour program moving forward.
"But, Ladies and Gentlemen, the cost per child at this point in time has been $112 per child that’s been in the program."
"Referred to the next level of service has been $200 and so far, of the 2,054 children, or young people, or teenagers that have been through this program, it appears at this point we have a recidivist rate of only 129 kids."
"If this program continues to work like it looks like it is, it’s one of the best investments that any of us have been able to make in straightening out kids in a long period of time."
"The next chart that we have, let’s take a look at adults and crimes for moment."
"Starting in 1992, the arrest of adults—misdemeanors and felonies—actually 1991 peaked and has been dropping at a steady rate of a little better than 1,000 or more every year since then."
"Where, although we had 31,000 adult arrests in 1991, we now have 25,000 plus adult arrests for misdemeanors and felonies, at a time when our penitentiary population continues to grow and grow and grow."
"Before I became governor this time, the Legislature commissioned a study which came back which indicated that we would have a certain population by, I believe, the year 2002."
We exceeded that number my first year and a half in office this time.
There is no human being that can ever come in and take our money and waste it telling us what the prison population’s going to be in the future.
"They don’t know any more about it than we do, and we don’t know any more about it than they do."
"Our population is going to be whatever it takes to protect the public in their persons and their property because the will of the people of South Dakota is when people become dangerous to other people or other people’s property, they want them locked up until they are no longer dangerous to other people or other people's property."
"At the same time we see the precipitous drop in arrests by adults we have continued to grow at an ever-increasing rate, again about 500."
We’ve continued to grow in the number of arrests of juveniles since 1996.
The next chart really puts this in a different perspective.
"Even though the number of arrests of juveniles are steady or slightly or continuing to grow, the number of juveniles in 1997 that had petitions filed against them by state’s attorneys went down 3,000 or approximately 40 percent, an immense drop in the number of petitions that were filed in the last year."
"You can see by the yellow bars that the number committed by the court system to an out-of-home placement has stayed relatively constant ’93, ’94, ’95, ’96 and ’97."
It’s been relatively constant except for the last year where it actually went down approximately 100.
"So what you see is, even though the number of arrests are going up from the previous chart, the number of juvenile petitions is dropping substantially."
Now part of that is that diversion program that we were just talking about a couple of minutes ago.
"The next chart also tells us, we believe, an indication of why that’s happening."
"If you look at Active After Care for Juvenile Cases ’92, ’93, ’94, ’95 and ’96, you see a number that the highest it was was in June 30 in ’95 at 126, and the low of June 30 of ’96 at 43."
"But the last two years, we’ve jumped up to 408 through June 30 of last year."
"As of December 31, a week or so ago, we’re at 472 juveniles."
"Now, these are juveniles that are in the system, but out."
They’re not locked up in any state institution or private institution.
"And we’ve got a leash on them in after care, and some of them have a real short leash, and some of them have a long leash."
But they all have a leash on them.
"So what I believe we’re beginning to see is the amount of effort we put into after care, the amount of effort we put into sensible diversion, the amount that we work with the families like that 36-hour program that Judge McKeever and his people came up with that requires not just the kids but the families to get involved, is starting to show a direct impact on the number of juvenile petitions being filed."
"The programs, it looks like, at this point in time, all together are really, really working very, very well."
"If you look at the next chart, it’s got my theme on it—""More active aftercare cases for juvenile causes fewer petitions to commit juvenile crime."
"Building homes within the correctional system—as you all know, we have a home building program."
"The next chart, I’m putting it up just to show the impact of the success of that program so far."
Every place that’s a star is a community where one or more homes have been placed.
"Of the 168 homes that have been built by the inmates, 135 to 138 of which have now been delivered to some community in South Dakota."
"You can go up to a community like Britton where they bought two of them, moved them close to each other, put them on a lot, and the community built the garage between them—so they both share a garage, and they have elderly people living in them, to all kinds of creative things that are being done."
"But it’s the hottest deal in America, $20,000 a building delivered any place in South Dakota to a person who is handicapped, disabled, or over the age of 62 in a community of less than 5,000."
"What you see in the three red dots, the three red circles, are where we have delivered two of the actual homes that have been purchased to be used as day care centers within a community."
I did attend a dedication in Mellette where the community up there bought one and turned it into a senior citizens’ center.
I was there the day they dedicated it.
It was just marvelous the way they turned that into a lovely little senior citizens’ center for the community of Mellette.
And the last red dot you see down here in Todd County is where our new pilot one is that’s 50 feet long and 24 feet wide that’s our prototype of a real day care center built to day care specifications that we are going to see how that program works.
How are inmates doing in working?
I report to the Legislature every chance I get.
"I can report to you that over the course of the last year, the inmates of South Dakota worked over 800,000 hours outside the prison walls doing everything from wiring the schools to—we now have, we had one, we then had two—now we have three crews where we’ve hired roofers or retired roofers to teach inmates how to put roofs on buildings so we can go around and really materially attack this immense problem we have of the roofs for state buildings."
"So, we’ve got inmates learning the roofing trade."
I can report to you also that one-half of all the inmates that have been involved in the wiring project that are out of prison are now employed in the wiring industry in a meaningful occupation.
"As you know, they tuck-pointed the state Capitol saving $3 million a couple of years ago."
"They’ve tuck-pointed the School for the Deaf in Sioux Falls, the Old Soldiers Home in Hot Springs."
They’ve worked on the college campuses.
"We’re having them move around wherever there are state buildings tuck-pointing the buildings, and they’ve been involved in all kinds of community activities that you can imagine from hauling sand bags to helping people move their stuff out of the way of floods to moving things back into people’s houses after the floods."
"I can report that the inmates have done a phenomenal job and the leadership in the correctional system has done a phenomenal job in fulfilling the philosophy that this administration has, that there’s dignity in work and everybody that works for a living has a far better chance of going straight, being straight, and staying straight than those that don’t work."
We’ve implemented new fiscal reforms in the prison system.
"Today, every inmate that receives, whether it’s their $2-a-day wage within the system or they work on work release for a private employer out in the community and come back in the prison in the evening."
"Every inmate, based on a formula, is required to take their money and first pay towards their child support for their children, restitution for the criminal activity they did that injured other people, pay their fines and the court costs that have been awarded against them."
"So, they are learning to pay on their bills no matter how little or how much that they make."
"At the same time, we instituted a new policy a couple of months ago where an inmate that initiates a medical visit has to pay $2 for the visit."
"Now, if they can’t afford it and don’t have the money, they’ll be able to have the visit anyhow, and then they will have to pay it back later.But, they must pay $2 a visit."
"If there’s a medical reason to continue treatment or to do treatment, they don’t pay any more for the remainder of the treatment."
"In the first three months of that program, visitation for sick call has dropped 28 percent per month in the prison system, saving a very substantial sum of money given what medical costs cost today."
"The South Dakota Highway Patrol, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is one that I just have to talk about every year."
"It’s something that only Bill Janklow really cares about, but as long as I am in public life I am going to beat it to death, because whether I have been a defense lawyer or a prosecutor throughout my life, my legal life, I’ve seen nothing but the impact drugs are having on our kids."
"I guess I didn’t grow up in the ’60s and ’70s, so I can’t say we all smoked a little dope, we turned out all right.I didn’t understand it.It didn’t happen to us."
We grew up in the aspirin and Coke era is when we grew up and that was a long time ago.
"But, over the course of the last year, and the aggressive program—and these statistics are just from the South Dakota Highway Patrol’s 155 men and women that are out patrolling the roads."
"In the last year, our number of DWI arrests actually went down approximately 400.They went down 8 percent."
"But, the number of drug arrests just by the South Dakota Highway Patrol went up 24 percent over the course of the last year."
"Last year, we recorded almost 2,500 drug arrests."
"And, everybody talks about getting the users or the pushers."
"Maybe it’s just time we started looking at how we get the users, because if you didn’t have users you wouldn’t have pushers."
Drugs are not a highly profitable trade in South Dakota.
"They’re so available, they’re cheap."
There’s no supply and demand equation problem.
"The fundamental law of economics works very, very well with drugs."
There’s a lot of them so they’re cheap.
"And the cost that we pay in diversion programs, in treatment programs, in in-patient programs at the Yankton State Hospital and the other private nonprofit institutes around the state, at the Custer Unit where we’ve had a chemical dependency program operating, the cost that we have in terms to our criminal justice systems in investigations and prosecutions and taking them before the court system—the costs that we have in incarceration are astronomical and we’re losing the battle more every year."
"This is the greatest political issue of all, because the real people in South Dakota are sick of drugs."
I realize some politicians aren’t.
I realize some people who write letters to the editor aren’t.
"But, I also know the real people are sick of it.That’s the silent majority."
"And, I can tell you the students hate it!"
"The students despise the druggers in their peer group, but they’re afraid and can’t do anything about it."
"And, deterrent works because we started going into the school system with those drug dogs a year ago."
"The second school we went into, the fourth, fifth and sixth schools we went into we found drugs in the schools."
"Then we got into an argument on how we were going to deal with it—not when they marked somebody, but when they found the drugs."
"I said that since the Highway Patrol worked for the Governor, you will remove them from the building in chains in front of their classmates."
You will take them into arrest as a Felony arrest.
You will remove them from the building in front of their classmates.
I want all the other students to see and know what happens when someone is found with drugs on them in a school building.
"Miraculously, this year we’ve only had one school search since September where they found drugs."
"I don’t know what the reason is, but I can tell you we have only had one where they found drugs this year."
"But, I’m asking you Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature to take serious consideration on dealing in a very, very material way, in how we are going to address and deal with this drug question."
"And, it isn’t good enough, frankly, to continue to make excuses for people that are involved in the criminal aspects of dealing with drugs."
We’ve started another unique program in conjunction with the Catholic Diocese in Sioux Falls.
"Actually, it was a grant that they put in for that we supported them on."
"It’s a program that’s called ""Project Alert."
It is the most successful program in the nation based on evaluations and analysis for dealing with children in the grades one through seven to stay away from drugs and alcohol.
The RAND Corporation is the one that basically invented and put together and nurtured this program.
"It’s got the highest documented, as I said, the highest documented success rate in the nation."
We’re the first State in the Union to move it into our high schools.
"And, through the Catholic Diocese, some of their schools east of the river, as well as some of the public schools in South Dakota, we’re sharing a funding program and we’re sharing the individuals from the RAND Corporation and from the South Dakota community to bring it to some of our high schools in the state to see how the program works."
We are the pilot project for the rest of America and that program is something that has just gotten up and running and some Governor will be able to report to the Legislature next year on the success or the failure of that particular program.
I can’t resist showing all of you citizens this next comment.
It looks like it was probably written with the precision that Bill Janklow writes.
"In a recent news story the statement was written ""Despite,"" and think through this, ""Despite a rise in inmates, statistics show that serious crimes are on the wane in South Dakota."
"Had I had the opportunity to be the editor of that story, I would have changed one word, ""Because"" of the rise in inmates in South Dakota, serious crimes are on the wane."
"We’re having an impact, Ladies and Gentlemen, in terms of these programs that you’ve supported and that all of us have moved forward with."
"Last year it was quite a struggle, but we were finally able to convince you Ladies and Gentlemen, or at least a majority of you in the Legislature, to do something about the speed enforcement in construction zones where we had a nice history of just killing and injuring people because nobody would slow down, or very few would."
"I can report to you that since this new program went into effect July 1, we say fatalities are down 100 percent because we had none this year."
"In addition to that, injury—and, by the way, we had the largest construction operations and budget in the history of South Dakota this past summer."
"So, although we have far more construction than we had before, not only fortunately did we have no fatalities, but injuries were down 37 percent in the construction zone by motorists."
"Speed related accidents were down 28 percent and $186,000 worth of fines were turned over to the school systems of the state by people who paid fines for their violations."
"If I can for a moment, I would like to talk about the world of the environment."
"Over the course of the past year, 49 formal administrative actions have been filed dealing with environmental problems for wastewater, drinking water or solid waste."
"And, those are formal actions on the administrative side."
"Penalties were assessed to the tune of about $289-$290,000."
"At DENR’s request, the Attorney General’s office just filed eight different pieces of litigation against people we believe were malefactors with respect to coming to the environment."
"You, Ladies and Gentlemen—during the course of this session—in South Dakota this fall when it votes are going to be dealing with issues that involve the occupation of raising livestock."
"If I could, I would like to explain myself abundantly clear to everybody where Bill Janklow and his administration stand."
"We’re for the family farmer, period, paragraph!"
A family farmer ought to have the God-given freedom to make their living any way they can make the most money!
Any way that they can make the most money.
"And, it doesn’t make any difference whether someone feeds their hogs, my hogs, that table’s hogs or the banker’s hogs at 10 percent."
They ought to have the ability to raise cattle and hogs and anything of a nature of livestock the way that makes them the most money.That’s their business.
What’s Bill Janklow’s business and yours and the rest of the people of this state?
It’s to make sure that any activity that’s engaged in—including the raising of livestock—protects our drinking water and our air and the health and safety of our people.
"That’s the government’s responsibility and involvement, and we should be vigorous in terms of how we pursue that."
"And, we should leave no stone unturned in terms of the regulatory or the legislative structure that we have in place to deal with it."
"My grandchildren, just like a lot of yours, drink the water in South Dakota."
It doesn’t come from another state.
We all bathe in it and we all cook in it.
It’s in our selfish interest to make sure that we have the grandest and the best protection of these kinds of resources.
"And, very candidly, part of our problem is, is that we lived not too many years ago in a world where no one worried about where they poured the waste oil out of the car when they changed the oil in the back yard."
"Nobody worried about, if they had some stale gas in a container of just dumping it out into the yard."
Nobody worried about when a gas station was abandoned because the tanks leaked and they just let it leak.
Nobody worried about an old battery just being buried in the ground or buried rubber tires.
"Unfortunately, too many of us grew up in a time when that was the habit and the custom of the way you got rid of things."
And the world has become a lot more enlightened in terms of the impact and what it means for the long-term survivability and the long-term health of individuals to deal with those types of things.
"As most people in this state know, I suffer from a very, very rare allergy that’s called Acquired Cold Urticaria."
I’m literally allergic to cold.
"For me, it can be life threatening."
"I know some of you grin when I say that, but it could be life threatening.It’s a very serious problem."
"And, the Mayo Clinic has told me, in one of the studies I was in several years ago with them, that they don’t know for sure, but they believe it may have come from a massive overdose of insecticide 20-25 years ago and not of a recent nature."
"They don’t know, but as they continue to work forward on their research, they’re focusing in on that."
They believe that’s where that kind of damage to the immune system may have come from which has caused those types of problems for me.
All of us have to have a legitimate concern on looking out for the future.
"What we need to do, and we are, and we’ve done it in an incredibly positive and rapid way, notwithstanding a lot of criticisms in how we’ve moved forward as a society."
"Frankly, over the last 20 years, 25 years, going all the way back to Governor Kneip’s administration, how we’ve moved forward very aggressively—and, I realize, albeit at times with criticism, but aggressively—to protect those kinds of resources."
"But, changing farmers’ practices in how they apply herbicides, insecticides and pesticides is something that takes a lot of work, because it deals with the very fundamental changes in the economies of how agriculture is pursued."
Virtually every feedlot in South Dakota was built on a hill because it flowed down hill.
"Now we’ve come to realize that we can’t flow all those things into the tributaries that go into the creeks that go into the streams that go into rivers and what the long-term impacts are and the short-term impacts and what the exposure of nitrates to children—more than adults, but even to adults—can have an impact on people."
"The only point I’m belaboring on this is, dealing with the environmental aspect is the government’s responsibility."
"And, it is as much our responsibility to deal with it when it comes from hogs or cattle or people."
"Waste is waste, and what comes from an intestine from any mammal can be terribly dangerous and life threatening."
"And, so we have to be concerned about all of it."
"But, I submit we should look long and hard as a people before we start using an environmental argument, which is legit to be concerned about, using that argument to restrict the ability of agriculture producers or anybody else in America to make a decent living the best way they know how."
"Over the course of the last year, we’ve implemented the rules as required by the legislation for animal feeding, animal operations and the inspection rules."
We’ve developed and issued a general water pollution control permit that establishes standards for the protection of the state’s water resources.
"We awarded $32 million in grants and loans, which generated $95 million worth of construction in the last year for water, waste water and solid waste facilities."
We were one of the first five states in the nation that qualified and received our $12.5 million for the special funding for public water system upgrades throughout the state.
"We’ve conducted a pilot project in Plum Creek, which is a tributary to the Bad River which, at this point in time, it indicates that the new practices that are being used in that Plum Creek drainage area are having a 40 percent reduction in terms of impact on sediment flowing into the Bad River, which is causing this incredible problem of flooding in southeast Pierre and really threatening to destroy the areas—significant areas—in the community of Pierre and Fort Pierre."
"Utilizing the discretionary money that was available to me through the block grant that Senator Daschle, Senator Johnson and Congressman Thune helped make available, I gave $2.3 million worth of funding to the Vermillion River Basin to start to deal in a very, very material way with putting in place the facilities that are necessary to provide up to a 22 percent reduction on the 10-year flood in that Vermillion River Basin south of Lake Thompson."
We provided millions of dollars worth of funding to the community of Watertown to deal with their flood control efforts in terms of serious planning and implementation of flood control to be determined by the people that live in the area.
"And, we made the same thing available in the Pierre/Fort Pierre community in order to start to bring about serious results."
"I can report to you that I’ve dispensed, under that grant program, tens of millions of dollars throughout South Dakota for the building or the rebuilding of water, sewer, lagoon and other types of human safety environmental structures and infrastructure as a result of the federal aid that we got from the flooding in South Dakota this past summer and the threatened floods."
"And, I can also tell you Ladies and Gentlemen, and I just think that, and I realize I get some criticism when I say this, but I say it because I believe it."
"Senator Daschle in the position that he is in and the cooperative spirit that he has, has been terribly beneficial in terms of Bill Janklow and his administration’s ability to work with him."
I’ve been able to sit down and have in-depth discussions with Senator Johnson.
I’ve talked to him about enhancing the aspect of the way we work together.
"And, both of us are very committed to moving forward in that direction."
"Between those two Senators, they command significant committees in the United States Senate."
I’ve a great working relationship as does my team at the state level with Congressman Thune.
"I realize this is an election year, and I realize the impact, frankly, of what it is that I am saying."
"I report to South Dakota, in terms of the ability of elected officials to work after the election, I’ve never in all my years in government had better ability to work with the broad group that we have with this group as we work with them—Thune in the House and the other two in the Senate—and what we are able, frankly, to get done teaming together for the people of South Dakota."
"In terms of welfare reform, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is just headed towards a phenomenal set of accomplishments."
"Given the authority that you gave us last year when you passed the legislation in what we call TANF which is the old ADC/AFDC program, I can tell you that in December of 1996, we had—the red bar represent those people who are drawing public assistance."
"Now, this excludes Sisseton, because I can report to you the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe has taken over the operation of the TANF program within the area where the former reservation was located up there in northeast South Dakota."
"And, they have taken that over, provided the seed money and they are operating and we have turned over to them their proportionate share of the federal grant that was made available to us."
They’re providing their resources for the local money and they are operating that program.
We continue to operate it in the other eight tribal areas in South Dakota.
The red line represents the individuals who draw assistance living within the boundaries of one of the reservations or in one of the Indian-controlled areas.
"In 1996 in December, we had 1,885."
"At the end of December this year, 1,652.A 12 percent reduction."
"We had 1,871 individuals off the reservation of all races on AFDC/ADC in December of ’96."
Today we have 939; we have a 50 percent reduction.
This program is a phenomenal success.
"I can also report to you that the average wage earned this past year by people going to work under the Welfare Assistance Program, except for Minnehaha County, is $6.05 an hour."
That’s almost a dollar above the minimum wage that this Legislature raised it to a year ago.
"So, they are not going to work on average for, as somebody said, just minimum wage—as if that lacked dignity when they made that statement anyhow."
"If you work honorably for your work and you get paid, there’s dignity in it and some people have just never figured that out."
"But, the average wage is $6.05."
"In Minnehaha County, the average wage for people going to work under the TANF program is $6.75 an hour."
"These individuals are making money instead of taking money from the taxpayers and, at the same time, and more importantly, building themselves towards their self-sufficiency and being able to take care of themselves and their families in the future as we slowly wind down the assistance that we still provide to these people and individuals as they go to work."
The next chart kind of draws the picture for you on where we’re at statewide.
"If a county’s in red today, as of today, there isn’t a single welfare or TANF case in the county.Zero."
"If a county is in yellow, there’s only one case in the county where there’s one family where they meet the work participation requirements."
There’s only one family in the county that’s on the TANF program.
"And, if your county is in blue on there, or the county is in blue, there are five or less cases in the county of people on public assistance."
"Now, what I asked them to do when we started this effort was concentrate—we started originally on a pilot project done out of Rapid City."
It worked so well out there even before TANF that we then moved that program to Yankton and on up to Sioux Falls and started implementing in other places.
"But, what I asked the Social Services and Labor Department to do, because the Job Service side of this—when you go in to apply for welfare today in South Dakota, the first person you see is the Job Service representative."
"You don't see a welfare worker, you see a Job Service representative and then you work from there."
"What I asked them to do is let’s get out and really concentrate on cleaning up the effort in the rural areas, so we can turn our attention to focus it where we’re really going to ultimately have to concentrate a lot more of the state’s resources—Pennington County, Minnehaha County, Shannon County, Todd County and some of the other counties throughout the state."
"But, you can see the success of this program Ladies and Gentlemen."
"As I say, if it’s in red there are none.If it’s in yellow there’s one."
"And, if it’s blue it’s less then five."
"Over the last couple of years, we’ve been dealing with a Beginning Farmer Program in the state."
"That Beginning Farmer Program, I can report to you, has issued $6.2 million worth of loans that have helped 71 beginning farmers."
"This is a program really where we issue the bonds and we make approvals, but it’s not state money or a state program."
It’s really something through the Bankers Association.
"These beginning 71 farmers have been involved in the purchase of almost 21,000 acres of ground and basically 560 head of livestock."
"The initial loan rate is about 7.15 percent, which is anywhere from 2.5 to 3 percent below the market rate."
"The average age is 30, but the recipients of this program as beginning farmers run the age of 18 all the way to 48 years of age.Hunting."
It’s an emotional issue that Bill Janklow’s been staying out of for the last year.
It’s kind of like when two people are going to get a divorce.
They hate each other so much in the beginning it doesn’t do any good to work with them.They’ve got to cool down.
"And, here we’ve got an issue that involves people that want to hunt and people that own ground."
"And, it’s an issue unfortunately that’s really starting to tear the guts out of this state in a very personal way as people start making personal attacks on each other."
You need only look at the comments in the newspaper.
You need only read the letters to the editor.
You need only see what’s being said about each other to realize how destructive this is becoming.
What we really need to do is all take a good deep breath.
"Take a walk around the block, tone down the rhetoric a little and see—maybe there’s no solution."
Maybe it’s just destined by God that we have to hate each other forever.
"But just in case it isn’t, let’s just calm down a little bit and sit back and look at a couple things."
"One, we have an absolute responsibility to put mechanisms in place to protect a landowner’s right to their land.Period.Period.Period.It’s their land."
"And, absent some abuse they do to it as a tenant on the way to eternity, absent some abuse, they’ve got a right to deal with their land in their own way and determine who comes on it and who doesn’t."
"Within that framework, South Dakota has always been a state where one of the great attributes of being able to live out here, even though we didn’t have the economic basis and a lot of other things that others had, was the ability of families to come together in the great outdoors."
"One of them happened to be the experience of going out in a family sense with hunting and the outdoor experience, whether it was bird, or upland game, or four feet.We’ve always had that harmony."
"And, yes there’s always been a little friction but not at this level."
"I realize there are certain factors that are complicating it, but all I’m asking is that the Legislature—it’s not a problem that we should ignore and where we’ve got South Dakotans hurting like they are and at each other like they are—I think we all have a responsibility to sit down and try and come up with some methodology and some legislation that provides material protections to landowners."
"And recognizing, that if we’re going to have hunting in the long run in South Dakota, it’s got to be something that people that work for average means can afford to do, and not just pay $100, $200 whatever it is a day per gun to go hunting, because people out there that make $7 and $8 and $9 a hour that have a family cannot afford to participate in it."
"And, once something loses its broad-based political support, I can guarantee you in a democracy the first thing that happens is we start regulating it, and then we tax it to death, and ultimately we destroy it."
"So for the good of all of us, let’s see if there’s a way over the next couple of months to try and make some definitive steps where we could really help try and solve the problem by protecting the landowners’ rights and at the same time protecting what has been at least the historical opportunity of working people in South Dakota of average means to have an experience within the framework of what they can afford to have access to hunting with themselves and their families."
"Very briefly, I’d just like to report to you that over the course of last year and in keeping with my philosophy of really trying to get things done at a 100 percent, more work was done on the Mickelson Trail in the Black Hills in 1997 than in the previous six years combined."
"Fort Sisseton, almost all the work in the restoration of it was done in 1997."
We’ve recently made a land acquisition of 566 acres in Kingsbury County in the area between Lake Thompson and Lake Henry.
"As I indicated when a newspaper man asked me about it that day, a local newspaper, as long as we got lemons up here we might as well try and turn it into lemonade."
"But the state will now own 5.5 new miles of shoreline that will be developed along with the rest of it into a public access area for families in South Dakota to come and enjoy the water, water skiing, fishing, boating, beaches, waterfowl hunting, and what have you."
The Adams Homestead has been completed.
"It’s a 1,500-acre donation down in the southeast corner of the state that Mary and Maude Adams, Mary Adams is the sister that is still alive and with us, who made the bequest on behalf of her sister Maude and the rest of the family."
"It’s still in its pristine original condition, a lot of it that was never farmed."
"It’s the ground never broken with hundreds of acres of cottonwood trees, 7.5 miles worth of trails have been built down there."
"It’s truly a treasure of South Dakota, this gift that those ladies gave us and how Game, Fish and Parks has been able to develop it."
"I can report to you that Blood Run the purchase was completed for the vast majority of it, once I was made aware of how important it was that we do something with respect to Blood Run in the state.One additional thing."
"The issues that have plagued this state involve, property tax relief—being one of them."
Everybody’s got their view on it.
Everybody’s got their position.
"But I can tell you when I ran for Governor three years ago both Mr. Beddow and I, who were opposed to each other, both made a commitment to South Dakota that we would work to get 30 percent property tax relief."
"I realize that some of the emotion has died down, not the commitment, but the emotion by people."
"But I also know that revolt came from eight years of property taxes growing for schools, for counties and for municipalities at three times the rate of inflation, the largest sustained increase in the history of South Dakota over an eight-year period."
Therein were the seeds of the property tax revolt.
"When taxes are growing at three times the rate of inflation, you better believe you’re going to get into trouble at some point in time."
And that property tax revolt almost passed in its legislation.
The only difference were a few minor things and the time period within which the commitment was made to get it done.
"As I’ve indicated before and I’ll say again, I refuse to say that I would do it in three or four years during the campaign because I said I’ve been there before in that office."
"I never know what comes up, and I won’t make a promise that I can’t keep in that regard."
But I will keep as my goal leading my party and this Legislature and the people towards property tax relief of 30 percent.
During our budget we asked for 3.5 percent property tax relief.
When we started out this year we talked about adversity.
When I started my speech today I talked about adversity.
High school coaches tell their kids that adversity builds character.
I think adversity reveals character.
"And, yes, after this spring’s floods receded, God gave us some tremendous opportunities and breaks."
There’s no question that God gave us breaks with the weather.
"South Dakota turned to and really started building and rebuilding and reinvesting, and I can report to the Legislature now that economically we look better than we did when I presented that budget a month ago, because we have another month’s worth of receipts in."
"So I’m asking the Legislature to modify the budget request that I made when we presented it back the first of December and, instead of 3.5 percent property tax relief, that the Legislature award this year and additional 5 percent property tax relief."
That will take us to 25 percent.
"That will take us, if it’s passed, to 25 percent of the 30 percent commitment that both my friends in the Democratic party, and my party, the Republican party, made to the people of South Dakota during the election three years ago."
"We’ve got a responsibility to keep our word to the public, and I can tell you, that with the additional revenues that we see, it’s going to be close.It’s going to be tight."
"But, we will manage the government in such a way that if the Legislature sees fit to authorize an additional 1.5 percent to the 3.5 percent that we asked, that we would have a total of 5 percent property tax relief that would go to the people of the state beginning with the next go-around."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time for me to submit to you folks the work of creating the laws for our people."
It’s something you all understand.
"Every one of you, including the one that was appointed recently, the new member, are veterans of the legislative process."
Everybody talks in the press about how they’re not going to play politics and then they go play politics.
"I understand how that’s done, but we’ve all got a responsibility within the framework of what I’ll call, playing the politics, to do the serious business of taking care of the needs of the people of South Dakota so, we not only don’t create problems, that we not only solve problems, but we take what actions are necessary to prevent problems from happening."
"And, so it gives me a great deal of pleasure, and I appreciate, and I say this in a humble way, the time you’ve given me here today to run through these major things that I’ve addressed on what really is the State-of-the-State in South Dakota and where we’re at."
"Yes, a year ago today I came before you in adversity."
It didn’t build anybody’s character.
It showed the character of South Dakota.
"Whether it was those snowmobilers that went out in the night looking for folks by Sioux Falls, the people up there by Webster that went out looking for Mrs. Nelson."
"Whether it was the National Guard man and a prisoner from the state penitentiary who, after I gave a direct order to evacuate the James Valley Christian School compound, begged, just the two of them, for one opportunity to go back down there where that National Guard caterpillar was, at driving through four feet of water as it’s coming in, and still try and push and plug a hole in the dike with the possibility that a 15-foot wall of water would fall down upon them, or, whether it epitomizes the spirit of what that young lady, Ashlie, teaches all of us."
Yours and my responsibility is to make sure that Ashlie and all the rest of the young people like her are given the same opportunity that Bill Janklow and all of you had—to live in a great place like South Dakota.
"To live in a place like South Dakota that offers the opportunity and the enrichment, which South Dakota offers each and every one of us."
I look forward to working with each and every one of you.
I look forward to the challenge of addressing the issues of this state head-on and I look forward to the challenge of working with all of you and the citizens of this state as we make sure that we don’t create problems--we solve them.
That we don’t ignore problems—we address them.That we do the people’s work.
God bless South Dakota and thank you all very much.Thank you.
