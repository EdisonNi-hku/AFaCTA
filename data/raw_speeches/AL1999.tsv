Tonight the people’s business begins.
The people of Alabama hired us to do a job.
They expect results, and we are going to give them results.
First, the people want the best education for their children.
That means college scholarships.
That means voluntary pre-kindergarten.
That means state-of-the art computers.
That means accountability.
And that means safe schools.
That is the people’s agenda, and that is my agenda.
Together, we will get it done.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no better investment, no higher priority, than our children’s education.
We must ensure that every child, regardless of where they are born or to whom, has the same hope and expectation that they can attend college, get a good job and provide for their family’s future.
We will write a new chapter for Alabama public education.
We will change education in Alabama forever.
We will demand accountability in the classroom.
We will demand higher graduation standards from our children, we will end social promotion and demand higher standards from our teachers and from our principals.
That is what Alabama parents want, that is what our children deserve and that is what our children will have.
There is a plague of violence in our schools, and I’m going to do something about it.
And I mean business.
"My School Violence Act mandates a ""One Strike and You’re Out"" Policy on guns and drugs."
But we won’t stop there.
We will create a statewide system of alternative schools.
We will get chronic troublemakers out of our classrooms so that the rest of our students can learn in peace.
But we won’t stop there.
Safe schools also mean safe, permanent classrooms.
When we are done, unsafe portable and substandard classrooms of any shape, size or description will be eliminated from our schools.
But we won’t stop there.
We must recruit and keep the best and the brightest teachers for our classrooms.
I am committed to raising teachers and principals salaries to the national average.
But we won’t stop there.
We will invest in teacher training.
Research shows that teacher training is the single most effective method of increasing student performance.
I propose funding two new teacher training days, days that will give our teachers the skills they’ll need to teach technology in the new century.
We will continue teacher training with the Alabama Reading Initiative.
Teachers will attend intensive seminars to learn how to identify children with reading problems and how to teach every child to read better.
Since using the reading initiative, the Verner Elementary School in Tuscaloosa reports that 64 percent, nearly two-thirds, of their students are reading a full year above their grade level.
We will provide 4 million dollars for this program, and I pledge to take this program statewide during my term as governor.
And we will reward teaching excellence.
Tonight we have with us three winners of the American Teacher Award – Cathy Hess Wright, Gary Moore and Sara Bopp Strange – all from Booker T. Washington Magnet High School here in Montgomery.
This annual award is given to only 36 teachers nationwide.
Also with us here are Cheryl Carter and Henry Terry – winners of the Readers Digest American Heroes in Education Award.
Each year there are only ten awards given across the nation and two of them are right here in Alabama.
Ladies and Gentlemen, please help me in welcoming these outstanding teachers.
We need to reward teachers like these and encourage others.
And so tonight, I announce that the state of Alabama will award a $5,000 grant for every teacher who receives National Board Certification, one of the highest honors a teacher can receive.
I challenge the private sector to match this award, making the grant worth $10,000.
In exchange for investing in teachers, we will demand accountability.
Alabama will have new teacher testing and we will have tough evaluations for tenured teachers.
And parents need to be assured that when they leave their children – their most precious possession – at school they are left in the safest hands possible.
We will demand background checks for teachers.
But we won’t stop there.
We will begin to reduce overcrowding in our classrooms.
We will hire more teachers – 600 new teachers this year– for Alabama’s classrooms, targeted at kindergarten through the third grade where children need more individual attention.
Adults in this state have created the toughest high school graduation exam in America, yet we have not spent one penny to prepare students for these new standards.
That is not fair, that is not right and that is not smart.
It is simply not enough to brag about how tough your exam is and how many students will fail.
When all our students can pass the exam, that will be the time for Alabama to brag.
We must allocate some of the $38 million dollars currently targeted to at-risk students for tutorial assistance so those students have a fighting chance at that exam.
And I ask colleges and universities to help me meet this challenge.
On top of all that, we will introduce the most important education legislation in this state’s history: the Alabama Education Lottery.
We’re going to start by giving our children the head start they deserve with voluntary pre-kindergarten.
We’re going to put the world’s knowledge at the fingertips of every Alabama child.
State-of-the-art computers and advanced technology will expand educational opportunities into every school in this state.
And yes, we’ll tear down the financial barriers that have held our children back.
We’re going to open the doors of college to every high school graduate.
You know my plan – every high school student who stays in school, stays out of trouble and makes their grades will be able to go on to college tuition free.
That will be Alabama’s HOPE College Scholarship Program.
And we will pay for it all – pre-kindergarten, computers, and college scholarships – with the Alabama Education Lottery.
The Naysayers, and yes, there are even some here tonight, say it can’t be done.
Well folks, you know it can be done because it is being done right now in the State of Georgia.
More than 360,000 Georgia High School students and their families have benefited from Georgia’s HOPE College Scholarship Program.
More than 240,000 Georgia 4-year-olds have gotten their head start with voluntary pre-kindergarten.
And every school in Georgia has a satellite dish outside and state-of-the-art computers inside.
So, don’t try to tell us it can’t be done.
And there are some who say we don’t need a lottery in Alabama.
Folks, let’s be honest here for a moment.
We already have a lottery in Alabama.
In fact, 18 out of 24 Alabama daily newspapers run the results of the Georgia or Florida lotteries in their newspapers.
Why?
Because they know what you and I know: Their readers are buying lottery tickets and they want to know if they have won.
Hundreds of millions of Alabama dollars have left Alabama to buy lottery tickets in Georgia and Florida.
I say it’s time for that money to stay here in Alabama to give our children pre-kindergarten, our students computers and our high school graduates college scholarships.
I come here tonight with a message from the people.
They demand – demand – the right to vote on an Alabama Education Lottery.
Tomorrow I’ll ask the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, to act expeditiously on my proposed education lottery amendment.
My amendment is modeled on the successful lottery in Georgia, and it contains every safeguard the people of Alabama want.
The Education Lottery Amendment will create the Alabama Lottery Corporation.
It will be run by professional business people – not politicians or their friends.
Every single lottery dollar – 100 percent - will go to education and nowhere else.
The Education Lottery Amendment will fund college scholarships, pre-kindergarten and school technology, in that order.
A special Education Lottery Reserve Fund will be created to insure complete funding for education programs, rain or shine.
We will not let the politicians get their hands on one penny of this money.
Lottery dollars will be in addition to, not in the place of, current education money.
And hear me: There will be no casinos in Alabama.
Now I say: Let the people of Alabama vote.
I’m here to ask you, the members of the House and Senate to join me, because supporting an education lottery is one of the most important things you can do for the families of Alabama.
This question is so critical to the future of Alabama that only the people should have the right to decide.
Let the people vote.
This education question is so important to our future that it should not be decided by 140 members of the legislature.
Four million Alabamians should decide.
Let the people vote.
How can anyone or any special interest say the people shouldn’t be allowed to vote on this vital education issue?
We should trust the common sense and judgment of the people of Alabama.
The people of Alabama will do the right thing.
The question tonight is: Will you?
Let the people vote.
While the House is considering the Education Lottery Amendment, I will present my budgets to the state Senate.
While the House is focusing on the Education Lottery, I am asking the Senate to focus on the budgets.
This year, Governing Magazine told us what many of us already knew – the state of Alabama has been without management for several years.
"Our state received the grade of ""D"" for the management of our tax dollars."
For this budget year, state agencies asked for $300 million dollars more than exists in the entire General Fund.
This has got to stop.
We must start getting our fiscal house in order right now.
What should we do?
I’ll tell you what we should do.
We will manage state tax dollars just like Alabama families manage their money: We will prioritize.
We will put the children of Alabama first.
We will insist that our seniors receive the quality care they have earned by keeping all services intact.
And we will make our communities and our homes safer by increasing funding for Alabama’s prison system and the Department of Youth Services.
The budgets that I have presented are conservative.
They are austere.
And when the proposed Education Lottery and the Budgets are passed, I will ask the House and the Senate to focus on crime bills coming from Attorney General Bill Pryor and myself.
My message to criminals is this: Alabama will show you the same mercy that you showed your victims.
None.
We will get tough on domestic violence.
We will make domestic violence a crime in Alabama.
Repeat offenders who commit violence against their families will go to jail.
And there will be no exceptions.
If you dare to commit domestic violence in front of your children, you will also be charged with cruelty to children.
And we will show no mercy for child sexual predators.
We will make chemical castration a condition of probation or parole for adults who rape, sodomize or otherwise sexually assault children 12 years of age or younger.
For repeat adult sexual predators who violently rape or sodomize our children: Hear me.
We will give judges and juries the right to sentence you to death.
Juvenile thugs are about to learn a very hard lesson.
In my state, juvenile thugs who commit violent adult crimes will do adult time.
Hard time.
Finally, we will increase the penalties for adults driving drunk with a young child in the car.
The adult has a choice.
The child does not.
That is my agenda for this session, and those are my priorities.
But I need your help to achieve it.
On November 3rd, the people of Alabama hired you and me.
They hired us to do a job.
To work together.
To represent their interests.
They sent us here to make education our top priority.
They sent us here to make their schools and communities safer.
They sent us here to get their business done.
They did not send us here for petty political fights and partisan bickering.
It should make no difference if a good idea comes from Democrats or Republicans.
If it's best for the people of Alabama, then we will do it.
So tonight, I extend my hand to each and every one of you.
Not just for this session, but for the next four years.
To work for the common interests we all share.
That is my pledge to you and my pledge to the people of Alabama.
Meet me halfway and we will achieve great things for our great state.
As I said in my inaugural address, we will not live in the gray twilight.
We will dare mighty things.
It is time for Alabama to believe in itself again.
It is time for all of us to pull together, to work harder, to aim higher than ever before to fight for Alabama’s future.
A great future is within our grasp.
But we must have the courage and the discipline to reach for it.
Years from now, when a new generation of Alabama leaders takes this stage…….
Years from now, living in an Alabama that is the educational and economic envy of the South….
Years from now a new generation will look back at this moment … at this time … at you in this chamber and say: You made the critical difference.
Together, with your help and God’s blessings we can and we will make Alabama that state it can be.
Thank you.
God bless you and God bless the great state of Alabama.
