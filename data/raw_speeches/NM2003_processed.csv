SENTENCES
I want to end the food tax.
The gross receipts tax on the food thatgoes on the plates of New Mexico families is an unconscionable reach into thepockets of New Mexico breadwinners.
I would like to see it go away.
"Additionally, the gross receipts tax on payments to physicians from commercialHMOs should go away."
"The gross receipts tax is forcing doctors to leave ourstate, threatening the health and welfare of our communities — particularly in ruralNew Mexico."
Why should the rest of us care?
For the same reason we should care aboutteacher’s salaries.
"If we can’t attract physicians to New Mexico, our access tohealth care will be hurt."
It is already occurring in some specialties.
We must makecertain it doesn’t get worse -- and eliminating the gross receipts tax on doctor feesis one important place to start us on a new pat to progress in health care.
"These tax changes are only quick fixes, however."
"I intend to appoint a TaxReform Commission to review the many good tax system studies of recent years,factor in the development and tax policy priorities of this administration, andcome up with a comprehensive redesign of New Mexico’s entire tax structure."
"Iwill bring the results to a special session of the Legislature, so that the taxquestions can be fairly debated without the distraction of other issues."
I also willundertake in-depth studies of education and government reorganization.
It can’t be just tax cuts if we are to keep our state budget balanced.
I am proposingan additional $5 million to the Department of Taxation and Revenue to beef upcollection and enforcement efforts -- with an immediate revenue enhancement ofat least $50 million as the goal.
The target is delinquent taxes; the goal is thateverybody pay only their fair share.
"We still must raise the money to pay the costs of providing services tocitizens -- but it must be done in the fairest way possible, in a way that sends thebest economic signals to the larger economy and its entrepreneurs who play sucha role in New Mexico’s economic future."
"This administration is going to beat the bushes from coast to coast, from Europeto the Pacific Rim, seeking quality companies in need of good workers and agreat environment into which to expand their companies."
"But, our economic development strategy doesn’t depend on industrial recruitmentalone."
We must make the state of New Mexico a hospitable place forentrepreneurs to start and grow their business ideas.
"Whether from outside or from homegrown visionaries, ground-up business development must beencouraged and nurtured by state policy."
I have already said I intend to spend at least 25 percent of my time working oneconomic development.
We will undertake these efforts at many levels and withmany concepts.
Growing tourism and trade with Mexico is a theater ofdevelopment with great promise -- particularly with our sister border state ofChihuahua.
"In cooperation with Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, I will work tobuild up the business and cultural bonds between our people."
"As New Mexicanslearn more about Chihuahua, more will wish to visit and do business there."
Thesame is true the other way to New Mexico.
"Here at home, we need to strengthen the teaching of business andentrepreneurial skills in our schools."
Our young people must be taught the basicsof business risk and reward so that more of them will take to improving their livesand building the economy of our state from within.
Small business incubatorprograms in the population centers of the state must be strengthened andimproved.
"Access to capital is critical -- and because we lie so far from the money centers ofthe coasts, we remain below the radar of much of the venture capital market."
TheLegislature invested $10 million in the New Mexico Small Business InvestmentCorporation -- but the money has languished in a bank account for lack of animplementation strategy.
I will build that implementation strategy.
I further propose that we invest up to$200 million -- just 2 percent of the total in the state’s Permanent Funds — in NewMexico businesses.
This will jump-start an entrepreneurial arm of New Mexico’seconomy.
"We will work with existing grass-roots business start-up organizationssuch as ACCION, WESST Corp. the New Mexico Community DevelopmentFund."
"With our new State Investment Officer, we have ensured the best expertiseto manage and control the commitment of state venture funds."
We will partnerwith private capital.
"While the primary purpose of our state’s permanent funds must always be toprovide revenue to state government, we must also invest them where fiscallyprudent to create jobs and diversify our economy."
"By stepping up with cash, we will send a signal that New Mexico is serious aboutbusiness and willing to put our money where our recruitment is."
"To facilitate all these ambitious development goals, I ask the Legislature for seedmoney."
"--I would like to add $15 million to the in-plant training fund, bringing it to $20million when combined with existing funds."
-$3 million to fun a nonprofit corporation to recruit and market new businessesand jobs.
We must tap the skills and leverage the efforts of everyone to grow theeconomy.
"-$9 million in a one-shot expenditure to complete the funding of endowed chairsin business and technology research at the University of New Mexico, NewMexico Tech and New Mexico State University."
"-$150,000 to expand the New Mexico Border Authority budget in the areas ofmarketing, customer service and recruitment."
"-$100,000 to create an economic development commission to follow up ontrade expansion with Chihuahua."
"-$250,000 a year for three years for a new commission charged withprotecting New Mexico’s four military bases as base realignment again becomes anational priority."
Give me the tools and I will work with you to start us on the path tothe high-wage economy we all want to build.
This is a partnership -- between thegovernor and the Legislature -- a partnership for the long haul.
We need to do more -- much more -- for health care.
Gross receipts taxrelief for doctors is only a first step.
New Mexico was a national leader in the growth of managed care and the healthmaintenance organization for organizing the industry.
"As a result, primary controlof health-care services is concentrated in a handful of conglomerates."
The lastadministration took this development a giant step farther by giving the HMOsmanagement of Medicaid -- the federal program that is a major financialcomponent of almost everything that happens in health care.
The result --intended or not-- is that Medicaid and commercial health insurance are joined atthe hip.
Hard times in Medicaid will be made up by raising the premiums chargedcommercial customers.
Higher premiums will reduce the number of peoplecovered -- which in turn increases the financial pinch on the big HMOs — startingthe whole cycle over again.
We must reshape or reform our health-care industry in ways that extend healthinsurance coverage to more people.
"I don’t believe a single-payer system is the answer to universal coverage, but we must -- and will -- find ways to makehealth-care coverage more universal for our state’s citizens."
The broader the reachof coverage the greater the stability in the industry.
We need to provide prescription drug relief to our senior citizens.
This should beaccomplished through Medicaid for low-income and disabled seniors.
"For all seniors, I will enter into forceful negotiations with drug companies toobtain the largest possible price discounts."
I agree with those who say prescriptiondrug coverage for senior citizens is a federal responsibility -- but we can’t simplyignore the problem at the state level.
We also must take additional measures to ensure an adequate force ofhealth-care professionals to serve the needs of this state.
"I propose to recruit and retain quality doctors and nurses by expanding nursingprograms at our institutions of higher learning, and by offering scholarships andother financial incentives."
"In the last reporting year, New Mexico had 175physicians per 100,000 residents, compared to 242 nationally."
I propose $4 million for scholarships and other financial incentives to thesehealth-care professionals while they are in training.
We ll require them to practicehere in New Mexico.
"Like education, there is no single silver-bullet solution to the problems in ourhealth-care system."
It will take intensive study and unremitting work to find cost-effective solutions.
The Legislature is an indispensable partner in this effort.
The legislative Medicaid Reform Committee just reported on nine months ofstudy on the almost $2 billion a year program.
This administration will make thatstudy the starting point from which to decide what must be done in the short term.
I need the tools to put out the fiscal fires -- and to make prudent long-termchanges as they are developed.
We will move quickly and decisively to secure the future of our water supply --the lifeblood of our people and our environment.
-We must improve our capabilities for using our water wisely.
I am proposingthe expenditure of $200 million for water projects around the state -- 10 percentof the state’s bonding capacity for the next 20 years.
"Wisely spent, this investmentwill help us stretch this critical resource farther."
"-We will honor the rights to water guaranteed to farmers and ranchers, tribes and pueblos, and municipalities by the New Mexico Constitution."
TheRichardson administration will protect water users from all threats foreign anddomestic.
"-We must modify our laws and practices to secure water flows for ourenvironment, from the high mountain watersheds to the riparian ecosystems alongour streams and rivers."
But we must accomplish this through consultation and thebest science -- not by the blunt club of litigation.
-Compliance with the water delivery requirements of NewMexico’s interstate stream compacts will also be a priority.
We will be vulnerableto onerous sanctions if we fail to meet our obligations to Texas and Mexico.
"On the practical side, we will put immediate emphasis on determining the sizeand priority of water rights on all the state’s rivers and streams."
"The purpose ofwater adjudication is to protect the rights of water users, and facilitate the transferof rights among willing buyers and sellers."
"And obviously, we all need to knowwhat we have before we can cooperate fully to secure the sustainability of ournatural environment."
On the Rio Grande -- the mother stream of New Mexico -- we will redoubleefforts to reach a fair and mutual water settlement with the four pueblos in the 40-year-old Aamodt adjudication.
It is important that New Mexico and its sovereignpueblos reach agreement as a first step in adjudicating the Rio Grande from theColorado border to Elephant Butte on the South.
But four decades spent on a case that covers only a small portion of theheadwaters of the Rio Grande is too long.There has to be a better way.
"We are committed to streamlining the system ofwater rights adjudication, to make it less adversarial and more understandable."
We will not allow the Rio Grande to become a sterile flow in a concrete andgravel ditch.
"But again: The rights and interests of human users of thisindispensable resource will be protected even as the environment surrounding itspassage downstream is restored, protected, and elevated in importance."
We willfind cooperative ways to combine the needs of human use of water and theenvironmental needs of water flows.
We will continue efforts to bring water use on the Pecos to a level enabling NewMexico to stay in compliance with the Supreme Court on our obligation to Texas.
We will look beyond our southern border to Texas and Mexico.
We will open andsustain a continuing discussion with our fellow stewards of the Rio Grande.
Wewill make mutual problem-solving by negotiation the priority of this state as wecooperate with our neighbors on water quality and quantity and on environmentalconsiderations.
"We must find and build upon those things on which we can agree,before we venture into the minefield of litigation."
"We must address our water challenges NOW, if we are to prosper for the longhaul."
I ask you -- the elected representatives of the citizens of New Mexico -- towork with me so that we can secure a viable water supply for future generations.
New Mexico’s energy industry is the bedrock upon which our private economyhas been built.
The energy industry contributes a little over 25 percent of ourannual state government revenue -- $1.3 billion in 2001.
"Oil, natural gas, electricgeneration -- New Mexico producesenergy for consumption here and across the country."
"We are cast in this role notbecause we chose it, but because vast reserves of these energy fuels lie beneathour landscape."
But even our energy industry must change and adjust to the new imperatives ofthe 21st century.
Oil and Gas operations must be brought up to the mostenvironmentally clean standards of operation possible.
"Even as we are rich in hydrocarbons beneath the surface, we are rich in wind,solar, geothermal and biomass energy potential across our landscape."
I have set agoal of having 10 percent of New Mexico’s energy come from renewable sourcesby 2010.
The state Public Regulation Commission has already moved our electricgenerating industry in that direction.
The Legislature has established taxincentives to help the fledgling renewable energy industry components catch upand compete.
"We are on a path to progress, but we must do more."
"With long-term energysources uncertain, New Mexico must develop renewable energy technology foruse by New Mexicans -- and in the long run as a continuing export industry forour economy, creating jobs and opportunity — particularly in our rural areas."
This can be accomplished through tax policy and regulation and by continuingalternative energy research in our national laboratories and institutions of higherlearning.
It is only through the joining of the best scientific knowledge with themost skilled entrepreneurial development that renewable energy will ever attainits rightful stature in the economy.
"Some 23,000 New Mexicans work in the oil and gas industry in New Mexico."
That is good but I want the industry to do better.
"I want you to bring your regionaloffices to this state, along with hundreds of well-paying jobs -- jobs in the$75,000 to $125,000 range."
"Here is where your action is; we want yourheadquarters operations, too."
"The Richardson administration intends to make the energy industry in this statestronger, environmentally cleaner and diversified away from the fossil fuels thathave underpinned our economy for so long."
New Mexico’s energy industry has tochange along with the rest of us.
Give me the tools and I will help make thishappen in a cooperative and collaborative way.
"Although our Constitution guarantees all Americans the opportunity to pursuehappiness, it s the State s responsibility to pursue those who hijack our hopes."
Tothose criminals who savage our society drunk drivers and domestic abusers Ihave a message your behavior will not be tolerated.
"Whether the bullet is 45caliber or 4500 pounds, I m committed to the safety of all New Mexicans."
̊The decibel level about the scourge of DWI in New Mexico couldn t be louder.
"Yet this weekend a drunk driver is likely to destroy an unsuspecting family, aswell as their own."
I am committed to alcohol treatment as a component of ourfight to get drunk drivers from behind the wheel.
"I m just as committed to puttingthem behind bars for longer periods of time, when necessary."
"̊For those who continue to taunt the system by driving even after their license hasbeen revoked for DWI, if we can t bend your will, we ll take your wheels."
"̊For those who taunt fate with the lives of children by driving drunk with kids inthe car, you ll be facing one of the most potent child endangerment laws in thecountry."
"̊For drunk drivers under the age of 21, if you thought the wait to get your driver slicense when you were 15 was long, it ll be a flash compared to the wait to get itback."
"̊I also realize that the progress we have made against DWI in the streets, losestraction in our Courts."
"I ll be calling upon the Chief Justice of the New MexicoSupreme Court, the Honorable Petra Maes, to be a partner in public safety, bychanging rules and procedures that demand respect from criminals and earn therespect of our citizens."
̊The First Lady and I have already commenced an unprecedented campaignagainst domestic violence and sexual assaults.
We must prevent today s children from becoming tomorro ws criminals by tackling truancy and restoring the familytraditions that are the soul of our state.
̊Criminals steal lives and property and our criminal justice system often stealsthe victim s dignity.
I ll be creating an office of victim s rights compliance letno New Mexican be unheard again.̊Let’s talk multi-culture.I am a Hispanic.
But Hispanic governors are not that rare in this state.
NewMexico came into the Union with a population in which Hispanics were themajority -- and we Hispanics have been active participants in the cultural andpolitical process ever since.
The political power of New Mexico’s Hispanics has helped enforce apractical cultural tolerance that is stronger here than in any other state.
It hasprovided the foundation for a continually growing and changing culturaldiversity.
"We have always understood that our culture, our land, our heritage andour traditions are our greatest strength."
They bind us together to make NewMexico what it is today.
They will hold us together for the long haul.
"But while Hispanics have long enjoyed political power and influence, NativeAmericans have lagged in participation in the affairs of state government."
This ischanging in the Richardson administration.
"Today, you see Native Americans in all levels of state government leadership asco-equals with their Anglo, Hispanic and African American colleagues."
ConroyChino of Acoma pueblo is my secretary of labor.
"Derith Watchman-Moore, aNavajo, serves as deputy secretary of the Environment Department."
"Hilary C. Tompkins, a Navajo, serves as deputy counsel to the Governor."
"Bernie Teba,Santa Clara Pueblo, is director of the Office of Indian Affairs, and Lynn Trujillo,Sandia Pueblo, is general counsel."
"David Eisenberg of Taos Pueblo is DeputyPublic Defender, and Butch Blazer, a Mescalero Apache, is Forestry Director inthe Department of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources."
These are only a fewof the many who will be part of a Richardson Administration.
"I have placed Native Americans in positions of trust and responsibilitythroughout state government, as well as on state boards and commissions."
"And letme make one thing clear:While I set out to find and appoint Native Americans in my administration, thesemen and women are in their positions first because of their leadership abilitiesand qualifications -- not because they are Native Americans."
I want our Native Americans to be full partners in directing the future of the statewe share.
"I want their input into government -- and through their presence at alllevels of government, it is my hope that all Native Americans will reach a greaterunderstanding and trust of their state government."
"The Pueblo governors and I have already held a summit meeting in which wesigned a formal agreement covering continuing communication and cooperation,government to government, to address the needs and concerns of the pueblos andstate government."
Native American governments negotiate in good faith.
Thatshould always be recognized and reciprocated by their non-Indian counterparts.
We must coordinate the business interests of Native Americans and the state.
"After years of neglect in Santa Fe, I am proud to announce my wholeheartedsupport for the renovation of Highway 666 (a name we are working to change)from Gallup to Shiprock, on the Navajo Nation, and I have directed the Secretaryof Transportation to cooperate fully with the Navajo Nation in this effort."
We will cooperate in promotional activities with the destination resorts that arespringing up around Native American gaming facilities.
They bring a newdimension to the attractions of New Mexico’s tourist industry.There is so much to be done.
There is so much opportunity for this state and itspeople.
"Give me the tools and I will put New Mexico on a path to progress on allfronts, in all arenas."
"There will be no part of state government, no state problem,no interstate issue that will be ignored because I am not interested in it."
"And that, incidentally, is why I have recommended that my staff be at the samelevel as under the King Administration."
I need a sufficient staff of good peoplewith their attention focused on all these issues and challenges.
"There is much todo, and I need professional people to do a professional job for all of New Mexico."
"I have set forth a path to progress, a path we should begin walking together.I willnot move slowly."
I am already reaching into every corner of government toappoint men and women who share the goals and objectives of the Richardsonadministration.This is not a partisan agenda.
My goals were articulated duringthe campaign.
"As Bob Dylan put it in The Times They Are A Changin , I won’t allowanybody to ""stand in the doorway (or) block up the hall.We won’t be impeded."
We live in New Mexico because we love it.
"I will work and fight together withyou to meet our challenges, to solve our problems and to empower our people.I will provide the leadership.We will succeed."
"We will achieve our goals if wepledge to end the gridlock, set aside partisanship and dedicate ourselves tobuilding a brighter and more prosperous future for all New Mexicans.I am going to work you hard.I promise leadership."
"I promise an agenda for thefuture that will put New Mexico on course to improve our economy, our qualityof life and the well-being of our citizens from every walk of life in everycommunity."
"The partnership for the long haul begins today -- in fact, it has already begun."
Ipledge to work tirelessly with you -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- to charta path for progress for our great state.
"The sun is rising on a new era in New Mexico, even as we turn over the first yearsof a new millennium in an old, old land.The work begins today."
"Let s pledge tobe bold, to be tireless and to never be satisfied with second best."
I ask you all totake the first step with me as we embark on a new path to progress.
