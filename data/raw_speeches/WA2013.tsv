We face fierce and immediate global competition for the jobs of tomorrow.
Leading this next wave of growth is our opportunity, not our entitlement.

We chose to answer this challenge with a unique formula for international success that has made us who we are today: businesses, entrepreneurs, state government, all working together.
Now it’s 24 years later.
I have a new job, a new vantage point, and the world looks much different.
A once-vibrant and growing state economy was brought low by the gross irresponsibility of those on Wall Street.

During the campaign I put out a plan to get Washington back to work that grew to more than 100 points of action.

We must support innovators in these areas with incentives to take risks and bring ideas from dream to reality.

We must also do a better job commercializing the technologies developed in our world-class research institutions, connecting the dots from the classroom to the laboratory to the marketplace.
No economic strategy would be complete without a transportation plan that facilitates this growth.
This session I expect to work with stakeholders who have already committed to a bipartisan plan to build an infrastructure for the next generation.
In the next 10 years, our population will grow by approximately three-quarters of a million people, but we will not be adding one more square inch of dirt.
To honestly address our infrastructure, we have to recognize that creativity is as important as concrete.
I want us to turn our innovative spirit toward crafting a transportation package that includes roads, trains, light rail, buses, bike routes and other modes of transportation.

We will provide efficiency, effectiveness and transparency.
We will introduce performance metrics where it counts, giving us the data we need to fix what’s broken, cut what we don’t need and replace rhetoric with quantifiable results.
But this effort is about more than measurement.
It’s about instituting a culture shift that will endure well beyond my administration.
Moving forward, all state agencies will be rooted in the same three principles: First, we will measure success by the results we produce, not the money we put in.
Second, we will know our customers and what they value.
Third, every agency will adopt a unique process for continual improvement that engages our state employees.

I am serious about reform.
In the weeks to come, I will be taking action to transition to a results- and data-driven government, with continuous quality improvement, employee engagement and clear accountability.
And to honestly address our budget problems, we must admit the difficult truth that the road to a balanced budget and a fully funded educational system runs directly through health care reform.
This means investing in preventive care and aligning incentives with patients to encourage healthy lifestyle choices.
King County is already doing this, and it is working.
We’ll improve the health of all of us in Washington as we move from “sick care” to the true health care system we deserve.
We need to leverage our Medicaid and state employee health systems, and engage providers, carriers and community clinics, to find innovative payment models and health care delivery systems that incentivize quality over quantity.
Effectively implementing the Affordable Care Act will save us money by removing the hidden tax of hundreds of dollars paid monthly by all our state’s insured citizens.
We can do this for the health of our family and the health of our economy.
When we make our health care system more efficient, we lower the cost of doing business in our state.
The states that get this right will have a clear advantage in recruiting and retaining the jobs of tomorrow.
This session, we must make sure Washington gets this right, first.
We must also protect the quality and choice that we expect from a health care system that works.
Washington women need the freedom and privacy to make the health care decisions that are best for themselves and their families.
That’s why I look forward to the Legislature sending the Reproductive Parity Act to my desk, which I will sign.
Let’s get this done.
For Washington to be successful, our economy, our government and our schools must all work together, but before we continue, I want to take a moment to honor the courage and heroism of public school teachers, educators and all our public employees.
The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut showed us all that our nation’s educators put the welfare of their students above everything, even their own lives.
You may have heard the story about the parent who was in the principal’s office when the sounds of gunshots began.
That parent said she ran to get under the nearest desk, as most people would have done, but the educators in the room ran another way.
They ran toward the sound of the gunfire.
They did not return.
It is my fervent hope that the country sees the sacrifices made at this one school, in this one state, as entirely consistent with what teachers and educators do every day, in every school, protect the children in their care.
The tragedy at Sandy Hook was unimaginable, but not unfamiliar.
We have lost too many loved ones in Washington state: in a Seattle café, in Lakewood, at the Seattle Jewish Federation, in a house in Carnation, all victims of a lethal combination of untreated mental illness, evil intent and easy access to deadly weapons.
Any failure to address the issue of violence in our communities and our schools will be intolerable, and in the coming weeks I will work with the Legislature to address this crisis responsibly.
I don’t have all the answers, but I know the sooner we reject the extremes and embrace common sense, the sooner we’ll be able to get a public health solution to this public health problem.
And common sense tells us that this solution will involve mental health and keeping guns out of the wrong hands while respecting the right of my son to hunt and my uncle to defend his home.
All of us have an obligation to provide for the well-being of our families, to ensure their safety and to make sure our children are prepared for the world.
I am proud to live in a state where the education of our children is enshrined as the paramount duty of state government.
I got my start in politics as a concerned parent, when Trudi and I led the effort to fund the construction of a new high school.
I’m inspired by the pockets of excellence I have seen in schools all across Washington.
In Pasco, they improved high school graduation rates through intervention teams they created.
In Renton, they 11 closed achievement gaps with a world-class approach that demands continuous quality improvement in how we educate our children.
I visited TAF Academy where, thanks to a unique public-private partnership, young students are applying the latest technological tools to solve real-world problems.
Across our state we need this kind of real innovation, real reform using proven models and real accountability.
We need to increase the emphasis on STEM education.
Science, technology, engineering and math are just as important to the next generation as the three R’s were to my generation.
They are the essential tools for success in this new economy.
We need to invest more where we get the biggest return, in high-quality early learning programs.
We need a system that aligns from early learning to kindergarten to 12th grade to our universities.
Accountability must be present at every level.
We should continue the progress we are making on improving the teacher and principal evaluation system, and make it a significant part of personnel decisions.
And yes, we need to meet the funding obligations set out by the McCleary decision, but we cannot continue to allow funding debates to mask deeper problems in our schools that demand innovation and reform.
I want us to be able to look our children in the eyes, knowing that we honored our commitment to provide them a world-class education, not through gimmicks or blind allocation of money but through systemic, sustainable reform of our schools.
It’s also critical for us to preserve the leading role our research institutions play in inventing the future, growing our economy and creating jobs.
While we do this, we can no longer accept the misalignment between what our schools teach and what skills our employers need.
This is something I will act on immediately to sharpen the relationship between our schools and the economy they are preparing our young people to enter.
It will be hard work, but it is required work if we want Washington to rise to the challenges the world will present us.
There is no challenge greater for Washington, with more opportunity for job growth and more suited to our particular brand of genius and ingenuity, than leading the world’s clean energy economy.
It is clear to me that we are the right state, at the right time, with the right people.
It’s also clear to me that we face grave and immediate danger if we fail to act.
Nine of 10 of the hottest years on record happened in the past decade.
We’ve had epic flooding, searing drought and devastating wildfires, including last summer’s fires in Central Washington and the rising tides along our coast.
Our Pacific Northwest waters, especially in Puget Sound, are becoming too acidic, forcing parts of our shellfish industry to move last year.
In Eastern Washington, our long tradition in agriculture could be threatened if snowpack declines.
Water stored as snow is money in the bank for Washington’s rural economies, but the bank could fail if we don’t act.
As a parent and a grandparent, I cannot consciously accept the dangers of climate change for my family or yours.
As a Governor, I can’t afford to look the other way or point fingers or deny these realities, and I cannot allow our state to miss the moment we are destined for.
All of us in Washington will have to square up to both our responsibility and our opportunity on climate change, and when we do, I’d like us to remember what Dr. Martin Luther King once said: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
On climate change, we have settled the scientific controversy.
What remains is how we respond to the challenge.
Now I know Washington can’t solve this global problem alone, but we must embrace our role as first responders as our children’s health is in clear and immediate danger.
We must also embrace our role as entrepreneurs and pioneers, ensuring that economic solutions to climate change begin here.
Companies in this state are already moving forward, and we will not hand over our destiny to lead the world in clean energy to any state or to any nation.
We don’t deny science in Washington; we embrace it.
We do not follow technological innovation; we lead it.
And we will not pass up a golden opportunity to create jobs.
We need these clean energy jobs that work for the long haul.
They will be in Bellingham at the Itec solar company, in Seattle at MacDonald-Miller, a great efficiency company, in Spokane at the McKinstry Company and at Boeing where we are making the world’s most fuelefficient jet.
These jobs won’t just fall into our lap.
Washington has what it takes to win, but the clean energy race is highly competitive.
Germany, China and California are not waiting.
Neither should we.
Over the next four years, we need to show our commitment with policies to promote economic growth, research and development on clean energy, to lock in the next wave of growth and opportunity for the next generation.
I look forward to having a real dialogue with the Legislature in the coming weeks on how we best put our ingenuity to work to meet the challenges before us — on creating jobs, educating our children, changing how we do business in state government and creating a culture of leading the world in energy independence.
But as we move forward to determine what we will do, we must also remember who we are as a state.
Washington is a state that embraces all people for who they are.
A state that allows all to love who they will.
A state that is never content with today, but is always leading the world in inventing tomorrow.
A state whose very name commits itself to the preservation of its own beauty for its own grandchildren and its own great-grandchildren.
The Evergreen State.
Thank you.
Now let’s get to work.
