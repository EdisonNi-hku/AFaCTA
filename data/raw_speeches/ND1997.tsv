sentences
Lt. Gov. Rosemarie Myrdal, Majority Leaders Nelson and Dorso, First Lady Nancy, Ladies and Gentleman in the Legislature, Governor Art Link and Grace, and all fellow North Dakotans joining us here in the House Chambers and at home via radio and television.
Good afternoon.
Let me take a moment to ask those who have been elected to the legislature for the first time to stand.
Congratulations and a special welcome to you.
I am deeply honored to stand here today, having earned the trust and faith of the great people of North Dakota to be Governor for a second term.
The anticipation and enthusiasm I feel for the next four years are as intense as they were in December 1992, when I first stepped foot in this office.
As the last Governor of this century, I have been given an incredible opportunity to help guide and shape this state into the next millennium.
I approach this task knowing I am but one member of a great team stretching all across North Dakota.
With the support and help of you the elected representatives of the people, my cabinet and staff, the Lt. Governor, the First Lady, and with the guidance of the Lord, I am confident the next four years will bring growth and prosperity to this state at levels never seen in our history.
One hundred years ago, the pioneers who settled this state were looking with hope, faith and optimism to the next century.
The hearty, aggressive people who tamed our state did so by walking bravely into the prairie winds, determined to survive on their own power and will.
And by the turn of the 20th century, our forefathers were confident about their future.
"Governor F. B. Fancher, in his Inaugural address delivered in 1899 said to the legislators gathered to hear him, ""I congratulate the entire State, on the prosperity which, during the past several years, has blessed our broad domain and rewarded the patience, industry and enterprise of our people."
The suffering of the pioneer has been turned to joy, the struggle with untamed nature has at last borne fruitage.
May a bountiful Providence continue the blessings which we now enjoy.
As Gov. Fancher said, patience, industry and enterprise carried the settlers of our state through difficult times, and as a result, our ancestors were confident that patience, industry and enterprise would produce a more prosperous future.
Obviously, much has changed in North Dakota since then.
But as I look back on the State of our State one hundred years ago, I am struck by the similarities in character and feeling in our state today.
When I took office four years ago, North Dakota was down on its luck.
We had weathered some bad times.
We watched friends and family take their dreams to other places.
We saw people giving up on our state.
The fiery pioneer spirit was only smoldering in the hearts of too many North Dakotans.
But North Dakota is a different place today.
We continue to grow many of the best agricultural products in the world.
But, today in North Dakota giant food processing centers labor and toil on our prairies, turning our crops into finished products like pasta, french fries, premium meats, corn syrup, and bread.
North Dakota is becoming a popular home for international telecommunication-oriented companies -- helping people throughout the nation master computer software problems or make travel arrangements.
Four years ago, we knew diversity was the key to improving North Dakota's economy and positioning our state for a profitable future.
So, working together we made significant changes in some key business factors like workers compensation rates and unemployment taxes.
We put people at the local level in charge of grass roots development, and we gave them some effective tools like PACE and Workforce 2000 to enhance their efforts.
These changes made a difference to prospective businesses.
When ProGold was negotiating with North Dakota and several other states, the initial reforms we implemented in Workers' Compensation gave us a $1.5 million dollar advantage over South Dakota and $5 million over Minnesota.
A HUGE difference that I know was a key factor in ultimately attracting ProGold to our state.
Four years ago in North Dakota we began to dream again.
We called back the courage, determination and spirit of our pioneers to make these dreams a reality.
North Dakota's growth and prosperity has out-paced the most optimistic predictions.
New and expanding businesses created 35,000 new jobs for our people over the past four years, a 12 percent increase.
High-paying manufacturing jobs have increased 17 percent.
Unemployment levels are at record lows.
State revenue collections are at record highs.
And forecasters recently predicted North Dakota's economy to be one of the nation's 10 strongest for the next year.
Stated simply in today's vernacular, North Dakota rocks!
Congratulations to us all.
But I am not here, and you are not here because the job is done.
Yes, we are celebrating today.
But our job .
is to shape tomorrow.
This afternoon, I want to share with you a bold plan for molding our tomorrow.
I see my job, and our mutual challenge, as preparing our state, our employers and our people for the unbridled opportunities that are open to us.
Our pioneer ancestors faced the stiff winds of the prairie .
and succeeded.
But today different winds blow across our fields of waving wheat.
Washington has changed the rules on welfare and agriculture.
The cost of health care has exploded.
International markets are at our door step.
The federal government is providing less resources.
Computers and the Internet make service delivery simpler.
These are the new winds we face in shaping our tomorrow.
As your Governor, I say let us step forward.
Let us marshal our resources.
Let us focus our priorities.
Let us be ready to take advantage of opportunities.
We have recovered from some hard times.
By harnessing the energy of our people and the power of individual endeavor, we have regained the true character of our state.
And now, with this character in hand and confidence in our hearts, we will walk proudly and deliberately into the 21st Century, well prepared and positioned to seize the opportunities of a new era.
"In my first Inaugural address, I said the motto of my administration would be to ""Aim High, and work harder than we thought possible to reach our goals."
That motto holds true today.
If we are to maximize and unlock the full potential of North Dakota, we must be undaunted in our belief in our own ability to prosper.
And we must be unwavering in our efforts to take full advantage of the incredible opportunities before us.
I ask you to work with me in shaping our state.
We must reshape our transportation network if we are to maintain a quality farm-to-market system.
So I will ask that we embark on a mission to prioritize every road in our state system, and determine how it should be maintained.
I will ask that we take the first step toward shifting public health resources from treatment to prevention, so that the eventual cost of health care in this state can be dramatically reduced.
I will ask you to consolidate totally our state's international marketing efforts to give us laser-like focus for both agricultural and manufacturing products in one department.
I asked you in my budget address to totally revamp our welfare program from one of permanent assistance to a temporary safety net for the most needy.
As part of this reform, I ask that we take further steps to make our state and county human service delivery system more efficient.
"I am also going to ask Lt. Governor Myrdal to address you in a few minutes to explain our initiative ""to raise the educational performance bar in North Dakota."
I will ask that we continue efforts to unify and refocus our entire higher education system.
And, I will ask you as members of the legislative assembly to join me in a joint resolution to Congress.
We must implore them to restructure Medicaid to meet the needs of North Dakotans.
AND, we must make it very clear that our state supports a balanced federal budget amendment.
Then, in your spare time, we need you to approve the state budget -- but I ask that it be with NO sales or income tax increase, as it has been for EIGHT STRAIGHT YEARS.
Yes we celebrate today, but as you see, our job.
our real job.
is to shape tomorrow.
Now let's get started.
TRANSPORTATION: We are at a point in North Dakota where we must face the reality of our transportation infrastructure.
We have more miles of roads per capita than any other state in the nation: a total of 107,000 miles.
That's 1 mile for every six people in the state.
We simply can not afford this immense system.
Several factors are converging in North Dakota to place our transportation infrastructure in jeopardy today.
All states rely heavily upon the federal government for money to maintain road systems.
In North Dakota, 50 percent of our budget for road construction and maintenance is federal funds.
However, the federal highway bill is currently undergoing massive changes, and although the full outcome is not yet known, we can be quite certain reduced funding is inevitable.
State funding for road construction and maintenance comes from two sources: the state gas tax and motor vehicle licensing.
While traffic is increasing and loads are much heavier, gas tax revenues remain stagnant because today's more fuel efficient vehicles use a lot less gas!
Improved industry and commerce, increases in manufacturing activity, and new value-added processing centers are putting additional pressure on our roadways.
-- It's a price of progress, and it also underscores the importance of a solid transportation infrastructure.
For this reason, I am directing our Department of Transportation to work with cities and counties to analyze our statewide transportation system, road by road.
We must, as a state, start discussing which roads are essential to our infrastructure.
This will not be an easy process.
However, we can not afford to jeopardize our entire system in order to avoid difficult decisions about priorities and needs.
Citizens throughout the state should join in these efforts.
Contribute your ideas and concerns constructively.
Together we must design a transportation system for the future that is smooth and efficient and will never be a road block to prosperity.
PUBLIC HEALTH: In the face of sweeping changes in health care delivery and insurance, we should re-assess our public health system and make sure we are channeling appropriate resources toward prevention and maintenance of good health in our people.
Our current system has served us fairly well, but it is loosely coordinated, duplicative and horribly expensive.
Studies prove that public health initiatives are the primary reason people live longer today than in the past.
Improved sanitation, immunization, contagion control, and other prevention efforts have done more to increase human life span than all of today's impressive medical advancements.
I am asking the Health Department to develop a strategic plan for the future of public health in North Dakota.
We will involve local health units, health care providers, academic institutions and the public to construct a coordinated approach for promoting long-term health and wellness in our citizens as no other state is doing.
North Dakota has an opportunity to be a national model for proactive public health programming.
And, in the process we can dramatically improve the quality of life for our people and reduce the rising cost of medical care and treatment.
Diabetes is a good example.
As a state, we have one of the highest rates of diabetes in the country.
Seventeen percent of North Dakotans have or will develop this disease.
Nationally, diabetes and its side effects account for 27 percent of Medicare costs.
Yet we know that through proper diet, exercise and good living habits, the devastating affects of diabetes can be greatly reduced.
Statistics about prevention are humbling.
Lifestyle changes - limiting stress, exercising regularly and eating right -- can improve our chances of avoiding premature death by 50 percent.
In comparison, better access to health care improves life span by only 10 percent.
The importance of lifestyle cannot be overemphasized.
Every day we make decisions about what to eat, how to prioritize our time, whether or not to wear seatbelts.
All of these decisions contribute greatly to our individual health and quality of life.
We have an excellent quality of life in our state, but each one of us can make it better.
North Dakotans take good care of each other.
It's time for us to take better care of ourselves, and instill positive health habits in our children.
United Hospital in Grand Forks has developed a creative incentive program for school children to encourage good fitness.
This fall, I joined students and teachers at Kelly Elementary School in Grand Forks as they reached their goal of walking 12,300 miles in six weeks.
As a reward, United Hospital gave the school $500 to use for physical education programming.
It was amazing to think that those hundreds of little legs really walked that far.
The students learned three valuable lessons: that exercise doesn't have to be hard, but it does have to be regular and it can be fun and very rewarding!
I will not be leading legislators on a run around the capitol as I am prone to do myself during the noon hour.
But I will offer to communities around this state my help and participation in your efforts to promote fitness and well being.
INTERNATIONAL: If we are to unlock the full potential of our state, North Dakotans must actively and aggressively begin competing in national and international markets.
"Whether you produce snowmobile parts in Dickinson, wood spindles in Chaffee or animation studio services in Minot, business owners need to ask, ""Who are my customers, and how can I expand and get more customers far beyond the borders of North Dakota and North America?"""
I ran for governor because I wanted to bring more business principles and ideas to this office.
Let me share one such experience with you now.
You may have heard this story before, but it illustrates my point well and bears repeating.
When my father Harold Schafer was 20 he began concocting cleaning potions in his basement -- not unlike many entrepreneurs whom I have met in North Dakota.
He began selling his products door-to-door in Bismarck, and slowly realized that if people in Bismarck liked it so should people in Fargo, and Minneapolis, and Los Angeles.
What started as a small enterprise with one homegrown product sold locally, grew to a diverse company whose North Dakota sales comprised just a small fraction of total business.
I say this not to downplay the importance of North Dakota markets, but to emphasize the incredible potential of customers and markets outside our state.
We can sell products from a basement in New Rockford, to New York, New Delhi or New Guinea.
The information age is liberating the consumer.
Telecommunications is shifting power to consumers on a grand scale.
And I believe the information age, if we allow technology to empower the individual citizen, will be stunning in the number of opportunities it can provide.
In a rural state like North Dakota, technology eliminates many of the geographical and environmental barriers facing our small communities.
We must work vigorously to maximize the benefits and potential of new technology.
Private industry must have the incentives and returns on investment necessary to make costly high-tech investments in our state.
As the 1996 Telecommunications Act becomes a reality, our state's legislative and regulatory bodies should guide the development of our technology infrastructure.
As we look to the future, we must develop businesses in North Dakota that produce for national and international markets.
And the state can play a role in stimulating these efforts.
The International Trade Program in the Economic Development and Finance Agency already provides exporting assistance to North Dakota businesses.
However, I believe it is time to bring these efforts to the forefront, to update and enhance our trade assistance programs and help North Dakotans share in the wealth of the global marketplace.
Many North Dakota businesses do not have the resources or expertise for exporting.
We will begin working with the banking community to assess the need for an export finance program in the Bank of North Dakota.
An export finance expert who is well-versed in private, state, federal and international financing options could counsel our companies, and provide working capital loans and loan guarantees to support their exporting efforts.
This investment would easily pay for itself in returns to the state.
We need to make the exporting process as easy as possible for all North Dakota business people, whether they grow wheat or build furniture.
The design of our current trade assistance programs is cumbersome.
We actually have two programs: the International Trade program in ED&F for manufactured and processed goods, and a separate agriculture program in the Ag Department.
During this legislative session, we could combine the two departments into one in the Economic Development agency to better focus our international efforts.
Merging two divisions with the same purpose provides one-stop shopping for clients, reduces duplication in programming, leverages staff expertise and financial resources, and lends more continuity to policies and priorities.
One coordinated program would eliminate confusion and give all farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, processors and service providers access to the same opportunities.
Agriculture is no longer a separate economy in North Dakota.
Farmers and ranchers are assuming more risk.
They are investing in value-added processing ventures, and their interests and concerns mirror those of manufacturers.
In today's agriculture economy, we should provide our producers the best available expertise on technical issues, marketing, trade and financing.
This expertise already exists in the Economic Development and Finance Agency.
We ought to house all our trade efforts as well as Pride of Dakota and APUC in that agency to provide the broadest, most convenient service to business people, especially farmers and ranchers.
Many other states have already made this change with great success.
It is sensible and efficient and North Dakota should take this next logical step.
EDUCATION: Last spring, about the same time as the Statewide Education Summit, the Fargo Forum ran a special education supplement, written and designed by students.
The ideas and observations of the students were quite impressive, but one stands out in my mind.
Little Lauren Laughlin, then a second grader at Fargo's Lewis and Clark elementary school, wrote about storm days but her message went far beyond her subject and her years of observation.
"She said, ""I think we should start making up storm days."
Then we can learn more stuff.
If we don't learn enough in school, we won't know enough in our job.
We need to do this to make a better state.
Lauren was right.
We have a strong education system in North Dakota.
Our students rank very high against others throughout the nation.
But we can't let these accomplishments hypnotize us into complacency.
We should heed the words of a seven-year-old.
We must challenge our students more.
"In my budget address, I announced a new initiative called the ""Myrdal Fund for Excellence,"" named after Lt. Gov. Rosemarie Myrdal who developed the idea."
During our frequent discussions about school funding, Rosemarie emphasizes quality which, she bravely points out, is not always improved by more money alone.
A teacher herself for many years, I have come to deeply trust Rosemarie's counsel and insight on education.
I asked her to join me in this State of the State message to tell North Dakotans about this important new initiative and focus for our state's K-12 education system.
"""THE MYRDAL FUND FOR EXCELLENCE"" Good afternoon."
Thank you Ed for inviting me to participate in this historic speech.
I probably won't be as exciting as the telemedicine demonstration when we got to look in the Governor's ear, but I'll do my best!
"Frequently, when legislators, school board members or even parents evaluate education programs, the question they ask is, ""How does this reach the kids?"""
"or ""How much of this money goes directly into the classroom?"""
These are important questions and worthy goals.
I was a school board member, a legislator and a parent myself, and I asked these same questions.
But today I believe we as a state need to sharpen our focus.
If we are really going to add value to our education system, if we really want to give our children the best schooling available, we must enhance the skills and tools of our teachers.
Teachers are the most important piece of the learning process.
To be effective in teaching children today, our teachers must be technologically skilled and equipped with interesting and dynamic teaching materials.
And, they must be totally focused on well-defined goals and objectives for their students.
"The ""Myrdal Fund for Excellence"" is centered on teachers and aimed at improving instruction in our schools."
First, we must develop K-12 education content standards and assessments methods.
With the Internet and other high-tech advancements, knowledge in the world is multiplying at inconceivable rates.
This environment implores us to define what, out of the millions of megabytes of information, what MUST our children learn?
In almost every profession, organization or business in our society, standards are considered a good thing.
Electricians, accountants, engineers, lawyers, doctors all have high standards.
"When we hear that someone or someplace has ""high"" standards we think, ""Great!"""
and we feel confident and reassured.
But somehow, applying standards to education is, in the minds of some people, ill-conceived, threatening or unnecessary.
I hope we can get beyond this in North Dakota.
"This proposal to establish standards is not an exercise in social engineering; it is not an effort to produce ""cookie cutter"" children; nor is it an attempt to control the destiny of all our youth."
Our goal for North Dakota is to adopt world-class academic standards to give all our children a world-class foundation for their future.
We must also strategically integrate technology into the classroom and use it effectively to support our standards and goals.
Multimedia, computer simulation, virtual reality and other new teaching tools will dramatically enhance classrooms of the future.
But in a state with limited funds like North Dakota, school districts can not afford to make costly mistakes in their technology investments.
The state ought to provide leadership in this area.
Keeping abreast of technology developments, the state can guide local school districts toward wise purchases.
We can also provide ideas for integrating technology into the classroom.
The state should make available standards, assessments and technology recommendations to local school districts as a guide, not a mandate, for curriculum development.
And, for those districts interested, we can provide training and professional development to the teachers who are ultimately responsible for educating our children.
The bulk of this work will be performed by a nine-member Standards and Technology Task Force that will include representatives from DPI, the Governor's Office, the Legislature, education, business and parents.
They will report to the 1999 legislature on the status of standards and technology in achieving K-12 education excellence in North Dakota.
We have a teacher in our midst today who is already intimately involved in this very work on the local level.
Sam Johnson is a high school teacher in Devils Lake.
He is the librarian, he runs the school's multi-media center, and he is responsible for training teachers to use technology and other resources effectively in the classroom.
"Sam also teaches several classes of the future, including one called ""Global Connections."
As you can see, Sam wears many hats in his school, and does it all well.
Not surprisingly, Sam is the North Dakota Education Association's Teacher of the Year for 1996-97.
Sam, it is with great pleasure that I ask you to stand up and be recognized today.
My hope is that schools and teachers throughout North Dakota, urban and rural, will have access to solid resources and training at the cutting-edge of their profession, much like Sam Johnson brings to his school.
This is the direction we must go in North Dakota, to be the BEST we can be and to challenge our teachers and students to new levels of achievement.
Thank you.
HIGHER EDUCATION: Thank you Rosemarie.
"I join you in your enthusiasm for this project and look forward to implementing the ""Myrdal Fund for Excellence."
Our state's University System is another area where we must target our resources and employ the goal of being the best we can be.
I commend the University System and Chancellor Larry Isaak for beginning to answer the call to unify and refocus.
We are taking some critical steps to realign the system, to make it healthy and lean, nimble enough to adjust to new opportunities yet stable and strong in the basics.
The University System deleted nearly 90 under-utilized, outdated or redundant programs.
And, they recently developed a common system-wide academic calendar and a single, uniform application for all the institutions.
North Dakota was the first state to employ the Interactive Video System effectively.
Let us now push this and other technology to its limits and bring the best of each campus - whether it is an MBA program at UND or a nursing program at Wahpeton - to citizens throughout the state, from Mott to Minto.
North Dakotans will someday be able to tap into the best education and training available in other states as well through the Western Governors' University.
Our citizens will be able to design their own academic program, selecting from top-ranked courses at a variety of western universities taught through the mail or on Internet or Interactive Video.
WGU is a bold new approach to education that has great potential for our citizens.
I support the University System's request for greater flexibility and freedom to manage the system.
The Board of Higher Education should have intimate knowledge and understanding of the University System, and is the proper entity to provide long-term vision for higher education in North Dakota.
In exchange for this flexibility, the board will be held accountable for the health of the System.
They will need to provide specific information to me and the legislature about the priorities and goals they set.
And they must demonstrate progress toward achieving these goals and a detailed accounting of how state money is being spent.
Citizens are calling for changes.
Legislators are calling for changes.
The health of the system demands changes.
The opportune time is here.
We must remodel our University System to make it the best it can be for the future generations of North Dakota people who will depend on it.
CONCLUSION: The agenda I have outlined for us is aggressive.
You have much to do in considering this and many other issues.
But let us pause to once again remember how much we have to celebrate in our state.
There is a renewed spirit in North Dakota.
We are on the verge of moving into the next century with more jobs, more revenues and more opportunities.
Let us remember that the greatest growth period in our history was from 1900 to 1910, and let us prepare to encourage our people to reach even new heights in the beginning of the next century.
Last week, I was reading an editorial from a major North Dakota newspaper.
The writer suggested we didn't know much about welfare reform and encouraged the state to match the reforms in Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Interestingly, when we look at the true picture, North Dakota is already ahead of these states and others in many ways.
Their people are calling North Dakota to learn how we do it!
The message here is we don't get the headlines or the publicity like larger states.
In North Dakota, we just get the job done.
And our programs are every bit as good as theirs right now.
Fortunately, my friend Governor Link who is here today counseled me long ago to never govern by editorial.
And I want every North Dakotan to know, to believe that we are the best at what we do.
We have unlimited potential and have every reason to believe that we can achieve even our best dreams.
Two years ago when I was preparing for the State of the State address, I took a walk around the Capitol Mall and reflected to you what I saw.
I saw the great plains Indians and their environmental wisdom and culture.
I saw our veterans fighting for democracy and freedom.
I saw our children laughing, singing and leaping for joy.
"Last night I made that same walk and this time I saw - snow, and cold… And I thought, ""Why did people settle here?"""
Because they believed they could make a better life and a stronger future.
I believe the greatest gifts government can bestow on its citizens are opportunity, independence and hope.
Think of that when you come to the Capitol, take a look at the pioneer family that greets us every day and remember, we are the pioneers of the 21st Century, forging a pathway of education, health and safety for our citizens so they can pursue their dreams.
In conclusion, let me read from the Bible, the Book of Jeremiah, chapter 29, verse 11.
"""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord."
Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.
Plans to give you love and a future.
As the pioneers of today, we remember the pioneers of the past.
See them huddled together, fiercely independent, firmly believing in God's promise to them and in their own ability to carve out a better future.
They represent progress and spirit.
Our job today is to offer opportunity to the people of this state, to cultivate and nurture that spirit of progress, independence and optimism of our pioneers.
And, our job is to lend a helping hand to those who need it, a helping hand from family, a friend, a neighbor, our government.
Be prepared to offer a warm blanket of comfort.
This is our job.
This is our mission.
So, as we celebrate today, we must never forget our obligation to shape tomorrow.
Thank you, and God speed in your work.
