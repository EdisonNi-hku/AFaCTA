SENTENCES
"President Scott, Speaker Wallace, members of the Supreme Court, my partner Buddy MacKay, members of the Cabinet, members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, my fellow Floridians: We come together this morning as the elected leaders of the fourth largest of the 50 United States."
We come as representatives of 14 million people who call Florida home.
I know you share my concern about the lack of credibility that elected office holders hold with the people.
"Most polls today show that if voters could, they would vote for ""that someone other than the above named candidates."
I believe that is because they've become disillusioned with our game-playing and partisan bickering.We can change that.
"A book was recently published called ""A New History of Florida."
It ends about where we begin -- identifying the great challenges we face this session.
History shows us that we always have a choice.
"We can allow events to shape us, or we can choose to shape events."
"The 2,000 bills you will consider this session are the raw material of tomorrow's history."
How will Florida's children judge our work when our chapter is written?
I hope they'll look back on 1996 as the year cooperation replaced confrontation and results replaced rhetoric.Let that be our legacy.
We are a state with great assets.
"We have a diverse population, a growing economy and rich natural resources."
"But, our state also has tremendous needs."
I want to talk to you today about some challenges we face this session.
* We must continue to reduce crime and violence.
* We must provide our children with a future full of hope -- including a quality education.
* And we must take the necessary steps to strengthen and improve our economy.
CRIME Let me begin today by recognizing the dedicated work of our state's law enforcement officers.
These heroes put their lives on the line every day -- protecting and serving our people with distinction.
"Over the past five years, we've taken strong action together to help law enforcement promote safer streets and communities for our people."
"* Since 1991, we've added nearly 38,000 prison beds -- and we've increased the time inmates serve from 33 to 85 percent."
* We've ENDED early release as a way to control prison overcrowding.
We've sent a clear message that we won't allow criminals to terrorize our people.
"In Florida now, if you do the crime you will do the time."
"Now, we need correctional officers and security improvements to handle the increased capacity of our prisons."
One of our biggest challenges is dealing with juvenile delinquents.
"When it came to leading our charge to reform juvenile justice, I asked one of our state's most accomplished law enforcement officers, Calvin Ross, to help us."
We're providing the deep end slots for the habitually violent juvenile.
Now we must provide the funding for the prevention and intervention -- to prevent developing another crop of incorrigible kids.
"If you look at the profile of our prison inmates, you'll see they got on the wrong path at an early age."
* they came from broken homes; * lack basic educational skills; * dropped out of school; * abused alcohol or drugs; and * many were victims of abuse.
"If we don't change the profile, we won't change the results."
We know that we'll never be able to build enough prisons to handle our crime problem if we don't do something about our children on the front end.
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES My priority for the next three years -- will be protecting Florida's most precious natural resource: children and families.
A recent poll by the Tampa Tribune and the Florida Center for Children and Youth shows us the people are way ahead of us.
It shows the public wants us to focus on children and families.
Our people are most concerned about the education of our children.
"I applaud Speaker Wallace, President Scott and the members of the House and Senate for making that your top priority for this session, too."
EDUCATION We all know the doorway to prosperity is education.
"If Florida is ever to grow and thrive, the majority of our kids must get over the threshold."
"We have focused on the back end, and we had to because that's where our failures were."
"But, like crime, unless we look at our children from birth; nurturing and developing their capacity so they come to grammar school safe and sound -- prepared to learn -- they will never succeed."
"Helping children at three and four years old, when they are in pre-kindergarten, has proved to be an effective and economically sound strategy to prepare the disadvantaged child for success in school."
"137,000 of our kids need this kind of boost."
"We don't want to hear about the bad scores our children get, but we have failed to fund textbooks and materials to keep them supplied with current tools."
Textbooks and computers are critical educational tools.
But half our teachers say their students have to share books and many can't take books home to study.
And many of the books our kids do have are outdated.
Kids in Dade County showed me some of the textbooks they were using.
* Take a look at this history book.
Ronald Reagan is still President.
Not one word in it about democracy's triumph over communism.
"The Soviet Union is still the ""Evil Empire."
Not one word about the Gulf War or President Bush or Clinton.
* And this Biology book doesn't even mention a disease called AIDS.We can do better.
Florida must make a commitment to the most basic kind of education reform -- providing textbooks and resource materials to children in the classroom.
SAFE SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS Kids need safe schools.
Let's increase the number of Second Chance Schools to remove disruptive and dangerous students from our regular classrooms.
We all shared the agony of the Ryce family when their son Jimmy was abducted and killed.
That tragedy reminds us that it is everyone's responsibility to protect our children.
"In Jimmy's memory, let's enact a Jimmy Ryce Child Safety Law and send a strong message that our children can walk home in safety."
Protecting and preserving the family unit is critical in all our efforts to move Florida forward.
That why we must redouble our effort to ensure our children's homes are safe havens.
You have helped make Florida a bellwether state in the effort to address domestic and sexual violence.
Let's continue our leadership role.
We must continue to require that fathers embrace their responsibilities and support the children they've helped bring into the world.
A GOOD START FOR CHILDREN We've made good progress in addressing the needs of our children.
"Today, our infant mortality rate is at its lowest point ever."
We've had a 23 percent drop since 1990.
"That means more than 1,100 babies are alive today because of our efforts to promote smart prevention programs like Healthy Start."
Thousands more will be able to go through life healthy and without a disability because their mothers went to full term.
That helps lift a great weight off of our taxpayers.
And we've taken our immunization rate from 63 percent to 80 percent.
That's a 27 percent increase since 1991.
The number of children in foster care is down and our adoptions are up by 80 percent since 1990.But we still have a way to go.
I had the pleasure of being escorted to the chamber this morning by three foster children waiting to be adopted.
"We need to find loving parents for all our 1,700 kids in foster care who are adoptable."
"I'm proud my daughter, Rhea McKinnon, is spearheading our Partnership for Adoption effort."
She is working to enlist the help of our corporate citizens in placing these kids for adoption.
My daughter had a pretty good role model.
"I am lucky to have the best friend of Florida's children and families as my top advisor, my inspiration and as the love of my life."
Rhea always has been a strong advocate promoting the needs of our youngest citizens.
"Recently, she told me ""You better do something about children and families."
You've only got three years left.
"If you don't do something, everything that you've been working on could end.So I hit the road."
I've been traveling the state learning first hand about what's happening in our communities.
I've seen many successful programs and have been honored to hear some of the participants share their personal stories with me.
"In Daytona Beach, I met Carrie Stebbins."
Carrie got pregnant when she was only 17 and had to quit school before finishing High School.
She wanted to finish school but couldn't because there was no one to watch her baby while she was in class.
Carrie got help from Teen Parent East.
The program provided bus transportation and child care for her baby while she attended school.
"Last June, Carrie graduated from high school and is now attending community college and is working as a volunteer at Teen Parent East -- showing other girls that they can make it, too."
"In Naples, I met Sherrie Ode, a 23-year-old single mother of two little boys."
Sherrie is getting job training -- training that will help make life better for her family.
Her dream is to become a lawyer.
Florida has some great programs working for our children.
These programs matter -- they make a difference.
They just don't cover enough of our children's needs.
I guarantee each of you that if you go back home and spend just half a day really looking at these programs -- what they do and what they need -- you will become even more determined to help.
Ask T. Wayne Davis of Winn Dixie and the people at Pratt and Whitney if focusing on kids can help the bottom line.
Ask Dominic Calabro of Florida TaxWatch if investing in our children is smart fiscal policy.
"They each will tell you that it makes good sense -- good economic sense and common sense, too."
"HEALTHY KIDS Now, I would like to ask for the indulgence of the Republican members for a moment."
I'd like to say a few words to my fellow Democrats in the chamber today.
"Back in 1990, Senator ""Doc"" Myers and Representative Fred Lippman joined a strong, bi-partisan effort to establish the Healthy Kids program."
Governor Martinez and Treasurer Tom Gallagher were good stewards of this program.
Healthy Kids is one of the most successful prevention programs we have.
It provides access to health care for uninsured children who would otherwise wind up in the emergency room.
"Since Healthy Kids began, more than 16,000 children have received low-cost, comprehensive health care coverage."
"By next year, more than 23,000 kids will be enrolled in 12 counties."
Every evaluation shows this has been an outstanding bottom- line success.
Healthy Kids is a lifeline to children who need it.
"For only $33 million we can provide coverage for 111,000 uninsured children."
"Fellow Democrats, I know this is tough."
"But, I urge you to continue this good, smart and sound Republican idea started by Doc Myers, Tom Gallagher and Bob Martinez."
Florida's Healthy Kids program has been a remarkable success and we can make it even better.
This is not about who gets the credit -- it's about caring for our kids.
A sick kid can't be a smart kid.
ELDERS We can't talk about strengthening families without mentioning our elders.
"Last year, this Legislature took appropriate action to bolster our elder abuse laws."
The people thank you for your effort.
We owe our elders a real commitment to a quality of life that includes basic human dignity and care in a better alternative to a nursing home.
Let's ensure their golden years do not become tarnished times.
A STRONG ECONOMY We know good jobs and the economic security and promise they bring to our people is a critical building block for stronger families.We have good news to tell.
"* Last year -- with 200,000 new jobs -- we were a national leader in job creation."
* Our tourism base is strong and 1995 was Florida's best year ever.
* International trade has been increasing by double digits since 1991 and Florida is fast becoming the international hub for South America.
Our efforts to reach consensus on Enterprise Florida can be a model for the rest of the nation.
"It's yet another example that we can work together -- public and private sector, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate."
We've proven that we can rise above our differences for the common good.
"Enterprise Florida will help us build a world-class economy by looking out for rural, urban and minority needs."
The House worked hard on a bill last year and now the Senate has joined.
"We have bi-partisan, bi-cameral support in a great spirit of cooperation."
"Senators McKay, Dantzler and President Scott -- thank you for your hard work."
"Representatives Lippman, Bloom, Mackey, Miller, Safley, Bitner, Merchant, Warner and Speaker Wallace -- I appreciate your efforts, too."
When you pass this landmark bill -- and I sign it into law -- we'll send the strong message to businesses across the world that Florida is ready for prime time.
Let's make this our first order of business and close the deal.
WELFARE REFORM We can't have meaningful economic development without meaningful welfare reform.
For too long we've just handed people money -- without offering them any hope of escaping the welfare trap.
Our Work First plan rewards work over welfare.
"It replaces dependence with the independence, pride and personal responsibility that a job provides."
Work First turns welfare applications into job applications.
We are sending a clear message that there are no free rides.
From our successful Escambia and Alachua Family Transition Program pilots we've learned that we must provide child care and health care.
These programs also show you can't have successful welfare reform and save money in the first few years.
"But, we will reap huge future savings if we make these changes."
"I've requested an additional $60 million to provide child care services to 18,000 children -- that's critical to welfare reform."
I'm pleased to see Senator Toni Jennings and the members of the Senate and Representative Scott Clemons and Representative Mary Brennan and the House are moving on parallel tracks.
Let's make this another bi-partisan success for Florida.
RULES AND REGULATIONS Last year I called for a 50 percent reduction in rules and regulations.
"My partner, Buddy MacKay tells me we are more than halfway toward our goal."
But we have more to do and we need your help.
A number of proposals before you allow agencies to reduce rules.
The Department of Business and Professional Regulation is proposing to deregulate some professions so they can focus on regulating professions with significant impact on public health and safety.
I urge you to support that good effort.
I've identified more than 30 boards which add nothing to the necessary functions of government.I ask you to repeal them.
"More broadly, I ask you to enact laws with clear policy direction, so there is no need to set policy through the rulemaking processes."
"If we can't justify the ""red tape"" -- let's get rid of it."
I'm also committed to the reform of the Administrative Procedures Act.
"Thanks to the APA Review Commission, we have a proposal that simplifies the APA, increases flexibility in the application of administrative rules, and increases agency accountability to the legislature and the general public."
Let's pass this important legislation.
ENVIRONMENT Protecting our environment also is critical to enhancing Florida's quality of life.
"With our strong commitment to the environment, our air and water are cleaner now than 10 years ago."
Preservation 2000 has made us a leader in environmental protection.
"Since P-2000 was enacted in 1990, we've placed more than 600,000 acres of irreplaceable natural areas aside for future generations."
Our budget calls for $300 million for P-2000 and $10 million in funding for SWIM to continue our strong efforts in environmental protection.
STATE EMPLOYEES It's our responsibility to provide our taxpayers with effective government services.
We have one of the most efficiently run state governments in the nation -- producing results for our people.
"Florida has some of the hardest working state employees in America -- and some of the lowest paid, too."
"During this session let's provide a three percent pay increase for our state employees with a $1,000 minimum."
We need to change a situation where the same employees who hand out food stamps also have to live on them.
TOBACCO I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about our Tobacco Liability Law.
"John Stennis, United States Senator from Mississippi, was a man for whom I had the deepest respect."
One day we were talking about hard votes.
"He told me that when he first came to the Senate, Senator Richard Russell, of Georgia, told him, ""John, once in a while you have to cast a vote for your country.I had several of those votes."
"You have one coming up -- the ""Tobacco Override"".It's a hard vote."
The tobacco companies have hired two lobbyists for every member of the Senate.
"The smoke screen argument is this, ""The bill is so broad -- any business could be sued.Heifer Dust."
"No other product, other than tobacco, kills and maims when used as directed."
And the state must prove fault and injury.
"In order to remove any credibility to this argument, I have, by Executive Order and Court Stipulation, narrowed the use of the act only to tobacco."
"And I, support legislation to narrow the suit to tobacco."
"Each year more than 28,000 Floridians die from the effects of smoking.That's one every 19 minutes."
"That's three of your neighbors every hour, every day, every year."
Money collected from our taxpayers in the amount of $420 million is spent by the state every year to cover deaths and damages caused by tobacco.
"Nearly 64,000 Florida kids are hooked by tobacco every year."
That's one Florida child falling into tobacco's deadly trap every 9 minutes.
It's our responsibility to protect them.
This is one of those watershed votes.
Tobacco's time of getting away with this is running out.
Make this a vote of conscience and put Florida in the vanguard of making tobacco pay for the damage it has caused.
Show Floridians that powerful lobbyists and big campaign contributions cannot persuade you against the bigger interest of the public.
Join me in the fight FOR our taxpayers and AGAINST tobacco.
Thank you Mr. Speaker for your stand today.
"COOPERATION Every day in Florida, we have the chance to literally change the history of our nation.We have a very strong voice."
I'd like to share with you my recent experiences with five other governors who conferred about the funding of Medicaid.
There were three Democrats -- Roy Roemer of Colorado and Bob Miller of Nevada and me.
"And there were three Republicans - - Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, John Engler of Michigan and Mike Levitt of Utah."
"We represented ""no growth"", ""slow growth"" and ""fast growth"" states."
We also represented very diverse and strongly held views about how the Federal government should handle the Medicaid program.
"With major philosophic and demographic differences between us, we were given the monumental task of coming to an agreement which we could recommend to ALL governors."
Our first two meetings were a disaster.
Each of us got up and walked out at least once.
"And when we were ready to call it a hopeless task and report failure, Tommy Thompson, our chairman, urged us to persist."
he said we HAD to come back and try again.We did.
We started looking for areas of agreement.
Then we addressed the major differences that each party and each state brought to the table.We gave and we got.
I wanted to ensure Florida was protected.
Three meetings later we agreed on an outline which subsequently became the plan that the governors of all 50 states endorsed at the NGA meeting in Washington -- with a standing ovation.
There also was a unanimous agreement on a plan to reform the national welfare system.
We six governors spent more than 100 hours with each other in deliberation.
The bi-partisan approach worked.
How was it that Governors could reach agreement when the Congress and the President could not?We had an imperative.
"You know, Florida had a heck of a lot at stake."
In the first Congressional plan we lost $8 billion.
In the vetoed plan we lost about $4 billion.
In the Governors' Plan -- Florida will not get hurt.
"Because each of our states would be so vitally affected, we HAD to find a solution."
"This process was a great lesson for me -- and I hold it out to you as a way that, together, we can address the thorny problems we MUST solve for the people of Florida."
"I will meet with you anytime, for as long as is needed to work out our differences."
NEW PARTNERSHIP Let's show the voters who put us here that we've replaced partisanship with partnership.
Let's use these next 60 days to show we can work together.
Let's see our future through the eyes of all our children.
"Let's make a strong commitment to help them reach their full potential.We can begin, today.Right here, right now."
Let's stand together as Floridians and write a new chapter of our state's history.
Let's draw strength from our diversity to boldly move forward into an era of cooperation.Floridians are a great people.And we can be even greater.
Florida's children are our inspiration to do what is right.
They are our inspiration to face the challenges of our times.They deserve our best effort.
Let's take action that will make all our future generations proud.
Let us work together -- as Floridians -- and provide our children with a future full of opportunity .Thank you.
