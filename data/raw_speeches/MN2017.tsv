Now, as I approach the end of my career in public service, with two years remaining in this, my final term, as Governor, I am especially grateful for all of the remarkable people I have met in Minnesota.
The teachers, who dedicate their lives to helping struggling children.
The heroic law enforcement officers, who courageously risk their lives to protect our lives.
The hard-working public employees, who serve the rest of us well, and seldom get credit for doing so.
The talented businessmen and women, who drive our economy and provide us with jobs.
The skilled workers, who make those jobs work for a Better Minnesota.
The amazing farmers, doctors, nurses, firefighters, and so many others, who make ours the best state in the nation.
I thank you.
In 2010, I campaigned for Governor on the promise of a Better Minnesota.
Now, and two years from now, I expect to be judged by you, the people of Minnesota, on how well I have kept that promise.
In my first Inaugural Address, I said that my top priority was to bring more jobs to our state.
When I took office in 2011, there were 202,000 Minnesotans unemployed.
Since then, our growing businesses have added 255,400 jobs.
Our state's unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for the past 30 months.
And there are more jobs in Minnesota now than ever before.
Nevertheless, these past six years have been very difficult for many of our citizens.
The Great Recession has had severe and lasting effects.
The new world economy doesn’t look like the old one, and it doesn’t treat many Minnesotans as well.
Inflation-adjusted, real household income in Minnesota averages $68,730 today, which is 22 percent above the national average.
However, it is 8 percent less than it was at the turn of the century.
To repeat, the average Minnesota family is relatively poorer than sixteen years ago.
The US economy, which from 1970 until 2007 grew at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent, real GDP, is now “recovering” from the Great Recession at a much slower pace.
Real GDP is now projected to grow by only 2.2 percent annually for the foreseeable future.
A slow growth economy with declining real incomes, foreshadows a very uncertain future for many Minnesotans and other Americans.
Compounding those uncertainties are the ever-widening gaps between people, who have too little and those, who have so much.
From 2007 to 2015, the average real incomes of the richest 20 percent of Minnesotans increased.
The average real incomes for everyone else fell.
And the incomes of the wealthiest 5 percent increased the most of anyone.
That drop in share of income affects the bedrock of our society, the middle-class.
It’s not just that the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.
Our middle-class is getting poorer, too.
For many of Minnesota's hard-working men and women, their lives are more difficult and uncertain than before the previous recession; or for Minnesota’s farmers and miners, the current recession.
Many have to work longer hours to make less money; and many others, who have good-paying jobs, worry that they might lose them.
Health insurance premiums cost more, and often cover less.
Retirement incomes are more inadequate and less reliable.
Too many Minnesotans no longer believe that their own futures will be better, and that their children will live even better lives.
We cannot entirely escape the ups and downs of the U. S. economy.
However, in the past, we have often suffered lesser downturns during national recessions, and achieved faster recoveries, when conditions improve.
If our country is going to be mired in an era of slower economic growth, our public investments must be even more targeted to ensure that our state's economic performance remains superior to most other states.
Thus, we should look closely at every budget expenditure and policy decision, and ask two questions: What will they do to help hard-working Minnesotans now?
And how will they help our children and grandchildren in the years ahead?The answers to those two questions should shape our priorities in this Legislative Session.
Our first priority, for it is the foundation of a successful future, must be to ensure our state government's continued fiscal integrity and budget security, which I promised to restore when I became Governor in 2011.
Back then, state government faced a projected $6 billion deficit in the next biennium, with still more deficits predicted thereafter.
"In my first Inaugural Address, I promised that I would ""clean up the state's financial mess."
I have kept my word.
We have turned that first $6 billion projected deficit into $1.4 billion projected surpluses for each of the next two bienniums.
To get here, we first had to repay the $2.8 billion owed our school districts; then repay previous raids on the Airport Fund, the Doug Johnson Fund, and the Solid Waste Landfill Fund.
We eliminated other shifts and gimmicks.
And we set aside parts of our most recent surpluses to establish a $2 billion Budgeted Reserve Fund that will help protect our state's finances during future economic downturns.
As one result, The Fitch Rating Agency recently increased our bond rating to Triple A.
The budget I will propose tomorrow will continue our state’s fiscal prudence, with surpluses at the end of both the FY18/19 biennium and the following FY20/21 biennium.
I am determined that, when I leave office in two years, Minnesota’s finances will be in sound condition, and ready to support an even brighter future.
But our fiscal stability will be imperiled, if, as some suggest, we “Give it All Back” in tax cuts.
A feast of tax giveaways to a handful of wealthy individuals, corporations, and special interests, is NOT Minnesota's path to continued economic growth.
It might surprise some Minnesotans to learn that our state's personal income tax rates have remained exactly the same for the past sixteen years, except when a fourth tier, which affects only the wealthiest 2 percent, was added in 2013.
If anyone among the other 98 percent of Minnesotans is paying higher state income taxes, it is because your income has increased – NOT because the State has raised your taxes.
Similarly, no one has raised the state sales tax since 2008, except on tobacco.
Nevertheless, some politicians still try to mislead Minnesotans into believing that I have raised their taxes.
They also claim that more tax cuts are the keys to our future economic growth.
In 1999 and again in 2000, Minnesota's elected leaders tried just that.
Governor Ventura and Legislators twice lowered the state's personal income tax rates, to where they remain today.
Yet, cutting Minnesota's income taxes did not noticeably boost the state's economy, either before the Great Recession, or during it.
In fact, our state’s personal income and job losses were worse than the nation’s.
What those lower tax rates did do, however, was to drive the State Budget into severe and lasting deficits, which required difficult measures and almost a decade to resolve.
NO, low taxes have never been Minnesota's path to prosperity.
Instead, it is the public investments we have made with those tax revenues – especially in the educations of our citizens and the quality of our transportation and other infrastructure – that have been, and will continue to be, the keys to our citizens’ better standards of living.
As such, they should be our top priorities for putting those budget surpluses to work for Minnesotans.
When I ask businessmen and women why they are locating or expanding here, their Number One reason is almost always the quality, reliability, and productivity of our people.
Minnesotans inherently know and practice the virtues of honest, hard work.
But to enable all Minnesotans to achieve their full potentials, we must provide them with the best-possible educations, skills, and training that they will need to live successful lives and contribute to the successes of their communities.
Those excellent educations, from early childhood, to K-12 elementary and secondary, to colleges and universities, are increasingly the pre-requisites for better jobs, higher incomes, and healthier lifestyles.
If we were ever to lose our educational superiority, the damage to our state's social and economic well-being would be irreparable.
That is why a top priority during my six years as Governor has been to restore state funding for our elementary and secondary schools and our public colleges, universities, and technical schools; to provide free, all-day kindergarten for our five year-olds; and, now, to increase support for quality childcare and pre-kindergarten classes.
Those investments are our best strategies for closing achievement gaps and for raising the skill levels of all our students.
Earlier this month, the well-respected national education publication, Education Week, graded the fifty states' public school systems in three areas: K-12 Achievement, School Finance, and Early Childhood Education effectiveness.
Minnesota ranked the 11th best state overall.
We were 6th best for K-12 Achievement; third best, with an A rating, for our Early Education initiatives; but only 21st in per-pupil education funding, with a grade of D. From FY 2003 to FY 2012, real state aid for public school operations was cut by $1,741 per pupil, or 16.2 percent.
Total school district operating revenue fell by 7.8 percent, as property tax increases were not sufficient to replace the loss of state aid.
Working together, we have increased real state aid by $968 per pupil, from FY 2012 to FY 2017.
But, in real dollars, it will still be 7.2 percent less than it was in 2003.
It has fallen upon Minnesota's property taxpayers to try to make up the difference.
When I took office in 2011, I promised to increase Minnesota’s investments in E-12 education every year I was Governor – with no excuses, no exceptions.
With your support, we have kept that promise, and I'm not going to abandon it now.
So tomorrow I will propose 2 percent increases in the per-pupil aid formula for each year of the next biennium.
They are expensive, costing $371 million.
Some people will say we can't afford to make those investments.
I say, we can’t afford NOT to.
Frankly, I wish we could afford to do more.
The demands on our public schools from our ever-more diverse populations continue to grow.
As I said earlier, our schools' abilities to meet those growing needs – and to provide every student from every background with what she or he needs to become a successful adult – are crucial to their individual successes and to our state's better future.
Already, growing businesses throughout Minnesota are experiencing shortages of people to fill their available jobs, especially in more highly skilled areas – making our continued investments in education and workforce training even more important.
A recent Minnesota Public Radio story highlighted one businesses' predicament, which has become common all over our state.
Mike Rolih founded and runs GoRout, a three-year-old technology company in Rochester.
Mike couldn’t be with us tonight, but Lauren Scott, the company’s Senior Director, has joined us.
Mike says he's ready to increase sales dramatically this year, but he needs more trained staff to do so —and finding them in Rochester is proving difficult.
If he can't add the skilled workers he needs, he worries that his financial backers will pressure him to move his business elsewhere.
If GoRout, can grow successfully in Rochester, it will benefit not only the company and its employees, but also the entire city.
One investor said Rochester needs only one or two success stories like GoRout, to make the city the magnet for innovators that it wants to be.
Adding those businesses to the Destination Medical Center, being led so well by the Board's Chair, Lt. Governor Tina Smith, will multiply the benefits to our entire state.
Thus, increased investments in the University of Minnesota and Minnesota State are crucial to meeting businesses' future workforce needs.
It surprises some to learn that state funding for higher education – for Minnesota State, the University of Minnesota, and the state grant and loan programs – had fallen significantly during previous decades.
From Fiscal Years 2000 to 2013, real state support for higher education dropped by 48 percent.
And in FY2012, state funding for higher education had dropped to its lowest level, in real dollars, since 1981.
Those declines come as no surprise, however, to the outstanding leaders of our two State College and University Systems: U of M President Eric Kaler and Minnesota State Chancellor Steven Rosenstone.
I salute you both for your strong leadership during difficult times.
I especially want to thank Chancellor Rosenstone, who is retiring this summer, for your dedicated service to our state.
I'm glad to report that from Fiscal Years 13 to 15, state funding for higher education increased by 20 percent.
However, it only began to make up for the support lost previously.
Those reductions caused student tuitions to increase severely at our state colleges and universities.
In real dollars, tuitions more than doubled across all public postsecondary sectors from Fiscal Year 2000 to Fiscal Year 2012.
In nominal dollars, average tuitions more than tripled.
It’s wrong that so many of our students are graduating with degrees in their hands and mountains of student loan debt on their backs.
It jeopardizes their futures and our state’s future.
We can, and we must, do better; and my budget tomorrow will propose that we do so.
In addition to increasing General Fund support for our public colleges, universities, and student aid programs, is also critical that we increase the capital investments needed to repair and expand existing buildings and to build new, world-class facilities.
Many of those projects are included in my proposed Bonding Bill; but frankly, even that is not enough.
MN State and U of M campuses are falling farther and farther behind in their needed physical plant improvements.
They cannot provide first-rate educations in third-rate buildings and classrooms.
And those obsolete facilities will not attract either the number or the caliber of students needed for those institutions to be successful – and thus for Minnesota to remain successful.
If we invest in them now, however, our colleges and universities will produce the entrepreneurs, the ideas, the workers, and the products to drive business and job growth throughout Minnesota for decades to come.
But we cannot expect our schools to be successful, or our economy to flourish, if we fail our kids before they even enter their classrooms.
That is why the most essential component of a successful education strategy – and our highest priority – must be to improve early learning opportunities for ALL of Minnesota's youngest children.
The best way to close the Achievement Gap is to stop it before it begins.
The good news is that we have made great progress already.
But those gains aren’t yet enough.
When I ran for office, I promised to expand state-funded Kindergarten to serve all of Minnesota's five year-olds.
Today, because of legislative support in 2013, over 55,000 children are attending all-day K, and we have tremendous results to show for it.
But the research says that, to be most effective, we need to start even earlier to improve young children's lives.
The legislature deserves credit for increasing state support for quality childcare and supportive family services during the past six years.
Last year, you provided the first state funding for pre-kindergarten school programs, which was immediately oversubscribed by eager school districts, and now benefits 3,300 Minnesota four-year-olds.
Combined with 26,700 early learning scholarships, more Minnesota children are getting the better starts they need today for their better tomorrows.
However, too many children are still being left behind, because we haven’t done enough to ensure that ALL of them have excellent early learning opportunities.
Take, for instance, the Marshall Public School District.
Led by Superintendent Scott Monson, who is here with us tonight, they applied for pre-K funding.
A grant would have helped 52 of their youngest learners.
Unfortunately, because of the state program's inadequate funding, Marshall was one of 160 school districts that could not be supported this year.
Nevertheless, Marshall, like many school districts, is moving ahead anyway.
With limited funding, but great determination, they have enrolled 125 students in their “Little Cubs” program for three, four, and five year-olds.
Thanks to state funding for other early childhood programs, including scholarships, Marshall has been able to keep costs down for families enrolling in preschool.
Thank you, Superintendent Monson.
And thank you to your tremendous pre-Kindergarten team, who have joined us here tonight.
Jill Schwartz and Darci Love – your work makes an enormous difference in the lives and educations of your students.
Minnesota is better for your exceptional efforts.
But we must do more to support our young children all over our state.
That is why, in my budget, I will propose further increases in state funding for quality child care, for pre-kindergarten, and for other early childhood enhancements, such as visiting nurses for teen parents.
They will all help to ensure that every child starting kindergarten has a decent chance to be a successful student and to become a healthy, productive adult.
But don’t take my word for it.
To hear Janice and Milen Armstrong talk about the gains their four-year-old daughter, Jannah, has made since beginning voluntary pre-K is to understand what early education means for Minnesota families.
Before their daughter, Jannah, began pre-K, her parents took turns staying home to care for her.
But her limited interactions with other children were starting to affect her physical skills, vocabulary, and emotional development.
Janice and Milen believed that Jannah could benefit from high-quality child care, but they couldn’t afford the cost.
However, since Jannah, began attending free pre-K, five days a week, she has blossomed.
Her vocabulary has increased tremendously, her motor skills are improving, and she has made great friends at school.
She will be ready to start Kindergarten this fall.
Having Jannah in school has also given more freedom to her parents.
Janice has returned to school part-time, and is applying to nursing programs for the fall.
Thank you, Janice and Milen, for sharing Jannah's success with all of us.
The Armstrongs’ story illustrates what voluntary pre-K can do to help young children and their families,throughout our state.
Why wouldn't we want to provide those better opportunities for everyone?In addition to our moral responsibility to ensure that every child receives a world-class education, there is another important reason to make these additional investments.
Because our future depends upon them.
The complexion of Minnesota today is very different from the state I grew up in.
Back then, diversity training was teaching the Germans to get along with the Scandinavians – or the Norwegians with the Swedes.
Now, Minnesota looks more like the world.
Between 2000 and 2015, our state’s white population grew by 3 percent, adding about 109,000 people.
During that same period, all populations of color in our state increased by 79 percent, adding about 461,000 people.
And, to our benefit, Minnesota will become even more racially and ethnically diverse in the years ahead.
Some people want Minnesotans, who are different from them, to “go away.
In Minnesota today, children, teenagers, and adults are arriving at school or work to find words of racial hatred, religious bigotry, or other smears written on their walls, lockers, and bathroom stalls.
This ugliness has no place in our schools, our workplaces, or our communities – and each of us has a responsibility to stand up, and snuff it out.
The students I met recently at Maple Grove High School have shown me, and all of us, the courage it will take to make Minnesota a better place for everyone.
When racist words were scrawled on the bathroom walls in their High School, some students organized a walkout, and have since continued their efforts to create a safer, more tolerant school for ALL their fellow students.
As a speaker at last week’s Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, Maple Grove student Morgan Eames said, “We cannot be complacent.
We cannot wish away our problems.
We must be bold, steadfast and have the courage of conviction to peacefully confront racism against any and every one, irrespective of race, caste, and religion.
Morgan is here with us tonight.
She is joined by her friends, Chance Laurie, and Moses Karngbaye.
Morgan, Chance, and Moses, you are our state’s future.
And our future is brighter, because of your courage.
Last year, during this address, I said that Minnesota state government needed to lead by example, and increase the diversity in state employment to 20 percent, when I leave office, to more fully reflect the diversity among our citizens.
In 2011, 8 percent of state employees were women and men of color.
Today, it is 11 percent.
Similarly, I have committed state government to increasing the percentage of employees with disabilities to seven percent by August 2018.
Now, we are at 6.2 percent, and I am confident that we will reach, or even surpass, that important goal.
These efforts have provided employment opportunities for more Minnesotans of all backgrounds and abilities.
They have helped to create a more inclusive and representative state government.
There is more we need to do, but we are working hard at it.
Along with education, the other most important investments we can make to create better futures for Minnesotans are in transportation and other infrastructure improvements.
I have spoken about the need to improve our state's highways, roads, bridges, and public transit systems during every one of my previous State of the State Addresses.
I've said the situation is urgent.
One legislator partly agreed with me last year.
"He said the problem was ""urgent, but not that urgent."
Well, I think our transportation deficiencies are that urgent.
Roads, highways, and public transit are to our state’s economy, like arteries to the human body.
If the arteries are healthy and efficiently transport blood, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the body, everything works at its best.
