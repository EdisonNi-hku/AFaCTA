SENTENCES
"A few days ago, we inaugurated an era of change and renewal in New York politics, an era in which we will reduce the costs, the burdens and the intrusions of government in order to preserve and protect personal freedom, and restore individual responsibility."
And in doing so unleash the creativity and energy of the people that remains the real source of social progress and economic opportunity.
"In a few moments, as we begin the people's business, I will put before you a business-like agenda for change."
"Change that will get New York's economy growing again with spending cuts, tax cuts, budget reform and regulatory reform."
"Change that will strengthen New York's approach to crime and justice, reform welfare and make government more accessible and accountable to the people."
"But before we begin work on a list of specific proposals and reforms, I wonder if I might begin -- as the first chief executive in some time to have served in both houses of this Legislature -- with a personal note to the many friends and former colleagues I see here today."
"First, I want to say how deeply heartened I have been by the warm reaction to our new administration from citizens all across the state, and I want to take special note of the offers of support and cooperation that have come from so many in this chamber today -- from both sides of the political aisle."
"Such pledges have filled me with a sense of optimism and excitement about what you and I, and a superbly talented group of new administration appointees, can accomplish together for the people of New York."
"As I prepared to deliver my first State of the State Address, I had expected to look out among the faces in this chamber and see the face of our friend, Angelo Del Toro."
"Instead, I joined Speaker Silver and many of you at his funeral yesterday."
"We all miss Angelo and while we don't see Angelo here today, we nevertheless sense his presence."
His spirited love for the people of this state still fills this chamber.
"With his memory in mind, let us now turn ourselves to the tasks of public service Assemblyman Del Toro loved so much."
The agenda of reform and renewal I will put before you today is specific and extensive.
It sets out clear priorities; but let me also say it is not meant as a list of everything that we may try to accomplish together in 1995.
I know there is much to do; that each and every lawmaker has ideas worthy of attention by the Legislature and this administration.
"This is a new era, a new beginning in which bipartisan participation can make a difference in the future of New York."
"Today, I want you to know that our administration looks forward to working closely with the Legislature, that I consider bipartisanship a two-way street."
"And I especially want you to know that -- because, for me, friends always stay friends -- the door to this governor's office is always open to each of you."
But I also want to point out that under our democratic system our first duty must be to keeping faith with the people.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has a proven record of putting principle ahead of politics.
"He is a good leader, a good friend, and I look forward to working with him to meet the challenges we must face together."
"And my good friend Joe Bruno, the Senate Majority Leader, has often been the source of wise counsel to me."
"Just as I've sought his help in the past, I'm sure I will rely on him again in the days ahead."
"In recent elections, the people have shown themselves not only willing to make changes -- but to go right on making changes until those of us elected to office get it right."
"What I said a few days ago, I repeat today: The people have called for smaller, more effective, more efficient government."
We must not fail to give them the change they seek.Let us get it right.
"The agenda I am putting before you today is one that seeks change that is immediate and real, sweeping and fundamental -- the kind of change the people have demanded of us."
The people are waiting and watching.
"They have demanded change, they expect action."
"Starting here, starting today, we will give them both."
"THE BUDGET CHALLENGE The challenges we face are great, the budget deficit is approaching $5 billion."
Only recently did we learn how large the deficit would be.
"Now, as one who long argued for realism and openness in the budget process, I will admit that in one sense I was glad to get the facts."
"But while I appreciated the candor about the size of the deficit, I must also tell you I felt a bit like John Jacob Astor, that passenger on the Titanic who remarked shortly after the iceberg struck: ""I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous."
"Surely the size of this deficit is a crisis -- a crisis, as I have stated before, not of the people's making but of government's."
"And what government has done, government can undo."
"Members of the Legislature, we begin here today by acknowledging a simple fact: the government of New York State is too big and it spends too much money."
"Today, and in the foreseeable future, we must and we will cut spending -- and then cut it again."
"Let there be no mistake: to preserve and protect personal freedom, to restore individual responsibility, to create a government which is smaller, more effective and more efficient is the challenge of the 90's."
"To achieve that, we must return to individuals the right to choose how they spend their money."
This means taking less from wage earners and giving less to government.
"It is time to cut spending, cut taxes and encourage New Yorkers to earn more, save more, invest more and create more jobs."
It is time to cut regulation and encourage achievement and success.
We begin with the budget and reducing government spending.
"While I will deal with budget matters fully when I submit the Budget Message on February 1st, let me state, here and now, four ways we propose reducing government spending."
"First, I will present an Executive Budget this year that spends less than last year, and does it without shell games or gimmicks."
"To provide the expertise needed to do this, we conducted a nationwide search for someone with the experience and knowledge needed to put our budget house in order."
We were successful in that search.
New York's new budget director is Patricia Woodworth.
"Her record of success in protecting the people's money in Florida and Michigan will help guide New York to cut spending, cut taxes, streamline state government and spur economic growth."
"I am also pleased to announce that Chief Judge Kaye, Comptroller McCall and Attorney General Vacco have notified me that they will revise their budget requests for the coming fiscal year -- downward."
"Second, reducing the cost of state government means reducing the size of state government."
We will reorganize and reduce state government bureaucracy.
We will consolidate agencies and authorities that duplicate effort and eliminate offices that no longer meet the needs of the people.
"We will move to abolish the Energy Office, the Cable Television Commission, and look to combine New York's array of economic development authorities into a single Empire State Economic Development Corporation."
"To guide the overhaul of New York's economic development programs, I have appointed former Ambassador Charles Gargano as our new economic development director."
His business background and real world sensibilities will help us prune the bureaucracy to more efficiently deliver services that encourage new growth in the private sector and reduce spending.
"We will also look to consolidate the Dormitory Authority, the Medical Care Facilities Financing Agency and the Facilities Development Corporation into a single Health and Education Authority."
"Third, the Medicaid system has grown far beyond its original intent as a provider of care for the needy."
Its costs have become staggering and the quality of care it provides leaves much to be desired.
"Under the leadership of Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey, a recognized expert in the national health care debate, this Administration has begun an exhaustive review of the Medicaid system."
Significant reforms proposed as a result of that effort will be incorporated in the Executive Budget proposal.
"Today, New York's Medicaid system costs three times as much per recipient and often delivers a quality of care inferior to the programs run by other states.We can do better and we must."
The potential of managed care in controlling costs and insuring quality of care in Medicaid and other health services can and must be fully and completely realized.
"To also help guide us on that journey, I have named Dr. Barbara Ann DeBuono as New York State's new Health Commissioner."
Her performance as Rhode Island's health director -- where she instituted mandatory managed care -- has demonstrated that government can reform health care without building new and costly bureaucracies.
"And fourth, our effort to reduce the size of state government will include exercising the option to privatize."
"To lead this initiative, I will ask businessman Ronald Lauder to head a special council on privatization to stimulate ideas for ways in which privatization can become a reality in New York State."
"This means looking to sell assets like JFK and LaGuardia airports, and sell publicly owned hotels and commercial real estate, putting these properties back on the tax rolls."
And it also means selectively targeting areas where a system of competitive bidding between the public and private sector can lower costs and provide for the more efficient delivery of services.
"These areas of budget savings -- agency consolidation and departmental restructuring, medicaid reform, and privatization are just some of the ways we will reduce spending."
"And as we move together to cut spending, we must also act to reform the budget process."
"From the time I present the Executive Budget message on February 1st to the start of the new fiscal year on April 1st, we have two brief months to complete our work."
Meeting the April budget deadline is essential.
That's why today I am asking you to approve budget bills by early March -- to have full and public debate in the light of day as we move toward the April 1st deadline.
"On this first point, let me be clear."
The practice of backroom budget-making must end.
"And when I talk about opening the budget process, I mean opening not just to the press and the public, I mean opening it up to all lawmakers -- to ""Rapp"" Rappleyea and the Assembly Republicans and to Marty Connor and the Senate Democrats."
"I know from personal experience that the quality of your ideas is not dependent on whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whether you are a member of the Majority or the Minority."
The people elected every legislator to speak for them in Albany.
I believe an open budget process can help us meet the budget deadline.And we must be on time.
I want to put everyone in this great legislative hall on notice here and now.
"If the April 1st deadline is not met, I will not initiate, nor will I approve, legislation to provide interim appropriations for any state functions except those that directly affect the health and safety of New Yorkers."
"And that means that if we don't have the budget done on time, there will be no ""emergency"" appropriations to pay the Executive or the Legislature."
"You won't be paid, and neither will I."
The people are asking to take more responsibility for their actions.
We must take more responsibility for our own.
We must enact the budget on time.
"Comptroller Carl McCall has publicly stated his views about the importance of an on-time budget, and his belief that we must end the practice and abuse of temporary appropriations."
I look forward to his support on this important issue.
"By cutting spending and cutting taxes, we will create a smaller, more effective, more efficient government which will foster a climate that allows individuals to excel and businesses to prosper."
"To protect personal freedom, government must stop unnecessarily burdening individuals and families with massive taxes which stifle initiative, creativity and job production."
These dollars do not belong to the government.
These dollars belong to the individuals who earned them.
We will not so much be cutting taxes as protecting people's right to keep the fruits of their own labors.
"As the first step toward the economic renewal of New York, we must finally keep the income tax cut promise the Legislature made in 1987."
Let me make another point very clear: I will veto any legislation that continues to break that tax cut promise by further delay.
We must go beyond that promise and deliver further personal income tax relief to the working poor and middle class New Yorkers.
We must reduce the tax burden that has shackled New York's entrepreneurial spirit.
"I will submit a tax cut plan that will include refundable credits, implementation of the 1987 tax act, acceleration of the earned income tax credit and family tax credit, stretching of income brackets, increases in standard deductions, lowering of ""bottom rates"" and ""fail safe"" measures for lower-income taxpayers."
Here's what it all really means.
"Over the next four years, it means: Bringing a 25% across-the board reduction in income taxes on New Yorkers."
"Moving individual liability for the top rate from the current $13,000 to $26,000 and, for married couples, from $26,000 to $50,000, a step that will bring direct and immediate help to the middle class."
"Tripling the current tax breaks for child and dependent care, a step that will bring tax relief to hard-pressed families."
"Increasing from $9,500 to $13,000 the standard deduction for married couples, something that will help thousands of the working poor by removing them from the tax rolls."
"Accelerating the earned income tax credit; another step that, by removing any tax incentive that might make some choose welfare over work, will help the working poor."
Lowering the tax rate on those who earn the least from 5.5% to 4%.
"By combining these tax reforms with spending cuts, we will set New York's economy on a path that leads to economic growth and job creation."
These spending cuts and these tax cuts are essential and will be part of my budget.
I urge you to pass that budget for the benefit of all New Yorkers.
"This government not only spends too much and taxes too much, it regulates too much."
The tangle of red tape that binds the lives of New Yorkers has simply grown too costly and too intrusive.
"We must free people from redundant, excessive, and overbearing regulation."
The people gave government the power to grow bigger.
Now the people have said that government has grown beyond their control.The people are right.
Government must be rolled back.
The regulatory burden on our people must be lifted.
I have a message today that must be heard beyond the walls of this Capitol.
"It must be heard by the men and women who live the American dream, create small businesses, run family farms, work day and night to make them succeed."
These are the individuals and families whose hard work creates jobs for others.
It is to these dreamers and doers that this new Governor and this new Administration pledge support for their efforts to make the Empire State the greatest state in the nation.
"For too long, their entrepreneurial spirit has been crushed by New York State regulation and taxation."
Jobs that should have stayed here have left.
Jobs that should have been created here were created elsewhere.
We must now act to enhance the freedom that fuels the entrepreneurial spirit.
"We must say to the small business man and woman: We want you, your children and your children's children to build your futures right here in New York."
"To free New Yorkers of their terrible regulatory burden, I will take several steps."
"First, I will sign an Executive Order declaring a moratorium on all new regulations -- except regulations needed to protect the public heath and safety or rules that promote new jobs and economic activity."
"Second, I have called upon Monroe County Executive and former Assemblyman Bob King to head our new regulatory reform effort."
"The goal of that effort will be to remove regulations that act as hidden taxes, hinder productivity, and stifle economic growth."
"Coordination of regulatory activities within and among agencies must be improved to eliminate inconsistencies, duplication and unnecessary regulatory burdens."
"Third, we will open the entire regulatory process to greater public scrutiny."
"It is a massive undertaking, but we must succeed and we will."
We have seen government at all levels -- from the White House to statehouses to city halls -- expand to the point where they have crowded out individual responsibility for the conduct of people's daily lives.
New York State and its local governments must be partners for change.
"The changes we enact here in Albany should help, not hurt local governments."
Our efforts to achieve a right size for state government can not be a real success if we simply make local governments bigger and more expensive to local taxpayers.
"We cannot cut taxes in Albany only to force tax increases in our counties, cities, towns, villages and school districts."
State government must not be streamlined by abandoning its responsibilities as unfunded mandates put a greater tax burden on local governments.
"As we cut spending in Albany, let us give local governments the mandate relief they need so they, too, can lower their costs of government."
We will stop unfunded mandates.
We will stop them in Albany and we will fight to stop them from Washington.
CRIME AND JUSTICE New York State's duty to preserve and protect personal freedom must also include protecting our citizens' right to be free from the fear of crime and violence.
"For too many years, government has made excuses for the criminal actions of some of its citizens."
It is time to hold criminals responsible for their individual actions.
"Our state's system of justice has given a second chance, a third chance, sometimes a dozen chances, to criminals who terrorize our communities.It is time for this to end."
"To protect the personal freedoms of innocent, law-abiding citizens, New York State must toughen its laws to put violent criminals behind bars and keep them there."
We must end parole for violent felons.
We must eliminate work release for dangerous convicts.
We must enact mandatory sentences for crimes committed with deadly weapons and toughen penalties for the criminal sale of firearms.
We must say: No more second or third chances for violent criminals.
"When you commit a violent crime in New York State, you will be caught, convicted and put in jail to serve your full sentence."
"To fight crime, we must be tough, but we also must be smart."
That means taking a new look at how we treat young offenders.
Young violent felons must be treated the same way we treat adult violent felons.
"But for other young offenders, it makes little sense to sentence them to prison terms that place them with hardened criminals who provide them with nothing more than tutorials leading to a life of crime."
It's time to reexamine how we sentence certain young offenders.
"We will be tough with those who belong in prison, but we must be smart with those who deserve punishment, but whose lives, which might otherwise be lost, can still be made productive."
"As for criminals who commit the ultimate crime, the crime of murder, they should expect to be punished by the ultimate sanction, the death penalty."
This Governor intends to send Thomas Grasso back to Oklahoma to receive the punishment he deserves.
This Governor will sign the death penalty bill you pass into law.
"The time has come to protect the personal freedom of New York's law-abiding citizens, to show compassion for the victims of crime and to send a clear, unmistakable message to violent criminals: No more excuses."
Your criminal acts are your responsibility and you will be held accountable.
"EDUCATION As the people ask to take greater responsibility for themselves, we must find ways for parents to take a greater role in the education of their children."
"Too many of our schools have become too impersonal, too insensitive, too aloof."
"As the spending on state education bureaucracy has grown, too little of that money has gone into our classrooms."
"For too long, schools have become preoccupied with administration, regulation and social experimentation when they should be teaching our children to meet the competition of the global marketplace -- a marketplace that in the 21st Century will not be just one for goods and products, but a marketplace for ideas and information."
"Toward that end, I will ask the Legislature to embark upon major reforms of our educational system, to restore accountability, to encourage excellence, and to provide the safety our schools need to be truly effective places for learning."
"I will ask the Legislature to streamline the State Education bureaucracy, and to begin the process of abolishing the outdated state Board of Regents, which places educational policy-making too far from parents, teachers and students."
"We must also work to improve educational accountability with reforms that improve public review of school budgets, including plain language requirements, and we should consider reforms that would initiate a statewide voting day for school budgets and the election of school board members to expand voter participation."
"Further, we must change the way we finance our schools in many different ways."
"We should reward school districts that spend money in the classroom on teachers and children, instead of wasting tax dollars on needless bureaucracy."
We must look for new and better ways to educate our children.
"As other states and nations have moved progressively forward, we will study their successes."
We will learn from their experience and build upon their reforms to make New York the world leader again in the education of children.
"WELFARE And just as we have a tradition of educational excellence, New Yorkers have a proud tradition of caring and compassion for those of our citizens most in need."
"However, the unbridled growth of well-intentioned welfare programs has taught us an important lesson about the quality of compassion."
We have learned that compassion is not a commodity.
The gift of real compassion is opportunity and hope.
"It protects personal freedom, fosters self-reliance and restores individual responsibility."
"When government takes responsibility for people, people stop taking responsibility for themselves."
Plainly stated: Welfare isn't working.
We must reform the welfare system.
"Not to save money, but to save lives, to help needy New Yorkers escape the confines of welfare dependency and live full, productive lives."
Workfare must replace welfare in New York State.
"To allow all people to be productive and be part of the success of our economy, we must strive to provide the opportunity of work for every welfare recipient."
Single mothers who enter the workforce should get day care.
Able-bodied individuals without children must work.
"And we must permit low-income workers to keep more of their earnings, increasing the value of work over welfare."
The sad fact is that the highest marginal tax rate in this nation is paid by individuals moving from the welfare rolls to the payrolls.
"That is wrong, and it must stop."
"By lowering the bottom tax rate, accelerating the Earned Income Tax Credit and initiating the Family Tax Credit that triples the tax benefit for child and dependent care, we will cut taxes for the working poor."
The experience of Westchester County has shown that government can restore hope with workfare over welfare.
"New York State's new Social Services Commissioner, Mary Glass from Westchester County, is another acknowledged national expert who has the experience and ideas to make workfare a reality all across this state."
"Further, New York must move forward in implementing a ""learnfare"" policy that provides incentives to parents who make their children attend school."
"Just as we will require adults to work to break the cycle of dependency, we must give children an education to help them escape the cycle of dependency."
GOVERNMENT REFORM People are demanding a greater voice in their government.And it is time they got it.
Citizen initiative and referendum will let the people have that voice.
It will allow them to act even if their elected representatives choose not to.
"If New Yorkers had the power of initiative and referendum, the issue of the death penalty would have been resolved long ago."
"This year, I ask you to take the first step toward empowering New Yorkers with the power of citizen initiative and referendum."
I will ask you to give first passage to a constitutional amendment that will give the voters that right.
"And as we empower the citizens of New York State, we must also encourage change by taking the first steps toward term limits for state officials."
Term limits will help create a government filled with new ideas and fresh perspectives.
The time for term limits is at hand.
I understand your natural reluctance to pass a constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on the state Legislature.so let's start with me.
"Let's enact first passage of a constitutional amendment that would limit the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general to two consecutive terms."
"It has worked in 29 other states, and it can work here."
"A LAWMAKER'S PERSPECTIVE Ten years ago, during my first day as Member of the Assembly, as I listened to the Governor deliver his State of the State Message, I sat in the seat where freshman Assemblyman Jay Dinga is sitting now."
I felt privileged then -- and I feel privileged now -- to be part of this great institution.
"Today, let me say to Assemblyman Dinga, and to all the new Members of the Assembly and Senators, the energy and enthusiasm you feel today can and will only grow as you accept and meet the challenges of solving the problems facing our people."
"As my friends, those veterans of the Legislature -- Republicans and Democrats -- who have served here with me know, you newcomers will come to share with us, a deep respect for the job of lawmaker."
It is within the Legislature that the twin spirits of America's civic life -- freedom and responsibility -- live and prosper.
A free people choose representatives to serve them in free and open elections; grant those representatives the responsibility to serve the people's interests faithfully and to the best of their ability.
"Every day, lawmakers here in Albany and across our nation work to reaffirm the faith of our founders."
"Within the democratic institutions of our nation and our state, legislators work day in and day out to fulfill the important responsibility of serving the public interest."
"It is demanding, often gritty work."
It is fiercely competitive among diverse interests.
"As our laws are made, complex and conflicting elements are hammered into a new form through debate and negotiation.It is an honorable endeavor."
The Legislature is a marketplace of ideas.
It is a forum in which to achieve a fair balance among competing interests in the process of determining the public interest.
"As public servants, we have a solemn duty to protect and preserve personal freedom and restore individual responsibility, to create a more efficient, more effective government, a government that is smaller in size, yet meets the essential needs of its people."
"Working together, we can and must encourage individuals and families to build their futures here with a government that allows them the freedom to achieve, a government that gives them the opportunity to create jobs, a government that fosters tolerance, decency and hope.It is a great challenge."
It is a challenge we must meet.
"And together as we meet this challenge, we will restore New York to the greatness that is its destiny.Thank you, and God Bless."
