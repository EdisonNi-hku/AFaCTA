sentences
President Jennings, Speaker Webster, members of the Supreme Court, my friend and partner, Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay, members of the Cabinet, members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, my fellow Floridians: We're blessed to be Floridians and live in this time of great opportunity for our state.
We have much to be proud of this morning: Our crime rate is down for four years in a row; our welfare reforms are taking root -- 23,000 families have left the welfare rolls since last July; and job creation and personal incomes are up.
Yes, the State of our State is strong.
But, there is more work for us to do.
This Session is a historic one.
For the first time, in a long time, both the House and Senate are in the control of the Republicans.
But, I'd like to remind my Republican friends that, to truly lead, you're going to need the help and experience of your Democratic colleagues.
And let's remember, a Democrat still sits in the Governor's chair.
Our government power may be divided -- but our work doesn't have to be divisive.
More than ever, we need each other.
Our people expect us to work together.
I believe we've already proven that we can.
Together we've worked to reform workers' compensation, end welfare, strengthen our economy and promote jobs.
We've taken major steps to hold criminals responsible and make them serve time for their crimes -- and we've created a new juvenile justice department.
We did these reforms not as Democrats and Republicans -- we did them as Floridians.
During this session let's continue this good bipartisan work.
Let's work to promote safe neighborhoods; safeguard our environment; and protect our elders.
And let's make this the year we begin to restore the people's trust by passing meaningful election reform.
I want to discuss all these issues with you -- but not today.
Today, I want to speak with you about a journey I've been on.
It started in the Florida House, where I served for eight years.
Then four years in the Florida Senate.
I took a walk that led me to the U. S. Senate for 18 years.
And now for the past six years I've been proud to serve as your Governor.
I thought I was pretty darn good.
I had a lot of answers -- and I proposed a lot of solutions.
I knew how to play the game.
But now, 36 years later, I find I didn't even know where first base was.
First base is our children.
The answer to our most pressing problems begins with the child.
Every one in this chamber, together with all our business leaders, knows that if we want Florida to be a great state.
if we want to maintain a high standard of living.
if we want to preserve our wonderful quality of life.
we must have high-skilled, high-paying jobs.
We also know for Florida to get there, we must greatly improve our education product.
But in this quest for improving education, where do we start?
Many would say first grade or kindergarten.
Some would say prekindergarten.
I submit to you the evidence is now overwhelming.
Education must start at gestation.
BRAIN RESEARCH We've known intuitively that children who are loved and nurtured get along better and are smarter.
But now, with a revolution in brain research, we can observe the day-to-day growth of the brain.
We're learning about the tremendous explosion in brain development that occurs from ages 0 to 3.
The facts are very compelling.
While a child is growing in its mother's womb, its brain adds 250,000 neurons per minute.
At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons -- about the same number of nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way.
From birth to age 1, the number of brain connections mushrooms from about 50-trillion to 1,000-trillion.
This vast number of connections helps ensure the child can adapt to any environment.
The connections that aren't stimulated -- through voices, sight, touch and other nurturing -- will eventually die off.
The more words a child hears by the age of two, the larger that child's vocabulary will be.
A three-year-old exposed to music every day has a head start in developing problem solving skills that later become complex math and engineering skills.
This phenomenal growth continues through age 3.
These connections are the critical foundation for a child's future learning.
By age 10, the majority of the brain's building process has taken place.
Once this window of opportunity closes you have to play catch up -- and the cost of that is very high.
These discoveries should inspire us to change the way we develop public policy -- from child care, education and welfare reform through criminal justice.
This morning, the United Way of Florida and I had a packet of information on this revolutionary research delivered to your offices.
Read this information.
You will find that it's not just the scientists, it's not just the children's advocates, and it's not just Lawton Chiles.
I'm including the report of the Committee of Economic Development -- a group of America's top C-E-Os.
The top business leaders of this country are beginning to understand how this research can impact their bottom lines.
"This is not social ""do goodism."
This is bottom line common sense.
This brain research can help us get way ahead of our greatest problems.
As Florida's leaders, you owe it to yourselves -- and to your constituents -- to learn as much as you can about this research because the implications are so dramatic.
Science is lighting a new path that shows how nurturing our children can begin to change the destructive cycle so many of our people are on.
Let's follow that path.
PROMOTING FAMILIES A child is the most wonderful gift in the world.
We know successful children start with good parents.
Parenting can be a very tough job.
And, parents need all the help they can get.
For today's parents, Grandma is a thousand miles away and the neighbors are at work.
The support system that we grew up with is not there.
Government doesn't raise children -- parents do.
The state has a role, but the state can't be a parent.
The state CAN invest in community-driven programs to help.
If we want kids to be ready to achieve when they start school, then we must ensure all kids are loved and nurtured before they turn five.
Whether they stay at home or are in child care.
We can do this by promoting quality child care, fully funding prekindergarten and supporting parents in their role as a child's first teacher.
There are some wonderful models working in our state where communities have partnered with the private sector and are doing great things for our kids.
Let's work to replicate them and challenge our business community to play an even greater role and support parents in raising healthy children.
We need more good ideas from the private sector like Take Stock in Children.
More businesses need to follow the lead of firms like Honeywell and Barnett Banks who have made a commitment to support their workforce with parent education and child care assistance.
QUALITY CHILD CARE Babies who aren't nurtured, stimulated and loved, develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal.
On the other hand, studies show you can raise a child's I-Q 20 points by exposing them to an enriching environment.
Just think of the implications this has for our welfare reform effort.
We know adequate child care is critical to making welfare reform work.
That's why I'm asking to use WAGES savings to provide child care for those transitioning off welfare.
Yet, if we are going to require a mother transitioning off welfare to put her three-month-old in child care, we have to ensure that setting is a good place for that child to be.
It can't be CUSTODIAL day care -- it must be QUALITY child care.
But, while we promote child care for WAGES participants, we also must help workers on the welfare margins.
We shouldn't punish people who stay off welfare by working hard and struggling to make ends meet.
We know that, for these families, affordable quality child care is an oxymoron.
Quality child care is expensive.
For an office assistant earning minimum wage, with two children, child care can eat up most of that working mom's paycheck.
If we want to make work pay, let's fund our subsidized child care waiting list.
That's the best way to keep people off welfare.
TEEN PARENTS As a country and as a state, we are deeply divided on the question of abortion.
whether it should be permitted at all.
and if so, when it should be allowed and under what circumstances.
But, we do not have to be divided on the issue of teen pregnancy.
One third of teen pregnancies end in abortion.
We know children born to teens are more likely to live in poverty, to be raised by a single parent and are more likely to become teen parents themselves.
The federal government is challenging the states to reduce teen pregnancy without increasing abortion.
And they're offering the carrot of $20 million to the first five states who make the greatest progress.
Work with me to develop a strategy to accomplish this goal.
This is the kind of challenge that both Democrats and Republicans ought to be able to take up.
PROMOTING ADOPTION We've also worked hard to promote adoption in Florida.
I'm proud that we've found homes for nearly 1,600 kids last year.
That's an 80 percent jump over 1990.
We established an internet home page and it's been a very popular site.
Since July, we've had 12,000 hits on our web site.
I'm pleased to tell you that we're about to have our first adoption off of the home page.
Angelo and Marion Figueroa, of Fort White, were interested in adoption and found a four-year-old child named Nate on our home page.
It was love at first sight.
Nate has been placed with the Figueroas since January and the adoption should soon be finalized.
We need to help more people like Angelo and Marion Figueroa adopt Florida children.
Let's fund the adoption subsidy that helps families provide a loving home for a child who has been abused, neglected or abandoned.
PREVENTING CHILD ABUSE Science is finding that violent experiences in early childhood can lead to brain dysfunction.
That's why we must ensure our children grow up in nurturing homes free from violence and abuse.
There is a cycle of abuse that grips too many families -- with the abused becoming the abuser.
We must end that cycle.
Often, where there is domestic violence, there is child abuse.
Even when domestic violence is only witnessed by a child -- that is child abuse just the same.
Thank you for helping place Florida in the forefront of preventing family violence.
Our good work has led to a higher awareness of domestic and sexual violence -- and it's helping to prevent child abuse.
However, last year, 91 Florida children died from child abuse.
The facts on these cases are heart-wrenching.
But, their stories are real -- and they're repeated time and time again.
Bradley McGee, Lucas Ciambrone and more recently Kendia Lockhart.
"With each of these high profile cases, we ask ""Why?"
"How could this happen?"""
The names change, the answers stay the same.
We must strengthen the corps of people working in our communities to keep our children safe and sound.
I recently had the opportunity to shadow a few of our child protective services workers for part of their day.
It was an eye-opening experience.
I encourage you to take some time and go out with these workers.
See where they have to go and what they are dealing with.
You'll find that they are not the Gestapo -- they're closer to guardian angels.
Go see for yourself.
They are overworked and don't get the support they need.
We need to invest in these workers and pass a training and pay plan that rewards competency.
This will help us retain the best workers in this most critical job and help them make the smart decisions we demand they make.
STRENGTHENING EDUCATION Education is the primary children's issue that we'll address during this session.
We all have our individual lists of what SHOULD be done to improve our schools.
Perhaps we could focus on a short list of what MUST be done.
I think we would all agree that we must: increase school standards; reduce crowded schools; and make schools a safe place for our kids.
PROMOTING HIGHER STANDARDS -- We need to start by challenging every parent to have their children reading by the end of the first grade.
We can help by providing one-on-one instruction for first graders who need help learning to read.
Let's do this.
We can't afford to leave any child behind.
We've all seen the studies that show only 54 percent of students have the math, reading and writing skills to succeed in college.
We know that, more than ever, students need higher skills to succeed in the workplace.
That means we must expect more of them throughout their school days.
How long will we pay $57 million per year to remediate students at the community college level who don't have adequate reading, writing and math skills?
How long will we pay $126 million for drop out prevention programs?
Florida is ahead of the nation on setting standards.
Our efforts in math are already receiving national attention.
We can do better.
Kids ought to be able to read, write and do math at their grade level.
Those who don't should receive the help they need.
Our children ought to have critical thinking skills, and ought to be able to apply that knowledge in their studies -- and in their lives.
And every high school graduate in Florida should know and understand basic Algebra.
If you send me a clean bill to raise school standards, I will sign it.
Let's make that the first piece of business this session.
ENDING SCHOOL OVERCROWDING -- Last year, after I returned from the National Education Summit, I asked Lt. Governor MacKay and Dr. Jack Critchfield, C-E-O of Florida Progress Corporation to lead a Governor's Commission on Education.
This two-year citizen's panel is made up of some of the state's top leaders.
Its first recommendation is that we take immediate action to end overcrowding in our schools.
You'll recall, this isn't the first time Florida's faced an overcrowding problem.
Less than four years ago, we faced an overcrowding problem in our prisons.
The need was so urgent that I called you back in a special session to address it.
We made room for CRIMINALS in our PRISONS.
Now, I challenge you to make room for CHILDREN in our SCHOOLS.
I understand the concerns that many of you have when you say waste helped put our schools in this hole.
But, I don't think our schools wasted $3 billion.
We must take action.
Standing room only classrooms are a roadblock to our children's education.
Let's adopt the Education Commission's recommendation.
Let's EXPAND the gross receipts tax as a tool to SHRINK class sizes in our state.
Let this be the session where the districts get every tool they need to end school overcrowding.
"PROMOTING SAFE SCHOOLS -- Our schools also must be ""safe zones"" for our children to learn."
Recently, I attended a town meeting on school safety in West Palm Beach.
At that meeting, I heard from the mother of Johnpierre Kamel.
Her 14 -year-old son was shot to death recently during a school yard argument over a watch.
She gave moving testimony on why we must stop the violence.
I was impressed that this mother, who just lost her son, spoke with love -- and not vengeance -- in her heart.
Whether it's fists or firearms, this tragedy illustrates why we must expand our safe schools program.
We must provide a secure place for teachers to teach and children to learn.
OPENING THE DOOR TO HIGHER EDUCATION Higher standards; smaller classrooms and safe schools are the basics when it comes to helping our kids learn.
But, our economy demands that we also must provide a quality higher education for our children.
I trust we will move forward and increase college tuition.
This will continue our goal to create a world-class university system.
Last year, the Legislature took a great step to restore the Lottery's promise.
I want to thank you for creating the Lottery Scholarship program.
But, there was a slight oversight.
There were no dollars provided for the program.
I've taken care of that in my budget.
I know you will, too.
With the higher college tuition though, we must ensure we don't price out our neediest students.
It's important to reward educational achievement but, we need to look at all our financial assistance programs -- including the lottery scholarship -- to provide more for needy students.
FIGHTING TOBACCO As we are talking about how to promote our children's education, we must ensure that they learn about being healthy.
Every year, 40,000 of our Florida kids start smoking.
That's the equivalent of three classrooms full of kids that start smoking every day.
One-third of those children will die from a smoking-related injury.
Why is this happening?
"""Tobacco is a ""highly."
"effective and cheap drug"" and cigarettes are ""a 'drug' administration system."
That's not me talking.
That's a quote from a memo written by a researcher for British American Tobacco Industries -- the parent company of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation.
"That, and a number of other ""secret"" documents are coming to light from our lawsuit and others around the nation."
They're showing that the tobacco cartel has known for a very long time how addictive its products are.
Last year, tobacco became the leading cause of death in our state -- killing more Floridians than murders, car crashes, suicides, AIDS and fires combined.
And cigarettes have served as a gateway to illicit drugs for too many of our children.
A study of Florida teens who smoke or use other tobacco products show they are: three times more likely to drink alcohol; six times more likely to use marijuana; and eight times more likely to use cocaine.
We know there are ways to protect our kids from tobacco.
California has shown the way by implementing a comprehensive tobacco education program.
That program has helped decrease smoking in the state by 40 percent.
I've proposed a 10-cent hike in the cigarette tax to help educate our kids about tobacco.
If we could decrease smoking in this state by 40 percent, we would realize tremendous savings.
Please join me in protecting our kids from tobacco.
MAKING INVESTMENT ON THE FRONT END Can we afford to experiment with these front-end investments?
Our experience demonstrates that these front-end investments save dollars.
Six years ago we made a commitment to prenatal care and established Healthy Start.
We've brought infant mortality down by 23 percent to well below the national average.
And we've saved at least 1,500 lives because of our investment in prenatal care.
More than that -- we have thousands of kids born healthy at full-term.
The savings from this are great.
I had the pleasure of being escorted to the chamber this morning by some of the children whose futures are brighter because of our smart investment that we started five years ago.
We need to expand this ground breaking effort to help even more of our children.
Since 1990, through community partnerships with Kiwanis of Florida, Healthy Start and the Department of Health, we've increased immunization levels among two-year-olds by 21 percent.
Now, more than 80 percent of our two-year olds are immunized.
For every dollar we spend to immunize our child from measles, mumps and rubella we save more than $14 in health care costs.
More than that, we don't have to worry about a massive outbreak of these preventable childhood diseases anymore.
To improve education, we also must ensure our kids are healthy when they get to school.
We know a sick child can't learn.
That's why I'm asking you to help us expand the Healthy Kids program.
We've reduced emergency room visits by up to 70 percent in Healthy Kids counties.
School attendance and grades are up among children participating in the program.
We currently serve nearly 30,000 children in 16 counties.
Let's boost the program and triple the number of kids in the program and expand it to 12 more counties this year.
Does your county have a Healthy Kids program?
"If it doesn't, maybe this is the session you need to ask ""Why Not?"""
We've seen our front-end programs that bear tremendous fruit.
But, it's the back end programs that are gnawing away at our budget year after year.
Over the past six years, funding for prisons has grown by two-thirds and juvenile justice funding has jumped by half.
We've taken the necessary steps to keep criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
There are no waiting lists for admission to our prison system.
We do have a waiting list for prekindergarten -- and there are 13,000 children on it.
We do have a waiting list for women who need Healthy Start -- there are 30,000 mothers on it.
We do have a waiting list for child care so parents can go to work -- there are more than 30,000 children on it.
When you look at the budget, you see we've got it backwards.
For every dollar Florida spends on prevention services for kids, we spend $2.50 directly on prisons, juvenile justice and other back end items.
It's not an either or.
We can't stop the back end programs.
They deal with the results of our neglect.
But, do we want to do something that will reduce the percentage of our budget that goes to these programs?
Let's take a hard look at the way we develop our budget.
And let's ensure our kids have a seat at the table when conference committee time comes around.
I know many of you sincerely believe that we can't afford to pay for these things.
But, none of us said we can't afford to make felons serve longer sentences.
We don't say we can't afford to build the level 8 and 10 beds to take dangerous juveniles off the street.
We had to do that.
I submit we can't afford not to fund these front-end programs for our kids.
It's pay now or pay more later.
And we are paying more later.
Too much more.
STATE OF THE STATE: STATE OF OUR CHILDREN As Governor, it is my privilege to be able to address the Legislature each year and discuss the state's most important issues.
"Although this is called the ""State of the State"" I think the real question is: What is the state of our children?"
Today the answer is poor.
But, the answer for the future lies in the action you take during this session.
500 kids are born in Florida every day.
So, 30,000 will be born during this Legislative Session.
How they fare will answer the questions of whether we will have that higher-skilled, higher-paid workforce.
or a mediocre state rife with problems and unhappy people.
My journey has made a big circle.
It has brought me back to the beginning.
All my years, all my gray hair, all my failures and successes tell me children is where it's at.
My message is simple: To be a successful state, we must nurture successful children.
And that begins at gestation.
Today, the game begins.
Let's not forget first base.
