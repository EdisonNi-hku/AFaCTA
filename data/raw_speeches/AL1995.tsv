Congratulations, Senator!
It was my pleasure to work with Governor Siegelman as Secretary of State.
This time around, our working relationship continues stronger than ever.
Now, Speaker Clark, young fellow that he is, came to Montgomery after I left--for the second half of his 23-year tenure in the Legislature.
"We jointly have 27 years of ""on the job training."
The Speaker holding 85 percent of those years and my holding 15 percent.
It goes without saying I look forward to working with Speaker Clark and will rely heavily on his experience and leadership.
I appreciate your opening of all committee meetings to the public and scheduling two weeks of budget hearings before the third legislative day.
I'm proud of the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Bill Fuller, who will place the Ten Commandments in the State House, and for his excellent suggestion that we put a safety factor of one percent in the Alabama Special Educational Trust Fund to protect it from proration.
Rep. Fuller and I were born and raised in Chambers County, where thrift and the Commandments were duly taught.
I appreciate Rep. Alvin Holmes' long-standing support of my efforts to reduce the costs of government.
In my first term, Rep. Holmes was a strong advocate of cutting the governor's pay.
In my second term, my good friend advocates the governor pay rent for living in the mansion.
I am pleased to report that my budget reflects a 15 percent cut in the Governor's Office, the Executive Mansion, the Contingency Fund, and the office of the Finance Director.
It is good to know I can always count on Rep. Holmes to lead the charge for fiscal restraint and responsibility.
We have 127 school systems in Alabama.
Forty-three systems, one-third of the total, exceed the national average on nationally-normed Stanford Achievement Tests given in grades four and eight.
Many other systems are improving.
We need to commend them for a job well-done and urge them to continue.
However, in some systems students did not score well at all.
Those students need our help now!
First, Alabama law already gives the state superintendent of education authority to remedy defects that cause a school system to fail.
However, not once in more than 12 years has any direct action been taken to identify and remedy the defects of a failing school system.
I have long concluded there is a management problem at the state level.
"We are charged tonight with a genuine ""sense of urgency"" to rescue thousands of students who will depart their schools with less than eighth-grade learning abilities and/or suffer the tragedy of functional illiteracy."
We have begun by expanding the use of Stanford Achievement Tests from testing grades four and eight to testing grades three to 11.
The results should serve as a benchmark from which to measure progress and establish academic accountability.
I commend the state school board members, Dr. Thomas Ingram and state department of Education staff and especially all teachers, counselors, and principals for giving the tests on such short notice.
I know it wasn't easy, but your effort enables us to improve schools in September of 1995 instead of September of 1996.
The seven fundamentals of a good school are well-known and time-tested: 1) Reestablish teachers' authority in the classroom by the use of corporal punishment, expulsions or other acceptable means of discipline.
2) Establish a core curriculum in academics that requires basic subject matter courses such as arithmetic, reading, geography, English, history, math and science.
3) Implement a grading system that accurately measures a student's knowledge of a given subject and reports progress to parents on a report card.
4) Test new teachers by a nationally-normed teachers exam before certification.
Remove or restrain teachers who do not perform at satisfactory levels.
5) Hold superintendents and principals accountable for measured improvement at SAT scores using 1995 test scores as a benchmark.
Replace management that shows no progress after two full years of intensive guidance and support.
6) Provide full-protection for teachers to control students' behavior, and to protect teachers from harassment and lawsuits from government agencies, individuals or other parties.
7) Adopt a Foundation Program for funding and operations of local schools that meets Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation standards for classroom size, libraries and personnel.
"""We are charged tonight with a genuine 'sense of urgency' to rescue thousands of students who will depart their schools with less than eighth-grade learning abilities and/or suffer the tragedy of functional illiteracy."
The seven fundamentals I have enumerated are inseparable.
One will not stand without the others.
This plan must be implemented by the State Superintendent and State Board of Education.
I believe it will.
We should not have to micro-manage the execution of education policy.
However, I have provided you with a comprehensive plan for K-12 funding and with the academic vital statistics that should enable you to thoroughly examine needs as related to performance and costs in your home districts.
I ask you to approve this plan, and if it is not fully implemented by September of 1996, I ask you for full authority to personally execute the education plan that you approve this session.
Now for the easy part.
I would like to ensure that our schoolchildren travel and attend school in a safe, sound and sanitary environment.
Therefore, I propose a $150-million bond issue that meets critical needs for K-12.
My proposal is designed to eliminate the conditions which are unsafe, unsanitary and which endanger the personal well-being of our students.
Given current financial conditions, we can afford no more at this time.
All projects must meet the critical needs described in order to qualify.
Our goal is clear.
We must provide the opportunity for every student in Alabama public schools to achieve academic excellence according to his or her ability and desire to do so.
"Tonight I ask you to ""help me help the children."
We all want two things: 1) Schools where our children are safe, and 2) Schools where our children achieve to the highest levels of their ability.
I desperately want Alabama schoolchildren literate and prepared to face a more difficult and competitive world than we know.
I have long maintained that money is no panacea for educational problems.
I believe it is a matter of will to make Alabama's schools the best in the nation.
To those representing Alabama universities and junior colleges, hear me out.
Join us.
Your support, your leadership and more than 30 schools of education are essential to the welfare of our children.
Our K-12 programs are in crisis.
We lose one-third of our students as drop-outs.
Those who graduate and enroll in college face academic difficulties.
Some reports have stated that as much as 35 percent of our college course work involves remedial education.
We all have to recognize that at this moment the needs of 720,000 students in K-12 are greater than the immediate needs at other levels of education.
Tonight, when the lights are out and you are reflecting on the opening of this session, will you join me in your hearts in a renewed commitment to eradicate illiteracy?
I have with me a letter to the editor from the Birmingham News dated February 13, 1995.
Let me share it with you tonight.
"Dear Editor: ""The question: Do we need a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in public schools?"
The answer: We already have one.
"After quoting the First Amendment, the letter goes on, ""to simplify the First Amendment, it means that school prayer is none of the government's business."
Also, it cannot do anything to stop us from praying or make us pray.
We can pray if we want.
Our country was born because people wanted to have the right to worship God as they please.
"""There is no doubt in my mined that prayer should be a part of our school activities."
Prayer has always been in our schools and always should be in our schools.
Signed, John Collier of Vestavia Hills Elementary Central.
Young Mr. Collier, a fifth grade student, is right.
John, please stand for a moment and let us thank you for so eloquently stating the truth.
"""I will ask this Legislature to pass a resolution confirming First Amendment rights to pray in schools."
I will issue an executive order to every school board and superintendent in Alabama confirming the First Amendment right to pray in school.
If Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, how could a U. S. Supreme Court, after 174 uninterrupted years of prayer in school, suddenly announce one morning in 1962 that prayer was no longer legal?
They cannot make law, but they did.
And chaos and confusion have followed in the courts and schools.
I will ask this Legislature to pass a resolution confirming First Amendment rights to pray in schools.
I will issue an executive order to every school board and superintendent in Alabama confirming the First Amendment right to pray in school.
And I will ask U. S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and U. S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to pass a joint resolution to send to the U. S. Supreme Court confirming First Amendment rights to pray in the public schools of America.
The economy and job growth within Alabama is good.
We can make it better, by ensuring that tax incentives to new and existing industry are competitive with other states.
Therefore, I will propose amendments that will make our present incentive package workable and keep Alabama competitive, but we won't give away the state.
There is no industry in the state with a better record of investment, productivity, and high-paying jobs than Alabama's coal industry.
Even so, competition from low-wage countries remains a threat to its growth and prosperity.
Therefore, I propose a bill to provide an income tax credit of one dollar per ton to Alabama coal producers for the tonnage increases of one year in excess of prior-year's tonnage.
This is the best of both worlds as this tax incentive helps increase production and it helps increase tax revenue.
I will propose legislation that will protect private property rights from unfair government regulations.
The Private Property Protection Act will require that state and local governments examine the impact on private property before introducing new laws or new regulations which might diminish the value of the property.
This administration will continue to fight against crime.
I propose the Truth in Sentencing Act of 1995.
This legislation will guarantee that the criminal will serve the time he is sentenced and only the judge who sentenced him can release him.
To protect the integrity of our worker's compensation system, I will propose a bill to set up an anti-fraud unit within the worker's Compensation Division of the Department of Industrial Relations.
No new taxes or additional funds are required to implement this proposal.
We have a crisis in public confidence in our judicial system.
Last year more that $6 million was spent on Supreme Court elections alone.
"You may ask, ""Is the integrity of a judge compromised by this commercialization of the bench?"""
I cannot answer that question.
"The more appropriate question is: ""Do the people believe this process produces judges who rule for the public interest or the special interest?"""
"Under the doctrine known to lawyers as ""judicial review,"" the exercise of judicial power has become raw political power, because as few as five justices can change the meaning of the law, alter settled concepts of Constitutional law so as to strike down your legislative statutes, and even place the courts in control of that which our Constitution left to other branches of government under the separation of powers doctrine."
Our Constitution can only be changed by Constitutional amendment.
Why do we have a separation of powers doctrine?
Our Constitution says it best.
"We have a separation of powers doctrine because, and I quote, ""to the end that (ours) may be a government of laws, not of men."
What is the solution to this crisis?
Should we do nothing?
Should we sit back and allow any group the opportunity to spend its way into power?
And then have the process repeat itself again and again?
The answer is no.
Should we solve our current crisis by appointing judges for life as is done with federal judges?
A resounding no.
We must act in two general areas to meet the crisis.
First, we must design a method of judicial selection that permits independence and yet retains a healthy measure of accountability to the public.
Second, we must stop excessive judicial usurpation of the legislative power.
The court must never forget that the role of the judiciary is to make society live by the rules society has made: not to make the rules for society.
"""We have a crisis in public confidence in our judicial system."
Last year more than $6 million was spent on Supreme Court elections alone.
You may ask, 'Is the integrity of a judge compromised by this commercialization of the bench?'
I cannot answer that question.
"The more appropriate question is: 'Do the people believe this process produces judges who rule for the public interest or the special interest?'"""
I am asking you to give the people the right to vote for a Constitutional amendment that would allow all vacancies on the Alabama Supreme Court of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Civil Appeals to be filled by appointment of the governor.
Names of nominees would be submitted by a nominating commission composed of the lieutenant governor, the Speaker of the House, two representatives of the Alabama State Bar, a representative of the Circuit Judges Association and two persons appointed by the governor from the public at large.
This also would allow the people the right to vote for whether an appellate judge should be retained or replaced.
We would rid ourselves of the spectacle of appellate judges raising money to campaign against another candidate.
I also propose legislation dealing with campaign spending in judicial elections.
I submit that lawyers and their clients should have to disclose just how much money they and employees acting under their direction gave to a successful judge or justice.
I propose that in certain instances a judge should not hear a case unless other parties who have not been so heavily involved in the judge's campaign agree in writing to allow the judge to participate.
I believe we should eliminate the risk of judicial usurpation.
Let me give you an example of a judge making law and appropriating state taxes.
I call the case the Judge Reese School Take Over Ruling.
"The judge boasted about it in a campaign ad when he said, and I quote, ""I stood up to the Legislature, when they wanted to delay school reform, I told them to get back to work."
This circuit judge in the heat of a campaign for the supreme Court acted as if he were a Legislature, state school board, and governor, all in one.
He has taken over the schools, and imposed a 225-page experimental education policy, and he has impounded at this hour more than $22 million of ASETF revenue.
What is he going to do with it?
Pay legal fees?
Pay the American Civil Liberties Union?
Pay his hand-picked consultants?
I ask you to join me in curing judicial usurpation.
I offer four proposals to do this.
First, give the people the right to vote for a Constitutional amendment that would restrain the power of judicial review.
In certain instances where the question is so close that at least three justices have dissented, the Legislature and the governor should be able to override the court.
These instances would be limited to when the court holds that a statute violates the Alabama Constitution; draws the line on separation of powers in its favor; and, declares what you intended when you enacted a statute.
When any such question is that close, power should repose in the hands of a majority of the 140 members of this Legislature and not as few as five justices on the Supreme Court.
Second, I also ask that you give the people the right to vote for a Constitutional amendment that gives back to this Legislature the power to impeach judges and justices.
The measure of public accountability available by the existence of this authority was an integral part of our state Constitution until 1972.
We need to restore it.
This amendment would not displace the Judicial Inquiry Commission or the Court of the Judiciary.
Third, I also propose that our Constitution be amended in the area dealing with judicial discipline.
We should put more non-lawyers on the Court of the Judiciary and the Judicial Inquiry Commission.
We should take other steps to ensure sound judicial administration.
give the people the right to vote for a Constitutional amendment that would restrain the power of judicial review.
Finally, I call on the Supreme Court to amend The Canons of Judicial Ethics to condemn personal solicitations for money by any sitting judge or justice and to prevent any judge or justice from participating in the campaign of any other person for judicial office.
I recognize that many good minds are currently studying the entire judicial process and I welcome their input.
"A separate issue of ""Tort Reform"" merits discussion."
"Sweeping proposals that affect the laws of this state in the controversial realm of ""punitive damages"" and related measures affecting civil lawsuits are presently before the U. S. Congress."
Laying to one side my personal view that intrusive federal laws should not dictate tort reform legislation to the states, I see no useful purpose in devoting time and energy at this session of the Legislature to an issue where whatever is done by this body may be overridden by action in Washington.
I respectfully request the distinguished members of the Alabama Supreme Court here with us tonight to advise me if they are not at least in substantial compliance in favor of these reform measures.
I propose a tough ethics bill with teeth.
A bill designed and supported by Speaker Clark, Governor Siegelman, Attorney General Sessions, the Ethics Commission and its director Mr. Mac McArthur, and I believe by an overwhelming majority of the Legislature.
"""The time has come to give the people of Alabama the right to put an issue on the ballot for a statewide referendum vote."
This principle of American democracy has been proven effective down through the years in state after state.
There is no danger of 'mob rule' with a signature threshold of six percent of the general election vote total including two percent of each Congressional District vote total cast in the last governor's election.
I urge you to pass a resolution for a Constitutional amendment to give the people of Alabama the right of initiative and referendum.
They richly deserve it.
The major points of the bill are six-fold: 1) The Ethics Commission may begin investigations on its own if all five commissioners vote to do so.
2) No state official can take a job lobbying for a certain special interest until two years after leaving the state job.
3) Define the difference between a campaign contribution, a bribe, and a gift.
4) Prohibit lobbyists from giving anything to a state official other than a campaign contribution.
5) Provide protection for whistleblowers.
6) Set up a system of fines for minor ethics violations.
This bill, thanks to you, Mr. Speaker, and thanks to you, Governor Siegelman, is at the top of the legislative agenda.
I propose a campaign finance bill that will eliminate the commingling of funds so the name of a campaign contributor and final recipient of the contribution are connected and fully disclosed.
Public disclosure on a timely basis directly linking who gives and who receives is the backbone of any honest campaign finance reform.
The time has come to give the people of Alabama the right to put an issue on the ballot for a statewide referendum vote.
This principle of American democracy has been proven effective down through the years in state after state.
"There is no danger of ""mob rule"" with a signature threshold of six percent of the general election vote total including two percent of each Congressional District vote total cast in the last governor's election."
I urge you to pass a resolution for a Constitutional amendment to give the people of Alabama the right of initiative and referendum.
They richly deserve it.
I have had the pleasure of meeting the legislators elected since I left office in 1983.
I am impressed with your energy, your intellect, and your sense of duty.
I ask that each of us look at the clock and the calendar.
We are 90 days into the last complete legislative and gubernatorial term of the 20th century.
Let us tonight begin the work to ensure that generations of the 21st century will have even greater freedom, opportunity and quality of life.
Is this too noble a goal?
Too lofty a task for the people of Alabama?
I think not.
May we find ourselves at this moment in history worthy of the task.
Thank you.
