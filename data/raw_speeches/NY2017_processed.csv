"thank you thank you thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thank you thank you very very much thank you well it is great to be at UB and let's give Satish Tripathi and Nancy zimpher a big round of applause for their great work really an extraordinary accomplishment all the elected officials who we've worked with so successfully but another round of applause for Mayor Brown County executive Mark Poland Carr's mayor geister mark Schroeder Mayor Sam Teresa and how about that Howard zimsky he had I just read he he did a book Howard came out at about Christmas the sales haven't been great yet but I got an advanced copy of it its title is I always wanted to be Jerry signed but it wound up head of economic development go figure but it is a good read it is a good read it has a sort of schizophrenic twist to it about a man caught in one occupation but he really wanted to be another person certain sexual identity issues in there also but it is it was a good book and he he on a serious note has been such an extraordinary benefit not just to western New York he has turned around all of upstate New York let's give him a big round of applause Howard's empty and I am so excited to be here and to talk about the new year the state of the state which we've been talking about for the past a few days now what is the state of the state this January 9th well it is stronger than it has been in decades and nobody knows that better than you and Buffalo know that we've made remarkable economic and social progress all across the board since the time of FDR and Robert Moses our government has achieved more it's built more it's passed more meaningful legislation than ever before it really has been an extraordinary 60 years in terms of progress especially when you compare it to the preceding decades of stagnation statewide the unemployment went from 8.4 percent to 5.1 today and the good news is you see that economic recovery all across the state it used to be that downstate New York would do very well economically and upstate New York would lag and we have changed that because we focused much more on upstate New York and now when you look at the growth numbers in upstate New York you see they are all across the state and they're comparable with what you're seeing in downstate it's extraordinary that the growth in the North Country for example would be better than the growth in Manhattan so it really is a testament to a new balanced approach that is working across the entire state in the state of New York today we have just under 8 million private-sector jobs those that is more private sector jobs than have ever existed in the state of New York that's what eight million jobs represent western New York 23900 new jobs since 2010 so we are making dramatic progress but the progress didn't just happen we took dramatic action six years ago we really headed in a much different course the truth was the state was on a spending spree and it had been for many many years when you go back 50 years and you look at the rate of spending in the state the state was spending at a higher rate of increase then the people in the state were earning income alright just think about that for a second literally the government was spending more than its people were earning and that's why there was that constant feeling that government was taking more and more of your paycheck you know why because government was taking more and more of your paycheck and what we did fundamentally was we got the spending of the state under control and during the times going back to Governor Rockefeller the state spent about 11% more every year Governor Kerry 7.9 my father 6.9 George Pataki Republican conservative was elected to correct the spending of Mario Cuomo democratic liberal the difference was one point seven we have brought the spending for six years than to one point four percent now when you get that spending down a lot of good things happen and when you get to spending down then you can cut taxes and the taxes for every person in the state of New York at every rate are lower today than they were five years ago lowest middle-class tax rate since 1947 lowest manufacturer attack since 1917 which is zero lowest corporate tax since 1968 so we got the spending down it allowed us to get the taxes down and that's why you see a new attitude where businesses believe they're welcome in New York families believe they're welcome in New York the exodus has stopped the job growth has started and we also shook up Albany on a different level and we shook them up to the fact that upstate actually matters the truth is the legislature in Albany all too often focuses too much on downstate why because that's where most of them are elected from that's the single largest concentration density of population in the state I understand that I'm from down in New York I understand the concept but upstate New York actually has greater needs than downstate New York and at the end of the day upstate downstate we are one state we are one set of books and not to give up state that the attention and help it deserves never made any sense so we started with a new approach where we invested in upstate New York to an exponential extent from past years and we changed the way we did it the old way was Albany bureaucrats and politicians said this is what I want to spend money on in Buffalo this is what I want to spend money on in Syracuse so it is really more political pork-barrel and political payoffs than anything else we put together regional economic development councils which are the top businesspeople in each region working with the top academic people in each region and we said to them you give us a business plan that actually makes sense for that region and then we will follow what your plan says rather than the politicians in Albany tell you what you think they should do it was a totally different approach now the legislature doesn't like it because they liked it when they got to make the decisions but what politicians do what politicians do let business leaders and academic leaders do what they do let them design the business plan for the region because it's about creating jobs that's what this is all about and that's what these re DC's have done extraordinarily well and it is working we have invested 4.6 billion dollars in these regional economic development councils we've created 210 thousand jobs and in western New York we made a special commitment why western New York I believe we had a commitment to make up for years of abandonment and years of inaction you know I first came to Buffalo when I was in my 20s my father was governor I was working with a fella named Tim Russert who was a good buddy of mine who was working with my father also is my father's press secretary and he was the first person who used to bring me out to Buffalo and we would always come out on official business that's why we took the plane and we would do our official business and then we would have some unofficial events and he showed me Buffalo and only a way that Tim Russert could show somebody Buffalo but it had such potential always and such a great workforce in such a great ethic in such a great history and it got caught in an economic transition and really the state government was never there to help but people never gave up in Buffalo and that's what was always extraordinary to me I mean the economic transition has been going on since the 50s the 60s 70s 80s 90s and people never gave up they stayed because they believed in Buffalo and when I became governor I committed myself to making a difference and making up for the lack of state energy and state investment in Buffalo and we did and that's what the Buffalo billion was all about it was a billion dollars why a billion a billion to say to people this is not just another plan and I'm not just another politician with another plan because you've heard I politicians with a lot of plans over a lot of years and over 30 40 years of decline every time a new mayor every time a new county executive every time a new governor was elected he gave me said I'm gonna help Buffalo really believe me believe me I'm gonna help Buffalo yeah you had your heart broken once and you had your heart broken twice and your heart broken three times and it was hard to believe again so I said we needed something to really capture people's attention because they have to believe that it's going to work if it's going to work so we said the Buffalo billion who not only did it rhyme billion is a serious number and it got people's attention and it gave us that little opening where people open their heart and they're open their mind to say you know what maybe this is different and then we went to work once that you had that window of potential and that window of hope and the progress has been amazing if anyone said to you five years ago we would have the growth that we had today I would have said to them you're being way overly optimistic it's impossible you can't reverse 50 years of economic decline in five years it's not going to happen you can't do it that fast but we did highest wage growth in Buffalo in 36 years nearly four decades 22% increase in construction from jobs from 2010 to 2015 highest since they've been keeping numbers home sales up 11% some with some of the highest records in 2015 and home prices have increased close to 20% since 2011 just think of that the state has spent 150 million dollars to promote tourism which sounds like a lot of money and it is but it is paying dividends our tourism spending is now up to a hundred and two billion dollars in economic impact and again you see the growth in tourism is all across the state western New York were close to 14% and it's been great for all of western New York 18 million tourists up 14% since 2010 18 million and we're going to do even better than that next year 2.8 billion dollars more than 57,000 jobs up 11% that's the I Love New York campaign the taste of New York campaign all that advertising has really turned around tourism canalside has been a phenomenal success people are now coming from all across the country to study canalside for the great success that it is ten times as many visitors since 2010 we have companies coming to Buffalo that would have been unimaginable a few years ago if I told you Tesla was coming and Panasonic was coming you would have said it's too good to be true but they're here Millennials are coming back after so many years of seeing young people leave after so many years have seen that same scene at the airport with sons leaving and daughters leaving to follow jobs that were somewhere else now it's actually reversed and young people are coming back to Buffalo and they want to live in the city and they want to live in that social environment new hotels in Niagara Falls who would have believed Riverbend former steel plant is now the location of the largest solar panel fact facility in the Western Hemisphere 43 North has been a national innovation in entrepreneurial and entrepreneurism Buffalo billion is working on every level it's working you look at the numbers you look at the experience it's working and since we so much progress in such a short period of time the real question is where do we go from here because the dramatic success that was unimaginable only speaks to the potential that we actually have now we know what one thing we have to do we have to continue to focus on the economy and we especially have to focus on the economy for the middle class and working class they have been especially hard hit not just in Buffalo but all across this country and that has to be our focus so today I'm proposing a middle-class Recovery Act that those three things focuses on jobs and infrastructure education and lower taxes on jobs and infrastructure it's all about embracing the new innovation economy and it starts with something as simple as embracing ride-sharing ride-sharing large sharing is creating thousands of jobs it's promoting safety for passengers it's making transportation less expensive it's it's helpful for people who go out and may have a few drinks it's actually safer for a drunk from a drunk driving point of view it makes total sense however it's not allowed in upstate New York because it requires a vote of the legislature but meanwhile it is allowed in downstate New York this is one of those examples my friends where is a just an unfair duality if it makes sense for downstate it makes sense for upstate upstate is left out it's thousands of jobs it's more tourism it's cost savings it's unfair to leave out upstate because remember upstate matters and that's what I want you to tell your legislators when they come home don't come home to Buffalo unless you pass ride-sharing for upstate New York to drive the economy we need to invest in infrastructure as part of a hundred billion dollar investment in infrastructure we're doing ten thousand miles of roads 2,600 bridges Niagara Falls we relocated renamed the Niagara scenic Parkway 30 million for the Scourge aquata express way to reunite a long divided community that should have been done decades ago since 2012 we've invested 1.6 billion in western New York infrastructure Route 219 bridge which we blew up which was very cool by the way and finally finally finally we have made the a transformation of the Peace Bridge Plaza and we didn't go to war with Canada over it either the next step in infrastructure is going to be protecting our water system we have two problems on the water system we have an old infrastructure and they're actually health hazards in our water system because we did a lot of manufacturing for a lot of years there are a lot of toxins in the earth which wind up in the groundwater which have to be filtered especially for young children they're at risk we need to take immediate action I want to spend two billion dollars to rebuild our water infrastructure across the state we want to fund state-of-the-art drinking water treatment systems that that filter out all potential chemicals that could be toxic and dangerous failing infrastructure pipes and protect drinking water at its source I want local communities to work together to come up with the best most cost efficient way to do it and project that plan to the state access to education is probably one of the most important things that we're going to do this session and I think it's one of the most forward-looking reforms a generation ago all you needed was a high school diploma and you really could lead a middle-class life if you were willing to work hard and you went to high school you could find a manufacturing job and you could do well and you could take care of your family and you would work your way up the ladder that is not true anymore 3.5 million jobs will require college by 2020 for you need a college education to compete for most middle-class jobs the jobs that are coming back and there are jobs that are coming back why because a lot of corporations moved overseas because they wanted cheap labor and what happened was they found out that you get what you pay for because they went overseas they got cheap labor they're coming back because they want educated labor everything is about advanced manufacturing and advanced manufacturing is not manufacturing the way it was its manufacturing with the mind I was in Tonawanda at the new GM engine plant where they rolled out a 300 million dollar transformation for new engine construction and walking through the plant all new engines being built you know what I didn't see tools no wrenches no screwdrivers it's all automation and somebody at a computer terminal who is moving the automation it is about the education and the the place that is going to get those jobs that's coming back from overseas is going to be the place that has the most educated workforce the the people who are gonna do best are gonna be the people who are most educated and college is going to be today what high school was 75 years ago that's what college is so everybody should have a college education one problem it is very very expensive and a lot of people can't afford it and a lot of people can't afford the debt which is staggering you start with about $30,000 in debt average in the state of New York that's why I want to lead the nation on a proposal whose time will come but New York always gets there first we should have tuition free college in our state for families who are making $125,000 or less because that is the future way we pay for high school we should say the day has come that we will now pay for college and let New York have the most educated workforce in the country thank you thank you thank you thank you in western New York 85% of the families will cop qualify for tuition free public college this is a game-changer this will say to every child in every home I have the hope to go to college I have the hope to go to college doesn't matter that mom and dad can't pay doesn't matter that I come from a poor place can go to college and if I can go to college I can be a success every child's eyes will be open every child's future will be open hope for everyone and that's what this country is supposed to be all about somewhere along the way we lost our way but New York is gonna put us back on track and this is the proposal that is going to do at the same time we're going to lower taxes we're going to focus once again on property taxes why median income tax for the state of New York for most people is $1,800 property tax is forty seven hundred dollars two and a half times to pay to the state you're upset about paying taxes don't be upset at me two and a half times is local property taxes we pay some of the highest property taxes in the United States of America and Westchester Nassau Suffolk in dollar amount pay the highest but as a percentage of home value upstate New York pays the highest property taxes have to come down well that's just you Andrew Cuomo no it's not it's also another fella named FDR who said the increase in real estate taxes do wholly to the increase in the cost of local and not state government these taxes on real estate or too high local government has many communities become guilty of great waste and duplication that that my friends is what we're going to attack and that is what we're going to have to change we passed a 2% property tax cap a few years ago that has worked great because it capped the growth of property taxes to 2% they were going up 7 8 9 percent it saved homeowner 16 billion dollars one point three six billion in western New York typical homeowner has saved 21 hundred dollars from the property tax cap but we want to go a step further and we want to have local governments work together to find the efficiencies that you have had to find in your house and I have had to find in my house and every family has had to find in their household budget and income it's time government is as responsible with your money as the families of New York have to be and we're going to make that happen this year I also proposed further relief in a middle-class child care tax credit more than two hundred thousand families will see their tax benefits more than double on an average our middle-class Recovery Act will impact the entire state but then we also need to think regionally why because the old approach to economic development was it looked at the entire state and you had one economic development plan for the whole state we realized you don't really have one economy in New York State New York State is very different Long Island is different in the North Country and the North Country is different than western New York and what you really need to do is focus region by region and develop regional economies and that's what we've been doing and the Buffalo billion strategy was that regional focus on steroids my question in December was we basically came to the end of the Buffalo billion program we did very very well we exceeded expectations what's next where do we go from here Buffalo billion one is done what's the direction forward and it was in December and I was looking for inspiration I was looking for answers and I did know way to go so to find the answer I went to the three wise men I went first to Commissioner Howard's em ski and mayor Byron brown and county executive Marc Bolan cars and I said to them please wise men tell me where is the future of western New York and what do we do after Buffalo billion one and how do we continue the growth and their answer was as the book says we look to the East for help [Applause] I said thank you very much I needed that but it puts back on me so then I want to find two other men and I said oh I'm sorry Commissioner Howard zimsky also added another pithy comment which is pass over so I can get off this camel which is so Howard by the way but just to be sure I wanted to ask two other wise men what we should do okay so uh okay so I asked Niagara Falls mayor died stir and I asked Jamestown mayor Sam Theresa what do you think the future holds and they say look to the north and look to the south because we need help too Sam actually looks good on that camel dye star also said if you pass super can I get Sam skis camel coz em ski has a good looking camel we put it all together and we design Buffalo billion squared we call it Buffalo billion squared because it takes Buffalo billion one and it takes Buffalo billion two and there's a synergy between the two of them that will be exponential and that's why it's Buffalo billion squared the principles of it are going to be to build on Western New York's Renaissance what you've accomplished already help more small businesses and downtown areas strategically invest in regional industries first proposal grow tourism it is a growth industry for us it is working great you saw that in the numbers we're going to open a tourism Visitor Center on Grand Island we opened one in Long Island it is working great and we're going to open one on Grand Island proposal to is support the extension of buffalos light rail to ram her which will directly connect the tens of thousands of jobs the light rails extension to the DL NW railroad terminal will spur development and reinvigorate the cobblestone district Buffalo billion one did a lot of great work in the inner and outer harbor we want to build on that at the outer harbor will leverage open space recreational activities by creating a visited center bike path and redeveloping the Michigan pier we will establish the Buffalo blue way to increase waterfront access by building 18 new docks boat launches and establishing guides for visitors Buffalo billion squared also says while we've been focusing on generating the economy and high-tech jobs and advanced manufacturing jobs it's also important to make sure everyone is sharing in the success because the greatest feast has the largest number of people at the table and the greatest success is shared success so we want to make sure every community is part of this Renaissance Buffalo [Music] to revitalize Buffalo's East Side will establish commercial corridors and underutilized land to promote new community growth will move the Buffalo manufacturing works the Buffalo's East Side which will bring jobs to the East Side we will invest ten million dollars to clean up the zombie property issue and homesteading to revive and reinvent blighted areas on the east side and in Cheektowaga mark Poland cars has been talking for a long time' but the about the Bethlehem Steel site will transform one thousand acres into a new industrial park for advanced manufacturing so we'll start to reuse that land ten million dollars for a workforce development plan to support job growth and ensure that we have the workforce that can meet the jobs that we're creating we will bring in to say yes to education program that has done magnificent work all across upstate New York but it continues to prepare student to transition from high school to higher ed and lets them know they'll have a college education if they make it through we'll invest in the Buffalo Niagara campus to catalyze Western New York's burgeoning life science industry which has already made great strides will acquire underutilized property in downtown Niagara Falls so we can free up that land that has been locked up for too long and actually have productive commercial activity developed on it that brings economic growth we're going to reclaim 135 acres of the Niagara Gorge corridor preserving the rich ecology in the largest expansion of green space since the days of Olmstead part of the gorge belongs to NYCHA we committed 1 million dollars for conservation to that section of it we will complete the ecological restoration of the gorge and we also understand that we need to generate more activities for tourists on the Niagara Falls side of the Falls when you're looking for us the river you see Canada has more activities we need to correct that and we're gonna do it in Niagara Falls on Goat Island we will create a year-round destination for tourism and build a world-class Lodge with sweeping views of the Niagara River ESD will also be issuing an RFP to build greater outdoor activities on Goat Island that will boost tourism and give people an international destination to visit so we're very excited about that in Jamestown we're gonna leverage the cultural history and we will invest five million dollars to close the gap on the Lucille Ball comedy Center we think it's going to be a great tourist attraction we want to be part of it and congratulations mayor Theresa we will also provide 2.5 million dollars to help the city of Jamestown regain its economic stability while doing the build we'll be doing that also as part of this plan and we've had a successful downtown revitalization initiative program that we've run before Western New York has many older downtown areas in many of its towns and we want to have a downtown revitalization specific plan for places like Alfred parent Center East Aurora etc to revitalize those downtown areas we'll be running it as a competition but we'll fund it through Buffalo billion - now why why are we committed to Buffalo and why are we doubling down on our investment well first I believe in the three wise men they have done a really extraordinary job for all of us I also believe in the other two wise men I believe in the leadership of Buffalo I believe in Buffalo's growth and I believe in Buffalo's potential most of all I believe in the people of Buffalo and I'll end where I started since I was coming here as a young man the strength of the people of Buffalo the loyalty the intelligence the determination the values the family values the work values the education values the ethic has been so impressive to me and the way that you have responded and the resilience that you have shown when the state came with this investment you made this happen you made this happen there wasn't me it wasn't how exempt ski it wasn't Byron brown and wasn't mark poling cars the people of Buffalo and their love of Buffalo and Jamestown and Niagara Falls their commitment to Western New York where they said I'm not giving up and we're not gonna fail this is my home this is the Queen City and she's coming back and we're not stopping until she does that commitment that energy that force is what I believe and that's each and every person in this room and you have that you have proven it over and over again so I am going to propose in my budget that the state fund the Buffalo billion plan in total and accepts all 20 proposals which will be five hundred million dollars but I believe it's an investment in the City of Buffalo and the state of New York and it will pay dividends and I am proud to advance this and if we work together we will make it a reality and I believe the best is yet to be in Buffalo and you ain't seen nothing yet thank you god bless you"
