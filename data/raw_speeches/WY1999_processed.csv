SENTENCES
"Fellow elected officials, members of the Judiciary, special guests -Thank you, Speaker Bebout and President Twiford, for your hospitality and courtesy."
I congratulate each of you on your leadership positions in the House and Senate and wish you each a successful tenure as you preside over the 55th session of the Wyoming Legislature.
Congratulations to each of you who have been elected by the people of your districts.
I’m honored to join you in this House Chamber.
"Sixteen years ago I came to this chamber as a freshman legislator, fascinated by the ornate architecture, humbled by the responsibility given me by my constituents, and eager to do the people’s work."
"Today, on this, my fifth report to you and to the people of Wyoming on the condition of our state, I stand, as your Governor, just as fascinated, just as humbled, just as eager to get on with the people’s work, as I’m sure all of you in the Legislature are."
The Legislature is a great institution.
The friends you make will be among the best you’ll ever have.
No matter what your philosophy might be- you are entitled to special respect from being elected to serve Wyoming.
"From my twelve years in the Legislat ure, I offer these suggestions - Always take the issue seriously, but never yourself."
"Be critical of an approach, but never of a person."
Remember that principles are important and partisanship is not.
My obligation as Governor is to advise you on the condition of the State of Wyoming and to make recommendations for changes that will benefit our people.
I am pleased to offer my recommendations and the support of the executive branch to help you in yourwork and in your deliberations.
Wyoming is what America was - and what America ought to be.
We are the last best place to live.
"We are the state of high altitudes, low multitudes - and great attitudes!"
"We are blessed with many natural energy resources in Wyoming, but what really counts is the energy of our citizens."
"We have world class reserves of oil, gas, coal, uranium and wind."
We are the headwaters of our nation’s rivers and streams that support hydroelectric power.
"But, while these energy sources fuel the economy of our nation, they are no match for the energy of Wyoming’s people!"
The energy within creates the enthusiasm we feel!
Our challenge is to prepare for a future we can barely begin to imagine - yet keep the qualities that we would never give up.
"We will develop the services we need and an economy that grows so that our children can prosper here, and we can encourage our former residents to come back home The Economy Back in the mid-eighties, we weathered an agriculture crisis as bad as the Great Depression."
"Today our ag community faces the lowest commodity prices experienced in a generation while the mineral industry, particularly the oil patch, has the lowest prices in fifty years."
"Over the years, Wyoming has seen hardships as well as bounty, economic uncertainty as well as prosperity, natural disaster as well as nature’s benevolence."
The heart and soul of our state has been tried and tested.
And we will come back yet again!
"The resilience of our people reinvigorates and renews, seasons and strengthens."
"Wyoming’s story is: ""Good timber does not grow with ease."
"The stronger the wind, the stronger the trees."
"When the wind dies down, we’ll stand together stronger and taller than ever before."
"And, there is good news in our economy: In 1998, the unemployment rate stayed at four percent."
This rate is half of what the rate was during the so-called “boom years” of the 1980s.
The most recent Wyoming Labor Force Trends Report notes that there were over 7800 new jobs created by start up businesses in 1997.
The average monthly employment for second quarter 1998 was nearly 5000 jobs higher than the year before.
"Of the twelve major industry sectors, only state and federal government had a decrease in employment.All others increased."
"In 1998, we had over seventy percent fewer people on welfare than four years ago."
"And, over two-thirds of former welfare recipients are working in Wyoming."
Child support collections are twice the national average and Wyoming has received national recognition for our collection system.
"In 1998, property valuation increased to levels not seen for fifteen years.That’s a mixed bag though."
It also means property taxes went up.
"For the third consecutive year, in 1998, we reduced Workers’ Compensation premiums."
This adds over $30 million per year back into the pockets of our businesses and significantly reduces the unfunded liability of previous years.
"The Wyoming Equality Network has begun to connect our schools, hospitals, and communities to each other and the world."
"On behalf of all our Wyoming citizens, I thank you and your predecessors for working together to make this economic news good.But our job is not complete."
"As we stand on the threshold of a new century, we face challenges."
We need more and better trained workers in a growing economy.
We need schools with higher standards to educate our children.
We need to continue to encourage and support community based service delivery.
We need to protect our citizens from the few who break our laws and threaten our communities.
We need to enhance our economic competitive advantage to ensure long-term growth.
We need improved air service to our communities.
We need help for our troubled oil industry.
You will consider legislation that would allow the state to ease the financial burdens on those industries during low prices and be reinstated when times get better.
"We need technology enhanced communities to provide better jobs, enhanced health care access, education and government services."
We need greater return on state investments to avoid further tax increases.
"Last week, your five statewide elected officials went to five communities around the state as a part of Inauguration Week events."
"Joe, Max, Cynthia, Judy and I visited five communities to symbolize that we serve people where they are, not just where government is."
We saw just a few of the best programs and places that Wyoming offers.
Evanston has solid master plans in place for community renewal and economic vision.
"They have built partnerships with organizations, both public and private."
Lander has exceptional teachers who devote themselves to helping children discover the joys of learning.
They have excelled in integrating the School/University Partnership.
Riverton has a career planning program that helps students take charge of their lives and develop plans that support their future goals.
Judy and I made a joint announcement with the Superintendent of St. Stephens School for an innovative School to Careers Program.
"The town of Jackson has shown us all how a community can turn out to help abused women find safety, security and people who care."
Sheridan College is developing an innovative technology center to help teachers become masters of their profession.
Sheridan has also shown us how the best and brightest of our young people can build a world-wide fuel distribution company and operate it entirely through communications and technology.
"And the same community has shown how the basic industry of timbering can be innovative, efficient and profitable in the worst of circumstances."
"Yes, Wyoming is a state rich in resources, and the most enduring resource is the resource of the mind, the indomitable spirit that won’t settle for less than success!"
We truly have the energy within!
Wyoming can and will have economic growth.
It’s not a matter of whether we will grow.
It’s only a matter of when and how much.
"The partnerships we created during the last session that led to the creation of a new, bold initiative, the Wyoming Business Council, are the partnerships we need to continue to use to finish the job."
Education Several local and national articles have commented on the need to rank our schools based upon quality and performance.I strongly agree.
But what are the common sense building blocks for a new educational system that will prepare our state for the 21st century?
It’s empowering teachers to do what they do best- to teach our children.
It’s empowering our communities to take charge.It’s requiring accountability.
Our schools are still structured on a model suited for a time that is past – not one prepared to meet the challenges of the future.
Our Wyoming school kids should have access to the education they’ll need to succeed in life.
"We can help with new structures, new technology, new formulas for funding and professional development."
"Our quality of education must come through standards that parents expect, teaching skills that business needs, and meeting the expectations that students have."
"And, we need to support our teachers who are the pioneers of education revolution."
I challenge all in education to leverage the power of learning through non-traditional as well as traditional means of teaching.
"Our focus needs to be on competency, not seat time."
Children need education that is learned and not just taught.
Give students the chance for discovery.
Knowledge gained through discovery is exciting and enduring.
Students who learn to take the initiative in the classroom are much more self-motivated in the workplace.
Technology can enable discovery.
"Innovative schools, such as Charter Schools, can and should give parents and students a choice."
"We can and should pay our teachers as professionals, and in turn, should expect the profession to rid itself of those who do n’t measure up."
"We need incentives that reward teaching effectiveness, better coordination of resources and programs, increased public understanding and adaptability to changing demands."
We must develop assessment programs that allow us to measure competency by demonstration and to evaluate student achievement regardless of the source of the knowledge.
Wyoming citizens deserve to know how their students and schools are doing in comparison to the competition.
"I am most concerned for our small schools, the heart of our small towns and communities."
"I strongly support legislative changes that would phase out the quarter mile limit on small schools, would fund school activities in small schools and designate that districts of 1350 students or less receive a small district adjustment."
Each of these changes have been designed to fit within the cost based finance formula and validated by our consultants.
The result of the Supreme Court decision of three years ago has been mixed.
The decision has moved us toward clearer standards and put us on the road to meaningful reform.
"However, Wyoming stands alone in having the most complex system of school finance in America, dictated by the Court in a way that makes it costly to administer and difficult to apply."
"I still believe in quality education, measured results, and fiscal accountability."
"I’ll say it again, it’s time to get out of the courtroom and back into the classroom!"
Workforce We need to link education and business opportunities to make the best of our state investment in education.
A well-trained and educated work force is a competitive advantage for Wyoming.
Several companies who have chosen Wyoming as their place to do business did so either because of our existing workforce or because we were willing to pay for worker training as an added incentive for them to come here.
Population trends in Wyoming are very much like the national trend.
"With the passing of the baby-boom “echo,” we have fewer kids in the lower grades."
That means that we will face a continuing trend of fewer children in our public schools and in our higher education system over the next several years.
"But, while traditional, on-campus enrollment projections for Wyoming’s community colleges and the University of Wyoming may be declining, we will have an increasing demand for our institutions to create and deliver education and training in new ways."
This will require that our University and our community colleges deliver education and training that can be brought to the workplace or allow the working student to take the course at home rather than on campus.
"We must change the focus from the supplier to the recipient, to put the focus on the student and society."
"Back in 1995, I issued an executive order creating the Workforce Development Council to make sense out of a hodgepodge of training, vocational and worker programs."
"The council had to be performance driven, focused on demand, not supply, include all agencies that might affect worker training and be effective."
The Workforce Act of 1998 at the federal level has finally responded to what we want to do in Wyoming.
We can now provide better services more effectively with greater chances of success and for less funding than before.
Wyoming is one of the first states that is prepared to comply with the federal act.
I need your support for the Wyoming State Plan and approval for an employer voucher program that is very similar to the plan you authorized last year.
No other state is as ready as we are to implement the program.
Employers and businesses need higher skill levels and education for our workers.
"To be successful, Wyoming businesses must find new markets, productive niches or other kinds of competitive advantage."
More and more of these niches are in information andtechnology areas.
Business must rely on intellectual strength rather than the traditional physical strength of the workforce.
Even the most routine tasks in our future economy will require significant use and understanding of technology.
Higher Education We must adopt a different approach to post secondary education.
Our campuses have traditionally delivered education from their physical location.
"Higher education needs to be available anywhere, anytime and not just on campus."
That’s the only way some of our businesses will be able to keep pace.
"Just last Wednesday, the state community colleges and the Community College Commission entered into a compact to share information on worker training courses."
"Our community colleges, our university, and even our high schools must embrace innovation focused upon results and community needs."
Perhaps most important for higher education in Wyoming is the urgent need to change how we develop new teachers and provide for continuing professional growth.
Revenue Outlook The latest revenue forecast shows that we are over $70 million better off than at the close of the Legislative session last March.
We begin this session with unallocated revenues that amount to about 10% of the state’s budget - a highly respectable situat ion.
The near- term surplus is overshadowed by the prospect of long-term deficits.
"If our public schools continue to be funded at current levels, we face a $50M shortfall each year beginning in the year 2001."
The funding increases contained in Senate File 39along with maintenance and construction commitments will only add to the anticipated shortfall.
"Overall, government operations will remain fairly flat."
Commitments to education and corrections will drive any budget increases.
Our revenue system needs an overhaul in order to meet future needs.
The Tax Reform 2000 Commission has given us a preliminary report.
Now we need public debate on future tax policy.
"But, I suggest we devote our energy to a menu of options and set aside any that don’t really have a future."
People need to be reassured that we are spending their tax money in the most efficient and productive way possible.
Let’s work together to produce an expenditure study that analyzes not just where the taxpayer’s money goes but how effectively it is spent.
I ask again for your support for Strategic Planning and Performance Based Budgeting.
"We should be able to set priorities, assign resources to those priorities, and then decide whether the expenditure is appropriate."
I believe there is no other alternative if we are to be accountable to Wyoming’s taxpayers.
"I support the initiatives of our new State Treasurer, Cynthia Lummis in her goal to improve state investment income by at least one percentage point."
"The legislation you have, that adopts the prudent investor rule, will help us avoid unnecessary tax increases."
"Children and Families While we believe health care is the primary responsibility of each individual or the family, we recognize that we must continue to support community based health services, especially for children."
We remain committed to improving health care in Wyoming by improving health provider recruitment and retention.
We will look to the technology of telemedicine to enhance our existing medical assets and provide expanded access to health care.
Our highest goal is still to prevent illness and injury while we deal with the crisis of the moment more effectively.
There are many health care issues that will be before you for debate this session.
Giving our children the best possible start in life is critical to the long term health of our state.
"Early childhood, birth to age three, is the most critical time for development of mental, physical and emotional health."
These early years build the foundation for successful youth and healthy adults.
"Last year, I appointed an Early Childhood Development Council."
"They have completed an initial strategic plan and have outlined the goal to “develop a quality, coordinated system which enhances the potential of Wyoming’s children,” a goal that we must all work together to achieve."
"By age three, three-fourths of a child’s brain is developed."
"By the fourth grade, we can predict with great certainty whether a child will succeed or fail."
Proper development will lead to a productive adult.
"Without nurturing, that lack of development can result in a juvenile delinquent and an unemployable adult."
Early childhood stimulation and nutrition are more important than ever.
The role of a parent is even more significant.
State government can’t guarantee every child a good family.
But we can help Wyoming’s families and schools give our children the building blocks for success in life.
This is not a new government program- it is a new way of thinking and a better way to deliver programs to make sure children get a good start in life.
During this session you will address three critical initiatives that can enhance the potential of Wyoming’s children and youth.
The first is the proposed Children’s Health Insurance Program or KidCare.
"In 1997, your nation’s governors convinced the Congress to pass landmark legislation allowing states to develop health insurance programs for low income uninsured children."
The bill you will consider is a compromise bill.
It brings together a conservative expansion of a state program and an innovative voucher program run by the private sector.
I support moving ahead with this approach.
I appreciate the work and leadership of the committee on the KidCare issue.
The second important initiative is the methamphetamine initiative.
You have heard much about the scourge of this drug.
Meth poses a dangerous threat to our youth and to our state.This is real.
"The impact upon the court system, the correctional system , and the health care system is tremendous."
"Last year, you considered funding a statewide initiative."
"This year, we are again proposing an aggressive approach bringing state and local authorities together to tackle this threat head on."
"I say loud and clear to those who engage in this type of business - Dealing meth, in this state, will not be tolerated."
We will do whatever it takes to put drug dealers and manufacturers behind bars and out of business.
The damage that meth does is tremendous.
But research shows that there is effective treatment.
The costs are less and the outcomes are better than simply putting the user behind bars without treating the problems and reducing the demand for drugs.
People regain their lives and we regain productive citizens.
The proposal before you is focused on results.
We must win this battle for our children and for our state.
"The third health initiative deals with reducing tobacco consumption, especially by our youth."
"The recently announced Tobacco Settlement would yield Wyoming’s share at $486M paid in relatively equal amounts over a 25 year period, provided that there is a reduction in tobacco use by kids."
I recommend that you designate a special account to set apart the funds until priorities for expenditure are set.
"I further recommend that health care, particularly for young people, and programs for wellness, for early intervention, and for disease prevention, be the target for funding."
"Healthy Communities Our communities and neighborhoods are not only where we find solutions for health care but also for juvenile justice, reducing drug use, ending domestic violence, preventing child abuse and other issues."
Sherri and I will continue to work to give new strength to our communities through the most effective government we have in Wyoming - our volunteers.
"We should all take a turn at giving something back, to encourage others and give meaning to the place we call home."
I know of no better way to deal with bias or animosity than to bring people together to accomplish a community service task.
The legislation being proposed to deal with bias crimes or hate will have limited effect if there isn’t a change of heart or increased understanding.
The brutal murder of Matthew Shepard last October shocked us and shocked the nation.
Our approach should be one that treats everyone the same under the law.
We continue plans to provide community based mental health care through the Mental Health Partnership and the Select Committee on Mental Health.
Last month we extended our landmark agreement of cooperation to deliver community based mental health services to again avoid costly and unproductive litigation.
The Department of Family Services has two major program changes that I support.
I recommend that the Girls School receive additional monies to keep pace with an increase in placements.
I also support the implementation of the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act.
Public Safety We will work to effectively and safely manage offenders in and out of prison.
I call your attention to a most encouraging trend in the Intensive Treatment Unit at the Wyoming State Penitentiary.
"Of the 98 graduates of this program of residential substance abuse treatment, only 18 have returned."
This is a solid 72% success rate to date - much higher than the nationwide average of 45%.
I support the legislation that would allow the development of prison industries.
This will effectively provide training in vocational/industries for offenders to increase or develop work ethics and job skills to ensure the likelihood of employment upon release.
"More importantly, it includes the opportunity for the offender to make restitution for the crime committed."
"I strongly support Restorative Justice principles that look first to public safety and punishment for the crime, but then move on to rehabilitatio n and victim restitution."
"State Employees The state continues to lose quality employees, largely because of better pay and benefits elsewhere."
"This year, insurance premiums and deductibles were increased."
I support legislation that would cover these additional costs to state employees.
"In addition, I strongly support legislation that will bring state employee salaries to market level.My message is clear."
Our state employees add value to Wyoming!!
State employees are the principle reason that we will resolve the software problems associated with the Year 2000.
Many agencies have already upgraded software.
Nearly one-third of all programs are now compliant.
Our goal is to ensure there is no disruption of vital service to Wyoming citizens.
Natural Resources I support funding for brucellosis testing by our cattle producers caused by mandates imposed by the federal government.
This funding brings much needed relief to a troubled industry.
Livestock producers are also suffering from predator losses.
I support an increase in predator control funds contingent upon having the Department of Agriculture and the Game and Fish Department develop a coordinated plan for predator control.
The Department of Environmental Quality has been unable to keep current with the increased number of requests for permits dealing with air quality and land quality while working to enforce agreements with AMOCO over hazardous waste cleanup in Casper.
The most significant increase in permit requests has been from the unprecedented interest in producing coal bed methane in the Powder River Basin.
I am requesting an increase in personnel for the short term so that permits can be issued in a timely manner.
I also support requiring AMOCO to cover the state’s costs of clean up at their old Casper refinery over the next five years.
The DEQ Small Business Outreach Office has been very supportive of our small businesses who want to comply with state law but don’t have the time or the expertise to know what to do.
The Board of Equalization has become mired in such a backlog of appeals that it is affecting general business certainty and the State’s ability to maintain tax collection and administration.
I am supporting services to aid the Board in reducing the backlog of appeals.
I support the new statewide water planning process in the Omnibus Water Bill.
The planning process will determine the needs for economic growth.
The new effort will be closely integrated with the Wyoming Business Council and provide certainty that the c apacity of infrastructure will be enough to meet demands for new Wyoming businesses and industry.
Local participation will be included to develop spending priorities and state water policy.
"We will continue to strive for cooperative agreements that avoid unproductive litigation, especially on interstate streams."
We will defend Wyoming’s water entitlements and assure the protection of our historical rights.
We will place Wyoming at the head of the class in water management within the Rocky Mountain region and the nation.
Our state lands are drawing more attention than ever before.
"Interest in recreation, agriculture and mineral production, hunting, habitat improvement and other uses of state lands continues to increase."
Tensions develop over who should regulate or operate the lands.
"I support legislation that will allow us to selectively sell lands in order to buy other parcels that afford better management, access and public benefit."
The Conservation Easement granted to the Jackson Hole Land Trust by the Land Board was an example of innovative cooperation.
It preserves state ownership and management of 19 sensitive acres in the Snake River Valley while immediately providing 97% of the appraised value for the easement.
"Engaged originally as a pilot program in 1997, these types of transactions are clear win/win situations for the state and our citizens."
Wyoming and all our western states need a new approach to natural resource management and environmental regulation.
"As Chairman of the Western Governors’ Association, I am encouraged that we are working toward real solutions through a new collection of principles that calls for greater participation and collaboration in decision making."
"This process will reward outcomes, rather than processes, and recognize the need for a variety of tools beyond regulation to improve environmental management."
We recognize that markets and incentives can yield more positive and permanent results than pre scriptive methods and punitive measures.
"I will work with you, the Legislature, to implement these fundamental principles in our state."
We realize that we face tough choices regarding open spaces and land use.
We need sustainable natural resource management as well as sustainable economic growth for our communities.
Decisions on land use should be made at the local level.
Decisions that affect private lands must support private property rights.
Incentives should be considered to preserve open spaces.
"But whether public or private land, we must have a long range view."
No one has exclusive jurisdiction for resource management in a given state.
Land ownership patterns don’t follow land use patterns.
We have concurrent responsibilities with the federal government and shared obligations for accountability.
"We have worked hard to increase the level of cooperation between and among federal, state and local managers."
"And, we’ve made sure that cooperation doesn’t mean capitulation."
I strongly support the Western States Presidential Preference Primary that has the support of at least eight western states and the Council of State Governments.
Your support is needed as well.
"Federal Issues Public lands issues dominate discussions at the federal level, we will defend our rights to set requirements for other services as well."
"Education, health care, and administration of justice are the proper domain of the states."
We will be involved in an y efforts to define a national policy.
"No strings need be attached, nor sanctions imposed on our capability to deliver services."
"Other important issues for Wyoming include essential air service, electric power restructuring or regulation, taxing commerce on the Internet, nuclear waste storage and disposal."
"While you will not be voting on the outcome, your messages and participation at the federal level is vital."
"We, in Wyoming, have a close working relationship with our Congressional delegation, and I publicly thank Senator Craig Thomas, Senator Mike Enzi, and Representative Barbara Cubin."
Reauthorization of the existing Endangered Species Act leads the list of actions that need Congressional attention.
"We need better funding, greater certainty for landowners, and a better process for de-listing recovered species."
We have the potential for over 70 listings of species as threatened or endangered in our state.
We have managed our habitat well or they wouldn’t be here.
"Yet, the federal government wants to tell us how to do it and then makes us pay for it.There must be a change."
Quality Living We are approaching the final year of this century and this millennium.
"The year 2000 will come in 352 days, 14 hours and about 30 minutes from now."
The rate of change across society will only increase as we move into the next one thousand years.
We mu st work together to keep that change positive.
"As leaders, we must be guided by civility, not by confrontation."
We must return to common courtesy and politeness in our personal and institutional relationships.
We must inspire public service and respect for public office.
"We must not allow feelings to prevail over facts and we must not tolerate injustice to avoid discomfort, nor allow perception to displace truth."
"Our citizens know better, expect more from their leaders, and will hold us accountable."
I offer to you my assistance and my friendship as you work during the 1999 Legislative Session.
We have the potential for a highly productive session.
We can provide the opportunities the people want and then let them lead the charge.That is the Wyoming way.
That is the way America should be.
I wish you a productive and rewarding session.Thank you!
