Citizens, colleagues, guests and friends.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of the Legislature, members of the Supreme Court, constitutional officers, cabinet members, Lieutenant Governor Farrow, First Lady Laurie McCallum, and family.
In keeping with time-honored tradition, I come before you tonight to report on the state of the state.
I am pleased to report that the state of our state reflects the will of our people… and like the state of our state….
Our will is strong.
Our fellow citizens are looking to the future with courage, confidence and hope….
And I am optimistic that what we do in the coming year will move Wisconsin toward an even brighter tomorrow.
There is energy and optimism throughout the land, and as elected representatives of the people, we must recognize that our citizens feel the winds of change.
The people I have talked to the past year across Wisconsin do not fear change or reform.
In fact, they expect it and accept it.
From welfare reform to extended unemployment benefits to SeniorCare, Wisconsin has embraced a tradition of change.
Tonight, I also want to talk with you about what we can do together – not as Republicans and Democrats, or state and locals, or rural and urban-dwellers, but as Wisconsinites – to build a better future for our children and ourselves.
As we gather in this historic chamber, it is time to put differences behind and embrace a new spirit of partnership between state and local government and between local governments.
The past six weeks have been tumultuous.
There are not easy answers or quick fixes as we put our fiscal house in order.
But I believe now is the time to forge a new relationship between all units of Wisconsin government… a relationship based on mutual respect… on collaboration….
And on the principle that by working toward a common goal, we can renew our state’s spirit and health.
So, tonight I extend my hand in the spirit of friendship and cooperation to begin this important journey.
Working together toward a common purpose, we can achieve the oldest hopes of our ancestors -- caring and safe communities, loving families and prosperity for all.
I am optimistic about the future because during the past year, I witnessed over and over the true Wisconsin spirit… a spirit driven by goodness and compassion.
Let us now pause to reflect on a moment in time that will remain etched in our collective memories.
On a Tuesday morning last September, we awoke to a beautiful, crisp Wisconsin day.
Our thoughts were on the Packers' recent win over Detroit… on the upcoming day….
And we awoke to the sounds of our children scrambling down the stairs, still excited about the start of a new school year.
Our peace and tranquility were shattered when we saw on television the images of horror and anguish.
The sounds… the pictures of destruction… the terror and the suffering that were immediately and forever seared into our memory.
Since that day, we have lived in an age tarnished by the evil of a few… and yet invigorated by the goodness of so many.
Within hours of the attack, we saw the true spirit of America and the true Wisconsin spirit.
We saw members of the Wisconsin National Guard, specially trained to respond to any threat, join ranks with state and local law enforcement officers to quickly begin keeping us safe.
We saw firefighters from Wisconsin travel to Ground Zero in New York City to lend a helping hand in the rescue and recovery efforts among the crumpled steel of the twin towers.
We saw people in every walk of life, in every city and every town in Wisconsin, attend prayer services, pitch in with bake sales and roll up their sleeves to donate blood.
We saw local government doing its part in the war against terrorism by taking immediate action as our “first responders.
To all who displayed the strong leadership and steady hand to keep Wisconsin safe during that time, I speak on behalf of all Wisconsin in extending to each of you a heart-felt “thank you!” Tonight, on the 165th anniversary of the Wisconsin National Guard, 833 members of the Wisconsin Army and Air National Guard are on active duty in Wisconsin, in the continental United States and around the world.
They are part of our response to September 11th and the Department of Military Affairs’ continuing, long-term involvement across three fronts — protecting Wisconsin’s security, homeland defense, and fighting international terrorism.
I would like you to meet some of the fine men and women representing Wisconsin in our war against terrorism.
They show the diversity of activities in our common defense.
They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters.
Please hold your applause until after I’ve introduced them: Lt. Col. Tim O’Brien is an F-16 pilot and is the fighter squadron commander of the 115th Fighter Wing of Madison.
Tech.
Sgt.
Tony White is a KC-135 boom operator with the 128th Air Refueling Wing of Milwaukee who has flown missions both overseas and here in the United States since Sept. 11.
Master Sgt.
Tina Christenson is a radio communications specialist with the 128th Air Control Squadron from Volk Field who helped protect the skies over Chicago for more than three months.
Sgt.
First Class Joseph Chapa has been on duty at Milwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport as a member of Task Force Noble Badger.
He represents the units assigned to airport security.
And Chief Warrant Officer Dave Molitor is the 829th Engineer Detachment commander.
Twelve soldiers from this detachment, located in Richland Center, were ordered to active duty in November and deployed to “an undisclosed location” in central Asia.
They are now located in Kandahar.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in showing our appreciation for these brave men and women.
All of America and all of Wisconsin have been tested and challenged over the past 13 months in many ways.
Seventeen counties in western Wisconsin were tested by floodwaters of the mighty Mississippi a year ago… and destructive tornadoes tested our resolve in western and northern Wisconsin.
We were tested by terrorism and a faltering national economy that took its toll on Wisconsin and 44 other states, causing budget shortfalls and forcing a serious re-examination of our spending habits at every level of government.
But with each test, and at every turn, we witnessed the Wisconsin character at work.
We saw Wisconsinites react to adversity with optimism and determination to overcome every challenge so that Wisconsin can be a better place to live and raise a family.
There are countless examples of where the Wisconsin character prevailed the past year, including many where the stage extended beyond our borders.
Just a few weeks ago, the entire world watched in wonder as our very own homegrown Casey FitzRandolph of Verona and Chris Witty of West Allis competed in the Salt Lake City Olympic games.
Of course, we all know that Casey and Chris were golden.
Both Casey and Chris are competing in Europe and can’t join us tonight, but that won’t stop us from celebrating their success of what it took to win gold.
Jeff and Ruthie FitzRandolph have spent thousands of hours molding their son’s character and work ethic.
As a parent and coach myself of three very athletic and active children, I know the difficulties of balancing work with the demands of instilling in your child a competitive spirit that they will carry with them in life.
There are many sacrifices that Jeff and Ruthie have made to help Casey along his path to Olympic glory, and tonight we pay homage to their dedication and their commitment.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize tonight Jeff and Ruthie FitzRandolph.
There is another individual with us in the chamber who knows a thing or two about adversity.
This was supposed to be a “rebuilding” year for Badger basketball – we had a new coach with a new system, a group of young players and one of the toughest schedules in the country.
But with each game, the Wisconsin character emerged.
We watched the new coach and the determined players react to adversity with confidence and conviction to overcome every challenge thrown their way.
The result is Wisconsin’s first big ten title since 1947!
The Badgers also became the first UW team since 1941 to beat every conference team in the same season.
The coach, Bo Ryan, is the winningest first-year coach in Wisconsin history with 18 wins and only the seventh coach in Big Ten history to win the conference championship in his first year.
And just today, Bo was named Big Ten coach of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, Bo Ryan.
I also want to recognize Marquette basketball coach Tom Crean for the great job he has done this year… coach Crean is in Cincinnati tonight and couldn’t join us, but he deserves our thanks for a job well done.
We accomplished much under this dome last year, primarily by putting political differences aside and working together for the common good.
Let me take a moment to highlight a few of these accomplishments: I was pleased to have been able to bring together key legislators, the business community, sportsmen, sportswomen and environmental groups to craft a consensus and pass a law to protect our wetlands and our environment.
It is the first of its kind in the nation.
Two individuals who played key roles were Republican Representative Neal Kedzie of Elkhorn and Democrat Senator Jim Baumgart of Sheboygan.
Working in a spirit of bipartisanship with A.
A. R. P. the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups and countless Democrats and Republicans, we passed a prescription drug benefit program for nearly 300,000 Wisconsin seniors that will serve as a national model in senior health care.
Last year, I introduced a fiscally sound, balanced and realistic budget for the state, which kept spending increases to the lowest level in more than 30 years, held the line on taxes, and protected our core priorities of education and helping the state’s neediest citizens.
These principles paved the way for a bipartisan budget agreement in August.
I want to acknowledge Republican Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen of Waukesha and Democrat Majority Leader Chuck Chvala of Madison.
I also want to acknowledge the co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee – Republican Representative John Gard of Peshtigo and Democrat Senator Brian Burke of Milwaukee – and thank them for getting the budget passed in the shortest time in more than six years.
And earlier this year, Wisconsin became the first state in the country to provide extended benefits to unemployed and displaced workers.
There were other accomplishments, as well.
We have taken huge strides in our relationship with the state's tribal governments.
I would like to acknowledge the tribal chairmen with us tonight.
We have continued to move people from welfare to work.
Just last week I joined President Bush and Secretary Tommy Thompson in announcing a welfare reform agenda that will help more welfare recipients achieve independence through work, protect children and strengthen families.
We invested in smaller class sizes ….
Because smaller class sizes have proven to be an effective learning environment for children.
Thanks to the efforts of this Legislature, SAGE will allow more than 500 schools to reduce class sizes in grades K through 3.
We have provided our youngest children with every opportunity to reach their full potential by investing in 4-year-old kindergarten.
We are taking the necessary action to make Milwaukee the jewel of Wisconsin, and are taking steps to make southeast Wisconsin a world-class economic powerhouse.
When we build Milwaukee and southeast Wisconsin, we build all of Wisconsin.
That’s why we must improve the Menomonee Valley, through the redevelopment of Canal Street.
We will be helping revitalize downtown Milwaukee.
The Marquette Interchange is the heart of Wisconsin’s transportation system, and we have finalized plans for the largest capital project in our state’s history.
State Fair Park is becoming self-sufficient and a year-round attraction, thanks to the steps I’ve taken.
UW-Milwaukee is becoming a first-class institution nationally, with the help of our budget.
And the consortium of five universities through the new TechStar program will combine academics and business to create economic growth.
Working together in a bipartisan fashion, legislative members of the Building Commission were influential in getting the first Biostar project approved, a project that keeps UW-Madison at the forefront of biotechnology.
I applaud Senators Risser, Meyer and Roessler, and Representatives Hoven, Vrakas and Plale.
Wisconsin taxpayers saved $62.9 million through the aggressive use of my veto pen – the highest veto amount ever for a biennial budget signed into law.
I unveiled a comprehensive energy package that serves the economic interests of the state and preserves our resources and environment.
In the aftermath of 9-11, statewide price gouging at gas stations was stopped after I personally directed investigators to identify known offenders immediately.
A few weeks after the cowardly attacks on America, I established an anti-terrorism task force to address current and future terrorism issues in Wisconsin.
And all of us did our part throughout the year to ensure that the Packers returned to the NFL playoffs after a short – but painful – absence.
And while they didn’t go all the way, it sure was a fun ride….
And the Pack will be back!
That is a list of accomplishments of which we can all be proud ….
And the best is yet to come.
In my inaugural address last year I introduced the principles that would guide me as your governor – holding the line on government spending, no tax increases, improving education, building wisconsin through economic development and job creation, and assisting our seniors and the neediest of the needy.
The executive budget I sent to you last year also reflected these principles, and they are the foundation of my budget reform act, which I unveiled Jan. 22.
I believe so strongly that these principles reflect the core values of all Wisconsinites that I state them again.
One, we must always put the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin – the taxpayers – first.
Two, we have a responsibility to provide the best education for our children.
That’s why I exempted schools from cuts in my Budget Reform Act.
My goal is to make Wisconsin schools the best in the world.
We will get there because of the best teachers in the world.
Teachers like Tenia Jenkins, whose dedication and professionalism exemplify our teachers and staff throughout Wisconsin’s schools.
Tenia has been a teacher for 30 years, the last 20 at the Malcolm Shabazz Alternative High School in Madison.
Tenia embodies the Wisconsin spirit… she is a true pioneer.
She taught the first African-American history and women’s classes in Madison’s traditional high schools and continues to be a well-known advocate for young people and a mentor to parents.
Ladies and gentlemen, Tenia Jenkins.
Three, we will create high-paying jobs that reward high-skilled labor, the kind of labor that has become the hallmark of the Wisconsin work ethic.
And four, we have an absolute responsibility to care for people who can't care for themselves.
That’s why I protected the SeniorCare prescription drug program and the Medical Assistance programs in the Budget Reform Act.
Tonight, I want to put a face on why I made this decision relating to Medical Assistance.
Dr. Kevin Izard is a family practitioner from Milwaukee.
He is a Wisconsin Medical Society member from the Capitol Drive Health Care Center, where 90 percent of his practice is with Medicaid patients.
Dr. Izard, you have dedicated your life to serving the urban poor… and for that, Wisconsin thanks you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Kevin Izard.
Today, we are in the midst of a challenging special session.
Government must do what all Wisconsin families do when they gather around the kitchen table and look at their budgets – live within its means.
I said it wouldn’t be easy, but that it is time to make tough decisions and limit government spending while protecting services for those who need us the most – our children, the elderly and the disabled.
You might recall that, in my budget reform act speech, I predicted this would be a controversial package because it holds the line on taxes and dramatically reins in government spending at every level.
Tonight, I repeat my pledge to the hard-working men and women of this state: I will continue to oppose any budget solution that includes higher taxes….
And I will continue to push for greater efficiency in government.
My plan calls for bold reform of the state and local partnership.
Those who argue that the shared revenue program should be preserved in its current form ignore the fact that much has changed in state and local finances in the last 30 years.
From a state budget perspective, there is little doubt the state and local partnership needs to be reformed because the current system is not sustainable.
It is time Wisconsin has this much-needed discussion.
In town halls and city councils across the state, and right here in the Capitol, already the debate has changed from how we spend money to how we can save money.
In fact, during the past six weeks I’ve seen a number of leaders step to the plate and initiate discussions on making government more efficient.
Some leaders have had great success in this area in the past, and their efforts to save money through consolidation and the merger of services with neighboring governments is gaining new momentum.
These architects of change include Ripon Mayor Robert Somers, who says every elected official –regardless of constituency – must listen to taxpayers and continue to cut spending.
And Wausau’s Linda Lawrence, who was pushing a merger plan before the Budget Reform Act was unveiled and now wants to accelerate her plan to save Wausau taxpayers money.
And Appleton’s Tim Hanna…who continues to push city staff and city leaders to pursue a regional strategy.
A strategy based on coordination of services that promote stronger community partnerships and provide greater value for citizens.
Another architect of change who has understood for years the need to consolidate services is Waukesha County Executive Dan Finley.
Dan has called for a new countywide department of public safety to manage their dispatching system.
In Madison, Mayor Sue Bauman has proposed budget cuts and is working diligently with Dane County officials to strengthen efforts to consolidate city and county functions.
South Milwaukee’s David Kieck is exploring consolidation with Cudahy and St. Francis leaders for police dispatch and emergency crews.
Neenah’s Ken Harwood has taken steps toward merging their fire department with that of nearby Menasha.
There have been discussions about saving taxpayers money in Marathon County, too….
Officials there want to consolidate county parks and forestry departments.
Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago counties are talking about consolidating landfill and recycling programs, and Price County officials adopted a hiring freeze and froze spending on capital equipment.
Former Milwaukee County Executive David Schulz said there is a new spirit of public engagement for reforming and ultimately reinventing local government in Milwaukee and Wisconsin.
I quote: “For more than two centuries, our tradition in the United States has been one of constantly reinventing our society and government.
If Milwaukee and Wisconsin can do so now, then the future will be bright with promise and opportunity.
End quote.
And Racine County Executive Jean Jacobson, a Kettl Commission member who has had success with consolidations and mergers, recently was asked by other municipalities to provide insight on how to get people to cooperate.
Quote: “Put them in a room together, give them a little coffee and something to eat.
We have to put our politics at the door.
It’s just good, plain common sense.
After the governor’s message, we’re all going to be crying together….
We might as well work on solutions together.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate has changed!
And we must continue to move the focus from protecting government institutions to protecting the working people of Wisconsin.
The debate has changed.
To all local officials, I say this tonight: Let’s work together … because we share a common goal – shaping a better tomorrow for the hard-working families of this state and giving taxpayers the best return on their dollar.
I am committed to working with town boards, county executives, village presidents and mayors across Wisconsin to develop long-term solutions for efficiency, cooperation, consolidation and accountability at every level of government – both state and local.
The budget reform act contains language to create a task force to address this very issue.
But because the debate has so clearly moved from spend to save, we must move forward with the task force immediately.
Reform itself must begin now.
I will create, by executive order, the Governor’s Task Force on State and Local Government, to be headed by Milwaukee’s Tim Sheehy.
The goal of the task force will be to build a better Wisconsin through state and local partnerships.
The task force will consist of those who are willing to roll up their sleeves and work together for the greater good of Wisconsin’s taxpayers.
My first appointments will be those representing local government.
The first charge of the task force is to conduct a thorough review of state mandates.
We must eliminate all mandates that are barriers to consolidation and merging local government functions.
We must make it easier for local governments to consolidate and become more efficient.
We must identify financial incentives for local government to consolidate services where possible.
We need to reward economic development and growth.
Every study has shown, and few people disagree, that we have too much government in Wisconsin.
We now need to approach the problem in a reasonable fashion.
As we ponder important fiscal issues, there are other matters that will command our attention this year.
In the coming months we will accelerate our efforts within Wisconsin on issues concerning terrorism and security.
Wisconsin stands to receive as much as $20 million in federal aid this year for domestic security.
I recently met with Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge.
He delivered a clear message: As we move forward to protect our families through new law enforcement measures, our statewide efforts must focus on regional needs within our borders.
Local officials will play a crucial role as “first responders,” and we must recognize that what works in Milwaukee or Port Washington may not work in La Crosse… and vice versa.
Cooperation, regionalization and accountability – these are themes that will dominate the landscape this year.
In the coming months, I will focus on economic development and education, two separate policy areas that are driven at the local level….
And two policy areas that, for the first time ever in Wisconsin, are now linked as one.
For too long, the debate over financing education has pitted educators against the business community.
Last year, I moved to bridge that gap by bringing many of the state’s key players from both sides together for discussions.
I knew such a meeting was risky, but I moved forward because I believe that when the children of Wisconsin receive the education they deserve, other goals – a strong economy, lower crime rates, healthier families, and fewer demands on government – are within easy reach.
Today, with educators and business breaking the old “politics as usual” mold, the dynamics have dramatically changed in this state.
The partnership of business and education is moving forward with unshakable determination.
I applaud all the individuals involved in this discussion for their willingness and their courage in the face of criticism to work together to bring Wisconsin schools and Main Street closer together.
I remain optimistic that this new dynamic and the fruits of our labor will pay benefits now and for many years to come.
We live in a globally competitive environment; the pace of change is rapidly increasing and the stakes are growing higher.
Many of our neighboring states have recognized this and are positioning themselves.
We must move quickly, too.
Later this spring, I will unveil a statewide business plan as part of my Build Wisconsin program.
The plan’s foundation will be based on the economic development model of “clusters.
A cluster is a related technology or industry where the elements necessary for prosperity – the ideas, research, capital, workforce and government support – exist in one place.
Instead of focusing on individual companies, clusters focus on regional economies and on related firms and supporting infrastructure.
Some of the clusters Build Wisconsin will pursue include agriculture, biotechnology, finance, insurance, information technology and data processing, manufacturing, papermaking and forest products, medical devices, automotive and tourism.
The good news is that Wisconsin’s per capita income in the 1990's grew slightly faster than the per capita income of the Midwest and the nation.
And the cost of living is significantly lower in Milwaukee than in our main border-state competitors, Minneapolis and Chicago.
But on the other end of the spectrum, in the year 2000, Illinois and Minnesota workers earned more each year than the hard-working men and women in Wisconsin.
That is unacceptable.
We must do better.
We must set our goals high.
My vision for Wisconsin’s future is expansive, but not expensive: we can make government at all levels work better and smarter.
We will continue holding the line on spending and taxes so that Wisconsin moves out of the top five highest-tax states by 2003 and out of the top 10 by 2006.
With a statewide business plan as our roadmap, our goal will be to raise Wisconsin’s per capita income above the national average by the end of 2005 and surpass Illinois and Minnesota in wages earned by the end of the decade!
In times of challenge, we must keep sight of our goals.
In the coming years, we will build on our past successes to enhance our economic vitality and preserve our quality of life.
As I reflect on our state of the state, I am bolstered by the belief that the goodness and strength of our people will prevail.
The future is ours to make.
While some states may fret and worry about the future, the Wisconsin spirit will serve as our beacon for a prosperous and healthy Wisconsin.
Recently, I was asked what Wisconsin might look like in 10 years.
I see a future with a vibrant business climate that will continue to create good-paying jobs.
I see a thriving economy with nationally renowned companies opening their doors….
And a highly skilled workforce.
I see schools where children are challenged.
Teachers are given the respect they deserve.
And accountability is the common denominator for our entire school system.
I see children and families with health care and childcare.
I see top-notch academic programs producing first-rate students and leaders.
I see a national biotechnology center in Wisconsin.
I see basketball championship banners hanging from the rafters of the Kohl Center and the Bradley Center.
I see the Lombardi Trophy back at its rightful home – Lambeau Field… the same year the Badgers win the national championship on the gridiron.
I see families exploring open space, swimming at our pristine beaches, fishing in our lakes and riding on our bike paths.
I see a world-class transportation system that quickly and smoothly moves people and goods around and into Wisconsin….
And moves products out.
I see farmland where young children learn to carry on the historic legacy of the family farm from their parents and grandparents.
I see visitors and residents celebrating Wisconsin’s ethnic and cultural diversity from Superior to Kenosha … from Marinette to Monroe.
I see great days ahead for men and women of will and vision.
But most of all, I see a Wisconsin in the shining light of a rising sun… fresh from the burning, creative hand of God.
Thank you very much.
God bless you, and God bless Wisconsin.
