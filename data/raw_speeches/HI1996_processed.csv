SENTENCES
"President Mizuguchi, Speaker Souki, Members of the 18th Hawaii State Legislature, Lt. Governor Hirono, Chief Justice Moon, Mayors Harris and Yamashiro, Members of the Consular Corps and our military, Honored Guests, my Fellow Citizens: Before I begin my second State of the State Address, I want to thank my family, friends and my hardworking cabinet for the support they have given to me over the past year."
They were there when I needed them most and I will never forget it.
"In my first State of the State Address, I focused almost entirely on the State's budget crisis."
"This morning, I ask for your indulgence."
THE FIRST YEAR My administration took office in the midst of the longest economic slump in Hawaii's history.
We face the worst fiscal crisis in our State's history.
"After only 45 days in office, we were forced to take action and we did.First, we cut spending."
I gave education the highest priority.
"The Department of Education (DOE) was cut only 3.1%, University of Hawaii (UH)-8.9%--while most other departments experienced cuts ranging from 10 to 22%."
"Second, fourteen programs were eliminated and many others were downsized."
"Third, we eliminated nearly 1,200 jobs, including laying off 600 warm bodies.It was not easy.It was painful."
But it had to be done and we did it.
"Today there are 2,750 fewer employees in the Executive Branch of State government than there were one year ago."
State spending has fallen for the first time in years.
Today the State spends less than it did in 1993.
"In our efforts to reduce spending, we became more cost efficient and effective."
For example: The Department of Accounting and General Services has cut the average building time for a classroom by one third.
"The Department of Health, with Transportation and Land and Natural Resources, developed a team approach to permit approvals."
In four months they cleared up a $400 million backlog in federal Clean Water permits for construction.
One of these projects was the $78 million Ford Island Causeway.
"Two weeks ago, ground was broken."
Changes in management practices have cut sick leave and overtime abuse at our prisons saving $1 million in overtime costs.
The Tax Department has streamlined the filing process with a one-page individual income tax form.
Tax information is now on the Internet.
Electronic filing of state tax returns is now being developed.
Using technology our public libraries have increased by more than seven times the newspapers and magazines local readers can access.
"The Kailua Library, for example, used the innovative self-directed work team approach to increase its reader output from l,000 to 2,000 books per day."
"Today, library hours have been restored to what they were before the fiscal crisis."
"We have just implemented a pilot program to put all State bid notices, requests for proposals, and other legal notices on the Internet."
When fully implemented it will save the taxpayers millions in newspaper advertising costs.
"THE CURRENT BUDGET In our current efforts to deal with the budget crisis, we are making progress towards restructuring."
"We propose to consolidate or eliminate State boards, commissions and other bodies which we believe are unnecessary or outmoded."
"We propose to abolish the Hawaii Labor Relations Board, the Board of Human Services, the Fisheries Coordinating Council and other outmoded bodies."
"We propose to abolish the Office of State Planning and the Office of Children and Youth, moving their necessary functions to appropriate departments."
We propose to phase out the Land Court.
We propose a single Office of Housing.
"This will consolidate the Hawaii Housing Authority, the Housing Finance Development Corporation, and the Rental Housing Trust Fund."
We propose that the Hawaii Labor and Industrial Relation Appeals Board be restructured.
We propose to reform our Civil Service System.
No other event demonstrated the need for civil service reform more than the recent layoffs of 600 state employees last year.
The specter of mostly young and excellent state workers being bumped solely on the basis of seniority could be defended 30 years ago when the individual worker had few legal rights to defend him or herself from ruthless employers.
"Then, seniority was a useful and much needed right."
It makes little sense for us to let this practice continue.
"If we want to make government better, we must reform the civil system to include merit along with seniority as a factor in determining an employee's rights."
"In this connection, I am pleased to know that the Hawaii State Teachers Association and the University of Hawaii Professional Assembly publicly expressed their support of a merit-based civil service system."
We are ready and willing to work with the unions and the Legislature in considering this reform.
I cannot tell you today that our fiscal crisis is over.
But we are in a better position than one year ago.
Working together we will be better next year.
We have submitted our financial plan.
It has been carefully constructed.
If you disagree with our recommendations--we are open to your ideas.
"But in order to avoid massive layoffs you must replace spending cuts or revenue increases, dollar for dollar."
"For example, our proposal to save $47 million through a one-time payroll lag has been criticized."
"That $47 million represents approximately 1,300 State jobs."
"We will join both the House and Senate in your effort to establish a ""rainy day"" fund."
We have a constitutional duty to balance the budget.
"Working together, we will do it."
"RESTORING ECONOMIC MOMENTUM Our ability to fulfill our dreams and meet our responsibilities -- for social services, to protect the environment, to offer each child a quality education -- are all tied to the strength of our economy."
That is why restoring economic momentum is my top priority.
"I will be releasing a comprehensive plan entitled, ""Restoring Hawaii's Economic Momentum,"" which expands upon issues I will touch upon today.I urge you to read it."
State government cannot spend itself into early recovery.
Our hope for economic recovery must come from the private sector.
"It is the private sector which must be the primary stimulus to the economy, providing jobs and income to our people.There are some good signs."
"Presently, tourism is rebounding."
Japanese visitors are returning in greater numbers.
And the economic recovery on the mainland should give us yet another boost.
But much more has to be done to help revitalize our economy.
Our challenge is to adjust government policies to allow the private sector to recapture its momentum.
The first major change is one of attitude toward business.
The State government must be a facilitator for the economy and not just a regulator.
"This requires a major change in the historical ""us against them"" attitude."
"Government, businesses, and labor must develop a new attitude of partnership and cooperation.We have begun the process.Construction."
"To help the construction industry, we have increased our efficiency in processing permits."
In some areas we have reduced delays for public building projects by one third.
These reforms have allowed me to release nearly $600 million in state capital improvements for schools and other infrastructure by the end of this fiscal year.
It will also reduce project costs in the private sector and provide more jobs.Housing.
We will redefine our housing policy to get the state out of the business of competing with the private sector.
The State's main housing responsibility must be to increase rental housing and shelter for the disadvantaged whose housing needs are not being met by the private sector.
"In addition to restructuring our housing policy, we will provide incentives to private developers to build rental housing in joint developments with counties, mutual housing associations and non-profit organizations."
And we will end the State's so-called 60-40 affordable housing rule and leave it to the counties to negotiate such details with each developer.Workers Compensation.
We will press our efforts to bring down the cost of workers compensation.
"We propose setting up a non-profit domestic mutual insurance company, owned and run by the businesses now in the assigned risk pool."
This concept has been successfully used in other states to lower the cost of workers compensation.
We believe it can work in Hawaii.Automobile Insurance.
Changes in our workers compensation medical fee schedule are already reducing automobile insurance premiums.
"Indeed, one major automobile insurance company recently announced it would reduce premiums by 25%."
We will propose automobile insurance reform that preserves the right of injured persons to seek just redress while reducing premiums by 35 to 40 percent.Telecommunications.
"When I took office one year ago, Hawaii had one wired-based telecommunications company."
We strongly urged you to deregulate telecommunications.You passed the bill.
"Today, Hawaii has three wire-based and three new wireless companies."
"As a result, our local banks have financed approximately $1 billion for telecommunications development."
"Next year, we expect to have a choice of telephone carriers and potentially 30% in lower consumer costs."
"Within three years, we expect to have complete statewide telecommunications service with satellite and fiber optic links across the Pacific to Asia."
This will give Hawaii the capability of being part of the global economy and a major player in the Asia-Pacific region.
All of this was accomplished without spending one State dollar.
We did it by simply changing our State law to free up competition.Export Of Goods And Service.
"Last month, two dozen small Hawaii companies were able to sell nearly $1 million worth of made-in-Hawaii products in just two hours through the cable telemarketer QVC."
This was the most successful sale of products ever.
This experience tells us there is a high demand for made-in-Hawaii products on the mainland United States.
We will help market these products.
But even more promising for Hawaii products and services is the huge and rapidly growing Asia-Pacific market.
"We talk about this market a lot, but few truly understand its magnitude and potential."
"Let's talk about China, the biggest nation in Asia with 1.2 billion people."
Guandong Province alone has 71 million people -- more than France or Italy or England.
"And yet, most of us know more about France, Italy and England than we do about Guandong Province."
China is a huge market but it is a part of the Asia-Pacific market.
Motorola expects 1/2 to 2/3 of its future business will be from this market alone.
"Indeed, it has been estimated that China needs to spend $800 billion over the next decade to build an infrastructure to support a developed economy."
We need to find our niches in the Asia-Pacific market for our made-in-Hawaii products and our professional services.And we are already there.
"GTE-Hawaiian Tel, Hawaiian Electric, Bank of Hawaii are already doing business in the Philippines."
Other Hawaiian firms are being solicited to help develop infrastructure in several provinces in China.
"To encourage them to go after this business in the Asia-Pacific market, we are introducing legislation to eliminate the General Excise Tax for certain exporters of professional services such as architectural, engineering and construction firms."
We need private sector creativity and investment if we are to increase our capacity for future growth.
The State simply does not have the resources or ability to do it alone.
We must create the appropriate business climate to make this happen.
We intend to enhance the Enterprise Zones program by modifying their restrictive rules to create high-value jobs in knowledge-based industries such as health care and technology.Tourism.
Tourism is the engine which drives our economy.
We must continue to assist the private sector to market Hawaii as a world-class destination resort.
"In this connection, the State's $350 million investment in the Convention Center will play a critical role in attracting more business and professional visitors."
It will fix Hawaii as a world-class business destination beyond the turn of the century.
"More importantly, it will provide a vast array of benefits, including more jobs, investment, and trade."
"As Governor, I will take every step to ensure that the Convention Center will open on time, as planned."
Honolulu's waterfront from Kewalo Basin to Keehi Lagoon has long been acknowledged as Oahu's premier untapped asset.
"Progress has been made on the waterfront, including the Aloha Tower Marketplace and Kakaako Waterfront Park."
I want to see the day when Hawaii's people and our visitors can walk from end to end along this Golden Coast.
"As they stroll along, they would pass green grass with tree-shaded benches, glistening beaches, and inviting shops and restaurants."
"At Honolulu Harbor, they could stop to watch a bustling commercial port."
"Adjoining the Kakaako Waterfront, they could visit a world class aquarium."
"At Keehi Lagoon they would see a water sports center with world championships in kayaking, sculling and canoeing."
Development of Honolulu's waterfront is an important part of our efforts to restore economic momentum.Health Care.
I believe Hawaii can be the health care center of the Pacific.
"As you know, we recently hosted representatives of the Mayo Clinic in an effort to get them to establish a presence in Hawaii."
We will continue our efforts to develop a health industry which services the people of Hawaii and the Pacific Rim.
"Private hospitals such as Straub, Queens and Kuakini have already launched similar initiatives."
"Straub, for example, has brought in the Joslin Diabetes Center of Boston."
We will support their efforts and launch our own initiatives.Science and Technology.
Another promising area of economic growth is science and technology.
We already have substantial assets: The leading center for astronomy in the Northern Hemisphere is Mauna Kea.
The most powerful super computer in the U. S. for imaging is on Maui.
"The Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai is the most advanced high-tech center in the world for surface, air, and underwater naval training."
The University of Hawaii houses one of the leading ocean research programs in the world.
"Next month, we will dedicate the Pacific Disaster Center in Kihei."
It will be the first link in a world network of disaster centers.
We must build on these assets to develop high-tech programs and businesses.
"To develop a strategy for the best use of our resources, I am forming a Governor's Task Force on Science & Technology to be chaired by Lt. Governor Mazie Hirono.Kapolei."
"I am committed to making the Second City of Kapolei a vibrant center to live, to work, to learn."
The development of Kapolei will improve the quality of life for all Oahu residents.
Housing in Kapolei will be affordable; people will be able to live close to where they work; and traffic congestion in Honolulu will be reduced.
The University of Hawaii at West Oahu is an integral part of the dream of Kapolei.
We recently completed a land exchange agreement with the Campbell Estate for a site in Kapolei.
"In exchange for 58 acres at Hawaii Raceway Park, the State will receive 950 acres for the new campus."
This exchange will make it possible for the State to build the West Oahu campus without draining funding from other UH campuses.
The campus will serve not only the people of Leeward-Central Oahu -- the fastest growing area in the State -- but our entire state and the Pacific Rim.
"With your approval of the land exchange, we will build this campus with no general fund appropriation."
"Clearly, in our push for economic development, we recognize the overriding importance of our Neighbor Islands."
Thus we have begun discussions with the Mayors of the counties to deal with important issues.
"We are taking steps to ease the pain of structural dislocations caused by the phase-out of sugar and pineapple, and to encourage the transition to new economic bases."
"We are encouraging investment in forestry, diversified agriculture and cultivation of energy-producing crops, perhaps the building of a minimum security prison on the Big Island."
(Let me digress from my text to say that we will expand our facilities at Waiawa from 37 to 200 beds for our drug treatment program.
Mayor Harris has graciously offered to help us build at Waiawa.I accept his offer.
Already several private firms have expressed interest in commercial forestry operations and a prison on the Big Island.
We will also work to promote the visitor industry on the Neighbor Islands by building airport facilities which will allow direct international flights.Environment.
"One part of our challenge is to protect our irreplaceable natural resources, endangered species, land and water."
"The other is to manage and improve renewable resources -- our forests, oceans, parks and beaches -- for long-term access, enjoyment and public benefit."
"I foresee a ""string of pearls"" State park system with at least one major wilderness park on each island -- Na Pali on Kauai, Kaena and Ka Iwi on Oahu, Makena on Maui, and the Kona Coast on the Big Island."
"Community groups, environmental organizations, hiking clubs, and even businesses could adopt these parks and help care for them in a public-private partnership.Welfare Reform."
We will submit a welfare reform package that insists on individual and family responsibility and that provides opportunities to build self-reliance and self-sufficiency.
"Last year, we instituted a work requirement for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program."
"As a result, the number of those employed has increased more than four times, and the number of those who have gotten off AFDC is twice what it was last year."
"Also, last year, we began a new Public-Private Employment Partnership that asks private sector employers to participate with the State in expanding job training programs."
We will build on this collaborative effort which provides employers with motivated workers who can exit the welfare rolls.Hawaiian Home Lands.
"Last year you enacted with our support, a $600 million settlement of the Hawaiian Home Lands claims."
For each of the next 20 years the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) will receive $30 million to develop their lands for the Hawaiian people.
"In order to speed up the process even further, we propose making available lands in Hawaii Finance and Development Corporation projects in Kapolei, Leialii, and Kealakehe in Kailua-Kona to the DHHL."
Those lands already have the infrastructure so that construction can begin almost immediately.
"Thus, not only will the native Hawaiians be benefited, so will all of the others who will benefit from the homes freed up by the native Hawaiians moving into the new DHHL homes.Education."
Education remains the highest priority of this Administration.
Our young people are our future.
And we shall do all we can to provide them with quality education.
"For that reason, I have spared the public schools from any budget cuts."
"In my version of the budget, I did not cut one cent from the $631 million school instructional budget."
"A few years ago, I chaired the Legislature's Task Force On Educational Governance."
The Task Force made many recommendations which the Legislature adopted when it passed the Education Omnibus Bill three sessions ago.
The thrust of the Task Force's recommendations and the Education Omnibus Bill was to give the Department of Education and the public schools greater autonomy.That has been done.
"Two years ago, the Legislature gave the DOE lump-sum budgeting."
"More public schools have established School Community Based Management Councils, involving parents and community members in individual school decision-making."
Now is the time to give our educators the opportunity to implement some of the reforms we established.
Let them teach without us--you and I--burdening them with new laws and new demands.
"Of course, we should hold them accountable."
But we should also help by providing them with the resources they need to do the job.
CONCLUSION Building a better future is not simply about economic survival.
It is also about fulfilling our most cherished dreams and aspirations for our children and ourselves while being compassionate to those who need our help.
"Not a day goes by that I do not ask myself, ""How can Hawaii fulfill its destiny and reach its full potential?""Hawaii is a wonderful place."
We have so much to offer others.
"Not just scenery and climate, but a rich diversity of peoples and cultures.The Aloha Spirit."
"Unique skills, knowledge and experience that come from our unusual location and history."
"Most people now understand that we live in a fast-changing, global economy."
We can not let Hawaii get lost in the shuffle.
"In order for Hawaii to take its rightful place, Hawaii's economy must be strong."
That means we must diversify and grow.
"In the forceful words of Robert Reich, the value of a nation can be measured in the skill of its workforce."
My personal interpretation of this is that our people must be made relevant to our economy during this period of highly-charged change.How will we do this?
"In four distinct, yet inter-linked, ways."
"First, we must create the proper technological infrastructure to eliminate the disadvantages of distance we face."
"Second, we must help our young people acquire the skills, knowledge and attitudes that enable them to compete on a global basis."
"Third, we must create a positive business climate."
"Not just lip service to that idea, but an environment in which our government -- let me say it again -- is a facilitator not an obstacle to healthy business growth."
"Fourth, and most importantly, we need to believe in ourselves again."
Believe that we can go out into the world and accomplish anything we set out to do.
"Believe that -- given the proper tools, including education -- our kids can go anywhere they want, compete with anyone -- and win."
Believe that we can achieve all we dream of right here in Hawaii.
I believe this economic downturn will end.
But the Hawaii that emerges when it has passed will not be the one we remember from the 1970s or 1980s.
"Here in Hawaii, good fortune will not simply fall on us as it has in the past."
"We are going to have to face the problems that confront us, make tough decisions that may be unpopular with some people and push forward aggressively for what we believe is right."
We will all be judged by what we accomplish together in the next few months and years.
I do believe that times are getting better.
I am confident the economy will improve.
"Certainly, I am doing everything in my power to make it so."
"I truly believe that if we all work together, and do what is right, we can turn this crisis in a great opportunity to build a better Hawaii.Mahalo and Aloha."
