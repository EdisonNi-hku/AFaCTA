Mr. Speaker, Governor Siegelman, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Senate and the High Courts, my fellow Alabamians, on behalf of the executive branch of government, once again it is my privilege and duty to report to you on the State of the State.
We lost a dedicated public servant and a true friend when Representative Thomas Reed of Tuskegee died this past October.
We will miss him and our prayers are with Sereetta and her family.
I want to thank each member of the House and Senate who in the last three years helped pass proposals I submitted to you on education reform, court reform and welfare reform.
Thank you, also for the passage of a competitive industrial incentive law, a strong absentee ballot law, and a law banning partial birth abortions.
I am especially appreciative for the outstanding leadership of Speaker Jimmy Clark without whom our legislative initiatives would not have been successful.
Mr. Speaker, I know these are exciting days for you and I wish to recognize your 38 years of public service to the people of Alabama by presenting you this plaque.

We required that a student, in order to graduate from high school, must take English, social studies, math and science in all four years instead of just taking English and social studies.
Every student will now leave high school better grounded in core academic subjects and with a high school diploma that has real value.
In 1995, we were not funding K-12 nearly as well as we should or could.
But after three years funding has increased by over one-half billion dollars, with every cent of growth in the Education Trust Fund going to K-12.
State funding alone is annually about $700 dollars more per student or $14,000 more dollars for a classroom of 20 students or $210,000 dollars more for a school of 300 students.
Three years ago the average class size for one teacher was 30 to 35 students.
To date, we have hired over 2,000 new teachers, which allows the State Board of Education to reduce class sizes.
The limit of students in kindergarten through third grade is 18; in fourth through sixth grade, 26; in seventh through twelfth grade, 29.
The State Board will fully implement these reductions by August 1998, and each teacher will be able to spend more individual time with students who need special assistance.
Good discipline enhances learning within the classroom.
Teachers have told me they were afraid to impose discipline because of lawsuits.
Therefore we passed legislation to give teachers the legal right to spank a child who needs it, as long as they follow local school board policies.
I remember many times when a little old-fashioned spanking got my attention.
Our return to common sense on corporal punishment will help our schools have a more disciplined learning environment and produce better citizens.
We found some schools were short on textbooks and many school buses were old and in disrepair.
We now provide every student with a textbook for every required subject and we have purchased over 1,800 new school buses since 1995. wpe2.
jpg (21101 bytes)Three years ago there was not a comprehensive program to measure the basic academic skills of every student.
We now test students each year in grades 3-11 to determine if academic standards are being met.
If not, the local school authorities are given two years to correct the deficiencies.
If they fail to do so, the State Superintendent of Education takes over management of the school until the standards are met.
The Standford Achievement Tests were given last April, and Alabama students met or exceeded the national average in every subject in every grade.
Surely, a state that does not tolerate losing football programs should not tolerate losing academic programs.
So, let us not be content with meeting or beating the national average.
Let us not rest until our student’s performance leads the nation.
I said in my first Inaugural Address, almost 20 years ago, that our classroom teachers are the infantry in the war on illiteracy and tonight I am deeply grateful for their good work as evidenced by test score results.
I sense excitement and determination not only by our teachers, but also by school secretaries, custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and maintenance workers to make our schools the best in America.
I share their excitement and I am pleased to propose a salary increase of 8.5 percent for all education personnel.
This will raise teachers’ salaries from an average of $31,000 in 1995 to an average of $36,000 in 1998, an increase of 16 percent that will enable us to attract and retain good teachers.
As we know, there is no tougher job than principal or superintendent.
They bear responsibility for the performance of each school and of the entire system.
We appreciate and applaud the leadership of Dr. Ed Richardson and all of our local superintendents and principals.
The Finance Department has informed me that the State of Alabama is due some $1.5 billion dollars as a result of overpayments to the Teachers Retirement Fund, and the pay back will be in the form of annual reductions in retirement contributions made by the state.
This is a windfall of mammoth proportions.
Let us not foolishly spend this money.
Let us put it to good use by investing in Alabama’s future.
I can think of no better use for this windfall than providing the best in education facilities and setting up a Merit Scholarship Fund that will serve generations to come.
I propose we commit $50 million of the windfall annually over the next 20 years, which in addition to continuation of current debt service, will underwrite a $1 billion Education Bond Issue.
Of this, $576 million will be dedicated to K-12.
I also propose legislation that will authorize local boards of education to use their share of the public school fund created in the first year of this administration to support a capital improvements bond issue of up to $850 million.
Those two issues, when combined, total $1.4 billion and will fund the replacement of any and all sub-standard classroom facilities, permanent or portable.
I call this to your attention -- a sub-standard classroom is a sub-standard classroom, period.
Funds will be available to connect every school to the statewide network known as Intranet to provide state-of-the-art technology to the classrooms of Alabama.
I propose also, the establishment of an Alabama Merit Scholarship Fund endowed with $35 million of windfall revenue this year and $65 million in each of the next four years.
This fund will have a corpus of $300 million and create more than 8,000 scholarships for Alabama students to attend college in their home state.

jpg (31149 bytes) As you know, from time to time, I have gently insisted that the heads of our two-year and four-year institutions examine their priorities and expenditures and take action to ensure program viability and efficiency.
With limited resources, good stewardship is the only way to guarantee long-term quality in undergraduate and post-graduate work, to strengthen our research capabilities and to meet the ever- increasing need for multiple skills job training.
A need that clearly reflects competitive demands in today’s ever-changing global market.
I recently received reports from Dr. Tom Meredith, chancellor of the University of Alabama System and Dr. Bill Muse, president of Auburn University.
Dr. Meredith has initiatives underway to address the maintenance of quality as well as increasing efficiencies.
He has eliminated 102 academic programs from the system inventory over the last five years and more are on the way.
Dr. Meredith has created a joint purchasing alliance among his three universities that should produce at least $10 million in annual savings.
For example, UAB and University of Alabama bid their mainframe computer together this year and saved $1.3 million.
Dr. Muse reports several significant areas of cost reduction the last two years.
He has eliminated 270 full-time positions in non-teaching posts and 10 specialists in education degree programs by combining 11 programs into one.
He has out-sourced the Drake Student Health Center, eliminating a $466,000 budget deficit and saving at least $675,000 annually.
I believe management is trying to improve efficiency in our two and four-year institutions.
I appreciate the work by Dr. Muse and Dr. Meredith and the good example they have set.
I will propose legislation to fund a salary increase of 8.5 percent for all personnel in higher education whose salaries are paid from the Education Trust Fund.
Furthermore, I propose the following amounts for higher education: First, $88 million for capital improvement for post-secondary education to provide a skilled work force.
A minimum of $50 million must be used to meet the demonstrated needs of the manufacturing industries and the health care delivery systems in the state.
An oversight committee with representatives from education, business, health and labor will be established to ensure wise use of funds.
Secondly, because agri-business is a cornerstone of our economy and industries such as Charoen Pokphand, a new poultry processing operation employing 1,500 people in Barbour and surrounding counties, need research support, I propose $52 million dollars to provide animal and poultry diagnostic laboratories, agricultural and forestry research, and instructional and research facilities for veterinary medicine.
Thirdly, $10 million to provide adequate facilities for education, training, and research in the forensic sciences, a major component in solving criminal cases.
Finally, $300 million to provide capital improvements for public institutions of higher education.
Education is more than an ideal.
"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be the teaching of all children of the state reading, writing and common arithmetic."
Together, as parents, grandparents, educators and lawmakers, let us now take the necessary steps to make Alabama’s public education system second to none.
"Jefferson also founded the University of Virginia and said it would be, ""… based on the unlimited freedom of the human mind, to explore and to expose every subject susceptible of its contemplation."
We would do well to adopt his vision for our very own.

jpg (21745 bytes)In my General Fund proposal, I again emphasize children’s services.
Last year as part of our Children’s Initiative, I requested an additional $5 million for Foster Family Enhancements, but you appropriated only $1 million.
I again ask you to support a $5 millionappropriation for foster children.
I propose a $10 million appropriation to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program to provide coverage for an estimated 50,000 children, and an $8 million increase to Youth Services for additional private placements.
In total, I am requesting over $30 million new dollars for Children’s initiatives.
We have increased the ranks of Public Safety by over 200 troopers.
We have increased our prison capacity by over 3,000 inmates, to ensure no criminal who should be locked up will be set free.
For three years we have run state government and increased funding for children, for prisons, for law enforcement, and for Medicaid ---- but with no new taxes and very little growth in General Fund revenue.
We did this primarily with a freeze on hiring that through attrition reduced the number of state employees from 39,000 in December of 1994 to 35,000 in December of 1997, reducing payroll costs by approximately $100 million dollars.
Cabinet members and state employees have worked hard to cut expenses in purchasing, contracting, communications, and travel and I thank them for making state government more efficient, and for saving the taxpayer millions of dollars.
(Mr. Main – Mr. Baker- Cabinet) I propose an 8 percent pay raise for state employees funded from savings created by two early retirement plans.
Therefore, the pay raise and early retirement legislation should be tied together.
"I have said before and I say again, ""Honest government begins with honest elections."
You passed our absentee ballot law last year, now I ask you to complete the job by passing Voter ID.
I want to thank Secretary of State Jim Bennett and Attorney General Bill Pryor for their good work on this bill.
Again, I submit to you a constitutional amendment granting the people of Alabama the right of Initiative and Referendum, a concept that has enriched democracy in many states since 1902.
The primary responsibility of any government is to protect its citizens from violence and crime.
Violent crime is down 18 percent, but we need to drive it down further.
I think Attorney General Bill Pryor’s crime package will do exactly that.
First, Alabama is the only state where the death penalty has a mandatory, two-stage appellate review and we need only to provide one automatic appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court.
Secondly, legislation needs to be passed that prohibits bail on appeal.
Thirdly, we need a better system for communicating juvenile crime information between law enforcement officers and school officials.
Fourthly, we need legislation to strengthen the Sexual Violent Predator law by confining any sexually violent predator who is still a danger to society.
And finally, we need several modifications to improve our Community Notification Law.
I urge you to pass these bills and strengthen Alabama’s criminal justice system.
Welfare reform is working.
Since 1996, Family Assistance caseloads are down by 36 percent.
Food stamp caseloads have dropped by 15 percent.
For the second year, DHR has broken all records for child support collections – over $192 million in 1997.
Let me recognize your former colleague, Tony Petelos and commend him for a good start at the helm of the Department of Human Resources.
I now report on jobs.
The second best year for industrial investments in state history was 1995, exceeded only by 1981.
The two-year average for 1995 and 1996 was the highest for industrial investments in state history.
The 1997 unemployment rates are the lowest in state history.
Alabama is known worldwide as a good place to do business.
British Steel, U. S. Gypsum, Boeing, Michelin, Mercedes and countless other companies, large and small, attest to that fact.
Industrial activity whether new or expanding thrives in a state where basic infra-structure is solid; good schools and good roads.
We are building good schools.
Now, I propose a $700 million Highway Bond Issue to build and widen roads vital to our economic growth and job creation, and to the safety and convenience of our citizens; $170 million for counties; $300 million dollars for bridges and resurfacing; $300 million to accelerate construction of the Five Year Plan as approved by the Joint Highway Committee.
Alabama State Parks are one of our greatest assets.
Thousands of Alabamians enjoy the parks, which are also one of our greatest tourist attractions.
Therefore, I propose a $100 million bond issue to put our park facilities in top shape.
Again, I ask you to enact a tort reform package that consists of six bills aimed at addressing the fairness of the civil justice system.
I particularly direct your attention to the need for a strong criminal fraud bill so that those who would swindle will know that they will face severe punishment.
I also ask you to enact caps on punitive damages that are set at levels that are based in part on the size of a business.
Five bills dealing with tort reform have passed the House on two prior occasions.
I call on the Lieutenant Governor to FOCUS.
FOCUS the attention of the Senate on Tort Reform so that each bill gets a vote on the Senate floor.
"No ""ifs, ands or buts,"" about it---FOCUS!"
I come now to the issue of federalism, a unique American concept that guarantees our freedom by separating the powers of government.
"The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution is very clear, ""Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise, thereof."
Therefore, when a state or federal court--- a part of the non-lawmaking judicial branch of government, rules that an establishment of a national religion has occurred by posting the Ten Commandments on a courtroom wall without surrounding them with so-called historical items, or presenting a nativity scene in school without surrounding it with non-religious items such as Santa Claus, or offering a pre-game prayer by coaches and players or praying for the safety of our soldiers in harm’s way by a class at school, or acknowledging God at a graduation ceremony without calling undue attention to God, such court has violated the U. S. Constitution to which you and I and all the Judges have taken an oath of office to uphold.
"The Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution reads, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
"In my first administration, I defended three teachers in Mobile who were sued because they said a blessing in the school cafeteria, ""God is great, God is good, let us thank Him for our food."
"At that time, Leon Jaworski, one of America’s foremost constitutional authorities, wrote me as follows: "" I have long felt that leaning on the Fourteenth Amendment for support in depriving the states from determining the propriety of religion in public schools is an abomination."
It distorts the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and prostitutes its use.
A brilliant and courageous Federal Judge, Brevard Hand, followed the Constitution and ruled in our favor, and dismissed the case for lack of federal jurisdiction.
Yes, Judge Hand was subsequently overruled by the U. S. Supreme Court by an 8 to 1 vote.
The dissenting vote in our favor was cast by Justice William Rehnquist, now Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court.
Today, across this land governors, U. S. Congressmen, U. S. Senators, State legislators, legal scholars, and the people are deeply concerned over reckless, illegal, and arrogant rulings by our imperial judiciary.
I will be true to my conscience and my oath of office and resist illegal usurpation of authority by any court with all legal and political means I can muster.
I ask you to join me in this resistance.
I have outlined a strong agenda for Alabama.
This legislative program is good for our families, and good for our future.
Our commitment to Alabama in its 179th year should be to leave all partisan interests at the door.
For this must be the place where the public interest rules and those we serve will be better for it.
Let us get the job done.
I wish you the best in this session.
Thank you and God bless Alabama.
