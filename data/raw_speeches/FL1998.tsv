President Jennings, Speaker Webster, members of the Supreme Court, my partner and friend, Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay, members of the Cabinet, members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, my fellow Floridians: Last week, the worst string of tornadoes ever to hit Florida slashed across our state -- with winds up to 210 miles an hour.
The Mayor of Kissimmee told me of the outpouring of help and support for his people.
He was appreciative of the quick response of the state emergency system and FEMA.
I'd like to express our concern for all those who suffered losses in this storm and to thank the people and businesses who have given so much of themselves to help others in need.
Our people who work on the emergency preparedness team, both at the state and county level, are the best in the country.
Since Hurricane Andrew, FEMA, under James Lee Witt, has reinvented itself.
FEMA makes a tremendous contribution to our communities when disaster strikes.
I am happy today to report that the State of the State looks very strong.
Jobs are up, unemployment and crime are down, and we're preserving our fragile ecosystems, including the jewel in our crown -- the Florida Everglades.
We've begun to build a solid economic foundation for this state.
Wall Street has recognized this effort -- and Florida now has the highest bond rating in our history -- double-A-plus.
You and I created Enterprise Florida and our tourism partnership Visit Florida.
These public/private partnerships have become our engine for creating jobs.
They've been road tested and are firing on all cylinders.
Florida is creating jobs faster than any other state in the nation.
Last year was our best year ever for tourism.
International trade is growing by double digits each year and is now valued at $63.4 billion.
WELFARE REFORM We've cut our welfare caseload by nearly half.
Participants who go to work, can keep part of their cash grant, receive two years transitional child care and get education and training.
We've now put the incentives on the side of work, not welfare dependency.
One fact to remember -- the more successful we are, the harder our job becomes.
Families remaining on welfare will need more intensive services to move from welfare to work.
We must continue to take the savings from the declining welfare rolls and invest in child care and the support services families need.
Our business-oriented state WAGES board and the 24 community-based WAGES coalitions are a great example of our partnering with the private and local sectors.
EDUCATION We are all aware of the importance of education and the role education must play to provide Florida with the skilled work force we need for the next century.
The Governor's Commission on Education, on which a number of you serve with other Florida leaders, is addressing some very important areas.
Last year, the Commission sounded the alarm about school overcrowding.
The public responded.
We witnessed an outpouring of concern during the special session.
Many predicted we'd get nowhere.
But, we came together to curb school overcrowding.
As your governor, I'd like to say to each of you -- thank you.
It was an important step.
Mr. Speaker, Madam President, thank you for your cooperation.
The Education Commission recognized the merits of Blueprint 2000 -- a comprehensive school improvement and accountability system.
And that we've adopted world-class standards for our students -- the Sunshine State standards.
Our schools are improving.
The list of critically low performing schools has dropped from 158 to 30 since 1995.
Commissioner Brogan deserves credit for his leadership in this area.
"However, the members of the study commission raise the question: ""What happens when the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test scores become binding, and we are faced with holding students back?"
"Will we hold fast and not retreat?"""
To hold fast, we'll have to provide teachers and students with the support and tools they need.
We must commit ourselves to provide that remedial help now.
TEACHERS Our colleges and universities must change their curriculum to produce teachers prepared for today's challenges.
And we must re-train many of our current teachers.
We should recognize and reward top-quality teachers.
We should encourage more teachers to receive national certification -- and pay them better when they achieve it.
TEXTBOOKS/TECHNOLOGY During the special session last fall, you provided $250 for every teacher in Florida.
This money will help pay for the paper and classroom supplies that too often came out of our teacher's pockets.
That was a good idea.
We must also continue to fund books and materials.
This year we should provide an additional $24.5 million to fully fund this item.
For today's kids, a computer is vital to their learning.
The Internet is a gateway to a whole universe of knowledge.
This morning, Florida school children are watching us live on the Internet.
Later today, Buddy and I will talk with kids via the World Wide Web.
Kids, I'm glad you're tuning in.
There is a lot going on here that will affect you, your families and your schools.
I'm hoping this legislative session will be dedicated to you.
But, only a quarter of our classrooms have access to the Internet.
We increased funding for classroom technology by 43 percent over the past two years.
This year, let's continue that effort.
SCHOOL HEALTH NURSES A kid who's sick can't learn.
Yet, Florida ranks 48th in student to school nurse ratio.
If it wasn't for Louisiana and Mississippi, we'd be dead last.
When a child has a medical problem, and there's no one to turn to, often mom has to leave her job and come take the child home.
Many times, that's not warranted.
When we were growing up, most schools had a nurse.
They were there for minor scrapes or major emergencies.
Much has changed, but the need for school nurses has not.
Let's provide our school children with more nurses.
HIGHER EDUCATION Florida still does not provide higher education opportunities to enough of our Florida kids.
This year we must increase that number.
It's fair to ask parents to pick up 25 percent of tuition if we provide sufficient needs-based scholarships.
Let's keep the doors of higher education open for all our kids.
We also must work to keep Florida's merit scholars in our universities.
READINESS The most compelling product of the Education Commission is the Readiness Committee's report -- adopted unanimously by the full commission.
I'm sending each of you a copy.
I'm also sending a copy of the speech delivered at the 1998 Children's Summit by the chair of the committee, David Lawrence, publisher of The Miami Herald.
I urge you to read these insightful comments.
They show that the readiness of our kids, zero to five, is Florida's Achilles Heel.
This session we can make major strides to improve readiness by addressing child care and health care for our children.
CHILD CARE Balancing the needs of work and raising children is an every day challenge for many of our state's families.
Last year, you provided child care for our WAGES moms.
But, there are thousands of working moms who have not gone on welfare but can't afford child care.
They toughed it out.
Let's use our WAGES savings to provide child care for 26,000 of their kids.
There are two other steps we can take to improve the quality of child care.
First, we should require background checks of any child care provider who receives government funds.
We must ensure our kids are safe.
Second, we should increase the number of Gold Seal child care centers in Florida.
This good program you've created assures parents their children are in a truly quality center.
To date there are 550 Gold Seal centers now -- let's increase that number by at least 300.
CHILDREN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE This year we have an unprecedented opportunity to provide health care coverage for our infants, pre-schoolers and students.
Using new federal funds plus our tobacco victory dollars we can provide health insurance for 300,000 uninsured children.
That's 10,000 classrooms full of kids.
Now, health care for these children comes only at the emergency room.
This morning, I was escorted into the chamber by some of the newest members of the Florida Healthy Kids program.
Nine-year-old Amanda Anderson -- is a third grader here at Chaires Elementary.
She had a serious heart condition that required open heart surgery just days after birth.
Luckily, at that time, her parents had health insurance.
But Amanda's mama lost her husband and her family health insurance.
On Sunday, Amanda became one of Leon County's first enrollees in Healthy Kids.
With your help, more children like Amanda will receive the coverage they need to stay healthy and do better in school.
We know kids in every school district should have that chance.
Thank you Representative Albright and Senator Myers for the work your committees are doing to bring this about.
TOBACCO VICTORY We're able to afford this children's health care plan, in part, because of our victory against Big Tobacco.
This fight was for children.
When we brought the nation's strongest lawsuit against cigarette makers, the odds were against us.
Tobacco had never paid a dime to anyone.
We won an historic settlement.
Today, there are no longer any tobacco billboards or transit ads in Florida.
No Joe Camel, no Marlboro Man or Virginia Slims models looking down at our kids.
And we won $11.3 billion over the first 25 years.
$419 million is now in the state treasury.
The settlement earmarked $200 million for an anti-smoking campaign to protect our kids from years of aggressive and deceptive marketing.
Big Tobacco spends more than $14 million each day selling its products.
By the time a teen turns 14, they've already been exposed to $20 billion of tobacco advertising.
For years we've done nothing to counter that.
Unless we act, we know that 300,000 of Florida's children will one day die of a tobacco-related disease.
But, if we reduce youth tobacco use by just one percent -- we can save the lives of 10,000 children.
ONLY a substantial program can succeed.
An under-funded program is doomed to failure -- and that plays directly into the hands of Big Tobacco.
Let's fund this program the right way -- not half way.
Our kids lives are at stake.
We have held meetings with local anti-smoking coalitions.
We have selected an advertising team.
And on March 29th, 500 teens from all over Florida will come together in Haines City to plan our attack against tobacco.
Teens know best how to talk to teens.
And since the day of the settlement, they've been advising us on what works best.
Florida will be the first state to give teens a major role in the fight against tobacco.
And from what I've seen, Big Tobacco is in for a big surprise.
TOBACCO PREEMPTION There's another thing we can do to free our people from the dangers of smoking.
A few years ago we extended Florida's Clean Indoor Air Act to ensure public areas are smoke free.
But today, the Act represents the most a community can do to clear the air.
The state has choked local efforts to provide cleaner air for their citizens and that's not fair.
This is a home rule issue.
New York City provides us with strong evidence that the restaurant and tourism business can thrive when the air is cleared.
Florida's communities deserve the opportunity to strengthen their clean air laws.
Let's remove the preemption clause.
Let's let communities decide what's best.
Florida has long been known as the Sunshine State.
Madam President, I agree with you.
Let's work together to make Florida the Fresh Air State.
We can get this done this year.
GUN VIOLENCE In 1996, 190 Florida kids died as a result of guns in our communities.
Last year, Representative Miller's son Trey was shot in the shadow of the Capitol.
He was one of five random victims shot during a graduation party.
Those shots hit very close to home for all of us -- but unfortunately, gun violence in our society has become background noise.
We need to change that.
Two of our outstanding local officials -- Orange County chair Linda Chapin and Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas -- are crying out for our support.
They're telling us: If the state's not going to act, then allow us to do it.
We should help them.
Let's close the loophole in our gun laws and make gun shows play by the same rules as retail stores and pawn shops.
We should require background checks and a waiting period for gun show purchases.
This is the year to take a stand on gun violence.
Too many of our kids live in fear of guns on our school yards and in their neighborhoods.
Let's give them a greater measure of safety.
CHILD ABUSE When a child dies from abuse and neglect, we are all outraged.
We all feel the black eyes, bruises and broken bones.
Last year, 116 children died from abuse and neglect in our state.
During one tragic week in September, five children died from child abuse.
In each of these cases, the warning signs were there.
These are our children.
If you and I don't protect them, who will?
We must fund 200 new child protective investigators and provide all of them with better supervision and training.
And we also must work at the front end.
Healthy Families, established in 1992, now operates in FIVE counties: Pinellas, Orange, Hillsborough, Duval, Polk.
It provides home visits, parent education and child development programs for at-risk families.
We see incredible statistics about families involved in this innovative program: More than 96 percent experience no abuse or neglect.
It's working.
Let's expand Healthy Families statewide this year.
ADOPTION Another program that's working to build Florida's families is our effort to promote adoption.
We now provide a free college tuition to adopted foster kids.
"Using the adoption hotline, our Internet homepage, and a new public awareness campaign, we're encouraging more families to, in the words of our campaign slogan: ""Get a Life."
The Governor's Adoption Partnership will begin an intensive campaign this summer.
Let's back up this effort to find permanent homes for more foster kids by increasing the Maintenance Adoption Subsidy.
CLOSE: We have a few members here for their first session.
Forty years ago I was here as a member of the House for my first session.
It was an incredible time to be a member.
Florida was in the last throes of the Pork Chop rule when Senators and House members represented pine trees -- not people.
I recall a House member being kicked out of the Pork Chop gang because he cast a vote of conscience to allow Broward County, then our fastest growing county to have four representatives rather than three.
The Federal Court reapportioned us and the top guns of the house moved to the Senate and a new class in the House included a Graham and a D'Alemberte.
It was a renaissance time.
Florida burst forth from a rural, Southern state to an urban, major player.
After four years in the State Senate, I took a walk and not only did I get elected to the U. S. Senate, I learned to listen.
It was lonesome when I started walking the Panhandle, and I found people would walk with me longer if I listened rather than talked.
And I learned a lot when I listened.
After 18 years in the Senate, (the job I'd wanted since I was 10 years old), I broke my pick on the budget and I came home disgusted and ready to hang it up.
Two years later, I was elected Governor, the one job I never coveted.
I don't know what I did to deserve it but being Florida's governor has been the most exciting and rewarding experience of my life.
I know this sounds like a nostalgia trip, but that's not what I'm about.
I have some things after these 40 years that I want to share with you.
The Florida I see today is more exciting than the old Florida I described.
We are more diverse than ever before.
The voices we hear in the neighborhoods of Overtown and Little Havana -- of Orlando and Apalachicola -- these are the voices of a new Florida.
And though they may speak with different tongues, we share one voice.
Florida is poised to lead in the next millennium by allowing all our people to have a seat at the table -- to be a part of our engine.
To do so, we must fix our children, We must fix our inner cities.
We must fix our rural blights -- and preserve our environment.
Dr. John Hope Franklin is a remarkable man.
He's the Chairman of the President's Commission on Human Relations.
He was here last week and he told me about an article he wrote titled The Land of Room Enough.
We must make Florida the Land of Room Enough.
Or we can continue to live off of our sunshine and location and be a state of haves and have nots -- with the haves forced to hide behind their locked gates.
You will have a lot to do with making these calls.
I can't tell you all the answers but, I can tell you .
Trust the people.
They really care about our state -- about our people.
They will respond if you tell them what you truly believe.
You don't have to put a spin on it.
Be willing to hang out on something you really believe.
The way to achieve leadership is to learn more about your subject than anyone else and to work harder.
You don't have to look for short cuts.
Part of your contract with the people entitles them to have you vote your honest convictions of what you think is best for them.
You must take that risk, but remember the only vote you can explain is a vote you believed in.
Be bold -- dare to look foolish.
Reach beyond your grasp and go beyond the path you can see.
I have the utmost respect for the representative office you hold and for the people you represent.
I truly envy the exciting but awesome task you face.
I wish you Godspeed.
