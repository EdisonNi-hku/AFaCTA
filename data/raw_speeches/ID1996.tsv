sentences
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Supreme Court, distinguished elected officials, members of the 53rd Idaho Legislature, and fellow Idahoans: Welcome back.
Let me invite all of you to a reception in my office immediately after I finish here today.
I look forward to greeting you in person.
What a privilege it is to live in Idaho.
We have it all: bountiful natural assets; productive farms, mines, and forests; cutting-edge industries; skilled and hard-working people; and freedom from governmental excesses.
We lead the nation in our youthful vigor and dynamic collective personality.
Idaho’s future is bright -- but only if we are wise.
What is wise is not always easy.
We must provide jobs for our young people so they need not look elsewhere.
Yet we must also protect our state’s beauty and recreational value.
"Here quality of life is one of our dearest treasures, even if we do not always agree on what ""quality of life"" means."
Our wildlife population is diverse, and the decline of any species is a major concern.
At the same time, we must be practical and not inflict unnecessary economic pain on ourselves.
We are a little over a century into our statehood.
Future shock is no longer in the future.
The changes all around us are astounding, and we must adapt.
Perhaps the most far-reaching change in 1996 will be a revolution in the relationship between state and federal governments.
Our national government, after experimenting with stifling regulatory excesses and income redistribution for half a century, is wisely changing direction.
It is following Idaho’s lead in becoming more frugal with our tax dollars.
Idaho has always balanced its budget, and now Congress and President Clinton must do the same.
We cannot continue to pile back-breaking debt on our children and grandchildren.
Once Congress acts, we will see striking changes in how states meet governmental obligations.
We will see a decline in the growth of money available for health, welfare, and other social programs.
We will also see more flexibility.
We need leeway to carefully allocate our funds in a way that fits Idaho, even as we cast off rigid and wasteful federal rules.
We had a glimpse into the new federal-state fiscal arrangement early last year.
Federal funds for employment security were sharply reduced.
My predecessor’s budget called for state general funds to finance the Department of Employment for the first time.
"My administer, Roger Madsen, with my concurrence, said ""No -- we will live within our remaining budget."
Roger trimmed staff, practiced some innovative cost-cutting, and delivered the same services for less money -- and no state dollars.
That is a model for what we in Idaho can and will do as we take over responsibility from Washington D. C. MEETING THE CHALLENGE Getting ready for this challenge has been my top priority this past year.
The first step in preparing was to make sure our own house was in order.
I began by visiting each department of state government.
I took 47 tours, each averaging a couple of hours.
I wanted to see how state employees serve the people of Idaho.
Here’s what I found out: First, as complicated as our state government is, it seems to be working well.
Second, the reason it works well is the high quality of our state employees.
They are hard-working, intelligent, and enthusiastic about my goal to reduce the size and scope of government.
In fact, state employees have come up with many ideas for consolidation and efficiencies.
And third, it will keep on working well even when we look at costs and benefits.
I asked my new department heads to scour their budgets to look for savings -- both large and small.
This did not attract page one headlines, but it has been tremendously successful.
Here are a few examples: I already mentioned the Department of Employment’s loss of federal funds.
Despite that, the department is performing better than ever.
Recently, and for the first time this decade, the Unemployment Insurance program met federal quality standards.
The Department of Administration has been aggressive in cutting costs for all of state government.
We saved $681,000 by refinancing bonds for buildings.
Rental costs for buildings managed by the department have dropped.
Common sense policies put into place by Director Pam Ahrens have lowered the state’s energy costs 4.5 percent this year.
The state put its long-distance telephone contract out to competitive bid -- and we expect a drop of $700,000 next year.
We did the same with our Internet contract, saving $21,000.
At Idaho State School and Hospital, work-release inmates from the penitentiary have taken over laundry and groundskeeping functions, saving the state $100,000.
At Orofino, inmates remodeled a 100-bed project at the Idaho Correctional Institution, saving $520,000.
In fact, inmate crews worked a total of 271,000 hours last year, earning $1,300,000 for the Department of Corrections.
That’s money taxpayers did not have to spend on the black hole of our prison budget.
In the next few weeks I will bring you several proposals to ease the toll of Corrections on our state revenues.
Any change must be made with the utmost caution and with the safety of our citizens foremost in mind.
We also turned many government-run enterprises over to the private sector.
Corrections is privatizing medical services.
BSU is contracting student health services.
"The Department of Health and Welfare has created ""Community Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities,"" removing the state from direct services and opening doors to more than 150 providers."
Other areas for privatization include refugee, child support, and mental health services.
"A year ago that I called for ""common sense"" solutions -- and that’s what I got."
I said I wanted government to be a servant, and not a master -- and I got that, too.
The Department of Insurance now resolves most consumer complaints against insurers by telephone, rather than requiring written complaints.
This significantly cuts the time it takes to get consumers the help they need.
The Industrial Commission, the State Insurance Fund, and the Department of Employment used to require employers to fill out forms for all three agencies.
Now they have combined these into one form -- a one-stop shop.
Three more agencies -- the PUC, Transportation, and the Tax Commission -- share a form cut down from 18 to 2 pages.
A citizen who wants to register for motor carriers and some renewals can apply at any one of the agencies, and the information will be shared with the other two.
The Department of Insurance has reduced from about eight months to less than 30 days the time it needs to approve or disapprove applications from insurance companies that want to do business in Idaho.
The Division of Environmental Quality streamlined its permitting process to let a business know in as little as 15 days whether it qualifies for a desired permit -- and still kept its standards high.
We expanded our program for electronic filing of individual income tax returns.
Now more than 95 percent of Idahoans can save time and money filing this way.
Today you can buy a hunting or fishing license electronically.
You can pay fees electronically.
You can look up state regulations on the Internet.
You can even find out what my schedule is for the day.
By the end of my tenure, I hope every report and every application can be filed electronically with the state of Idaho.
Pam Ahrens will see to it.
GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION We can do more, of course.
What served us well 50 years ago may not do the job anymore.
In a time of change, departmental reorganization is always on the agenda.
The Department of Agriculture saved $250,000 by consolidating management.
We have tried to carry out the demand of the Legislature that the Quality Assurance lab be self-supporting.
It will remain closed until it can operate on a fully qualified basis without general funds.
At law enforcement, director Bob Sobba brought to state government the philosophy he implemented as Caldwell’s police chief.
His reorganization cut back layers of management, putting two more troopers on the road and two more criminal investigators working to protect the public.
We have successfully combined the administrative functions of the departments of Insurance and Finance, a move that will save taxpayers $180,000 next year.
The four-headed Tax Commission I helped put into law is not an effective management arrangement.
I will put together a committee to devise legislation that manages the state’s taxing function like other departments in state government.
Finally, after long and careful consideration, I recommend that we combine the Department of Labor and Industrial Services with the Department of Employment.
Let me be clear: this does not change the state’s commitment to making sure labor is not cheated.
A worker must receive promised wages and benefits on time, must be provided a safe workplace, must not be forced to despoil the environment or work extra time without pay.
My recommendation is to combine the Wage and Hour Division of DLIS with the Department of Employment.
This new agency will be named the Department of Labor and Employment.
Roger Madsen will be its director.
The regulatory function of the current DLIS -- that is, the electrical, plumbing, and building inspection functions -- will be self-governed and located within the existing structure for self-governing agencies.
This move will provide for better management.
It will save us some money.
And most importantly, it will provide better services to labor.
I urge you to help me make this change.
One year ago, we stopped the growth of state government in its tracks.
Today we have 100 fewer employees in state government than last year at this time.
We stopped finding new ways to spend money.
Instead, we found new ways to save money.
We returned that surplus to its rightful owners: Idaho’s taxpayers.
PROPERTY TAX RELIEF Last year we provided Idahoans the largest tax relief in the state’s history.
In addition, we put a three percent cap on the growth of local budgets.
I am gratified to report to you today that Idahoans did see property tax relief this year.
Property taxes increased only an average of 1.9 percent statewide -- the smallest increase in 15 years.
Many people actually saw a decrease in their bills.
This was so despite the fact that valuation increases continued to climb into the double digits.
That $42 million property tax relief will be ongoing.
Yet we still hear strong cries for further tax relief.
It is likely we will see another one percent property tax initiative on the ballot.
If it is adopted, our present tax system will not adequately fund all our obligations.
There are several proposals floating about to have the state pay all or part of future school construction.
Proponents of such plans are obligated to put the cost on the table.
In every case, they require raising taxes or diverting funds from an already frugal budget.
Others want to make it easier to pass bond issues by lowering the two-thirds majority requirement.
That is not the solution.
When schools make a good case for their needs, voters approve bonds and override levies.
Whatever the proposal, one thing is clear: there is no free lunch.
Each proposal comes at the expense of something else.
Idahoans already work four months each year just to pay taxes and we must be absolutely honest about any plan that would extend that period.
WELFARE REFORM We spent much of the past year planning for changes that we know are coming from the federal government.
Compared to other states, Idaho does not have a large welfare population.
Yet our caseload grew 50 percent and nearly doubled in price during the last four years.
These increases constituted an alarming trend -- not only in dollars spent, but in a rising toll on human lives and souls.
Even if the federal government were not considering its own welfare reform initiative, it was time in Idaho to do just that.
Last spring I put a committee together and gave it the job of coming up with a welfare reform package to present to this Legislature.
I commend the Governor’s Welfare Reform Advisory Council for its dedication, for its thoroughness, and for its speed in meeting the deadline I set.
The council traveled the entire state twice, first asking for ideas and then asking for reaction to specific suggestions.
Close to 600 people showed up or wrote letters.
Today, I am proud to present all of the council’s 44 recommendations to you for consideration.
These recommendations will reform Idaho’s Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program.
The biggest change is from a system that encourages dependency to one that encourages independence by involving participants in a planned program of preparing for self-sufficiency.
I am most proud of the work requirements in these proposals.
All participants will be engaged in a work program in order to be eligible for benefits.
This work ethic will prepare them to return to the work force -- and to control of their own lives.
I hope to realize savings in these programs.
But more than that, I want to give people a chance to be contributors and producers, and to regain their dignity.
The council recommends a 3-year program: two years of cash benefits, and another year of Medicaid and child care assistance for those who need it as they enter the work force.
The proposals also make it more difficult for deadbeat dads and moms to escape the system.
I cannot overemphasize how significant this is.
In 1995, Health and Welfare tried to collect nearly $179 million in child support.
We got about $51 million, and that was the best in the nation.
But our best falls short.
Think of what it would mean to families all over Idaho if we could capture all those dollars for the children who need them.
Think of what it would mean to the general fund if responsible parents met their obligations to their children, instead of relying on the state.
Under our proposals, people who do not pay child support will not be able to get a driver’s, fishing, or a hunting license.
Welfare recipients will have to cooperate in identifying the father of their child before receiving benefits.
Many of these changes can be made by rule.
Others require statutory change.
Regardless, I will present the entire package to you for your discussion and approval.
My one reservation is in requiring new employees to be reported in 30 days.
Maybe we can do that -- and maybe not.
Whatever happens at the federal level, I am confident Idaho’s approach will lessen the debilitation of the human spirit that comes from relying on welfare.
We also await word from the federal government on the issue of Medicaid.
The best we can hope for is a block grant with no strings attached.
Whatever the form, the state will have to adapt rapidly, and that may require a special session later this year.
In the meantime, I am appointing a special task force, modeled after the welfare reform council, to study, and ultimately rework, our Medicaid system.
We must convince Congress and the President to allow us the flexibility we need to cope with reduced resources.
PROTECTING AND RESTORING SOCIETY As governmental leaders, we must promote beneficial values.
Thrift, honesty, compassion, respect for the law, tolerance, and hard work cannot be legislated.
But they can be modeled, and we must make sure our actions reinforce those values.
I commend the State Board of Education for insisting that student-athletes must obey the law.
Schools that teach math, the sciences, and the arts must also encourage and demand ethical behavior.
But meaningful change can come only from parents who redouble their efforts to give sound guidance to their children.
We have too many students dropping out of school; too many boys and girls becoming parents; too many parents who let their children grow up without adequate supervision.
We pay a heavy price for the confusion our young people feel.
Juvenile crime has soared.
We responded by strengthening our juvenile justice system.
The cost is staggering, yet we already see some positive results.
We used to have young criminals moving to new parts of the state and entering new schools without anyone knowing what they had done.
A new statewide juvenile tracking system will put an end to that practice.
Young criminals will also be required to take part in restitution programs.
They need to realize that illegal actions have real and costly consequences.
The Department of Juvenile Corrections is working with the Department of Education to provide year-round schooling at its facilities, and with counties to develop local prevention programs.
Every youth we prevent from entering the state system saves us $50,000 per year.
Finally, we have also developed a process to reintegrate youth back into their communities.
Unfortunately, we may never be able to rehabilitate some young criminals.
But others can be successful and return to their communities as productive citizens.
While we concentrate on keeping our young folks from entering a life of crime, we must make one thing clear: no one will be allowed to victimize innocent people simply because of a deprived background.
A bad background is a bad excuse.
Everyone, regardless of roots, must obey the law.
We in Idaho will fund our prisons, our law enforcement programs, and our courts.
But this does not mean we will pamper those who thumb their noses at society.
We will not waste money on our jails in order to provide more than necessary amenities.
We will require hard work.
I commend Attorney General Lance for his drive to cut down on frivolous inmate lawsuits.
We need more prisoners who will repent their misdeeds and prepare for life outside prison, and we need fewer jailhouse lawyers.
EDUCATION The biggest budget item we have in Idaho is our education system We have a lot to be proud about: higher-than-average test scores, area vocational-technical colleges operating at capacity and with waiting lists, and a college and university system that offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate opportunities.
More recently, the State Board of Education has adopted three new policy directions that will pay dividends over the years.
First, the board’s new strategic plan makes innovative use of technology a top priority.
Information technology is exploding in growth.
Educational institutions that do not keep up will be totally inadequate.
Our students must have all the advantages of the computer age.
Whether this is a high school student in a small town studying advanced math through distance learning, or a college student taking that extra class off the Internet, or a place-bound father studying for a new career while he still supports his family, the potential seems limitless.
"In addition to what we are doing here in the state, Idaho is part of the SmartStates initiative of the Western Governors Association to create a so-called ""virtual university"" -- a high-tech school without walls that validates the quality of what people are learning in new and different ways."
Second, the board is making consumer-driven decisions.
In higher education, that means moving away from restrictive institutional role and mission statements, and instead responding to citizen and student needs in each region.
In vocational education, that means asking Idaho’s businesses and employers what they expect from these programs -- and then meeting those expectations.
In public school governance, that means abandoning rules that do not improve the quality of what happens in the classroom.
We should question whether standard classroom units, teacher-pupil ratios, tenure, accreditation, and historic school district boundaries are relevant to the information age.
And third, the board is looking at new ways to serve a wider range of Idahoans.
"A new School-to-Work initiative is intended to make education more relevant by linking what happens in school to the so-called ""real world"" of work or college or the military."
In an industrial age, the cookie-cutter education worked.
Now, in the information technology age, Idaho must harness these breath-taking changes to help students at every level think about the future and plan an education to reach those dreams.
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Our economy continues to grow, but at a slower pace than in previous years.
Bank mergers, downsizing in some of our high-tech companies, and a low timber supply have cost Idaho some jobs this year.
However, the Department of Commerce and our assets continue to bring businesses to Idaho.
We have added 19,000 new jobs to the state this year.
In Pocatello, Ballard Medical Products is building an $8 million facility and AMI is adding 200 new jobs.
Moore Business Forms in Jerome decided to stay on in Idaho, and now is expanding.
Here in the Treasure Valley, Micron Technology has added 2,511 jobs this year.
Rathdrum has attracted Bayshore Systems, a tool manufacturer.
We must be vigilant in ensuring that Idaho’s business climate remains competitive.
I recommend that we add a job retraining program to our package of business incentives, and will address this in detail on Wednesday during my budget presentation.
Our infrastructure needs must also keep pace with growth demands.
Our quality of life suffers when we spend our days in traffic jams or avoiding potholes on roads that have gone too long without repair.
Taxes are never popular, but the time has come when we must seek more money for roads and bridges.
This user fee has to keep pace with inflation in order to be effective.
I am fully behind the Interim Committee’s recommendations.
We must also stretch our tax dollars by seeking out more public-private partnerships such as the Isaac Canyon Interchange.
These opportunities require active leadership.
We will furnish that leadership.
Let us not forget that agriculture, forest products, and mining are still the backbone of our economy.
We are bedeviled by lumber imports from Canada.
We must rededicate ourselves to providing sufficient timber supplies for our sawmills so that we do not see a continued decline in employment.
Our mines continue to receive awards for their positive approach to the environment.
Existing mine companies are still providing assistance in cleaning up problems created long ago.
The Silver Valley restoration is a prime example of putting limited amounts of clean-up money to innovative and effective use.
One note of caution: if we put too much of a load on the mining industries, we will bankrupt them.
That is in no one’s best interests.
Our farm economy, with notable exceptions such as cattle, is doing reasonably well.
Our farms must be allowed to operate at a profit.
They provide a massive amount of the exports from Idaho.
In most cases they operate on small margins and can ill afford extra costs.
However, we cannot continue to exclude farm workers from Workers’ Compensation coverage.
These employees deserve the same protection as any other Idaho workers.
In many cases, injured farm workers become a burden to other taxpayers by receiving medical and welfare services.
My administration has sharply reduced the cost of Workers’ Compensation Insurance.
Farm coverage will cost 20 percent less than last year.
Now is the time to provide coverage for farm employees.
These hard-working Idahoans are among the most vulnerable of our citizens.
They are generally poor.
Few can afford a lawyer.
They work in a dangerous occupation.
They are the backbone of one of Idaho’s most productive economic assets.
We must stop ignoring this glaring deficiency in our society.
If it is necessary to give farmers relief from taxes somewhere else, let us determine where -- and get on with it.
Our workers can wait no longer.
ENVIRONMENT Agriculture, mining, the forest products industry, fishermen, boaters and other recreationists -- all depend on Idaho’s precious limited water supply.
In most years, we have no water to spare.
Let us put the anadromous fish question squarely on the table and come up with a sensible solution.
In spite of massive expenditures on waterflow experiments, the anadromous fish are still in critical condition.
There is no evidence that remedial measures have worked: not barging, not drawdowns, not increased flows and spills.
In the meantime, the impact on Idahoans has been serious indeed.
We will demand that any actions involving our water be based on sound science, be adequately monitored and evaluated, and reflect a necessary balance between the needs of fish and other affected Idaho interests.
After observing Dworshak Reservoir in a drawn-down condition, I can tell you that the reservoir is not feasible for recreation even when it is 30 feet below capacity.
The City of Orofino has suffered enough.
When the Corps of Engineers dammed the North Fork of the Clearwater, it promised local residents they would benefit from increased recreational activity.
Now the lake is being lowered beyond a usable level during the prime summer season.
This cannot continue.
We all want to restore the presence of the magnificent salmon runs to the Snake River drainage.
But let us concentrate on measures which may be successful and which do not bankrupt the entire Northwest.
If these fish are endangered, why not eliminate harvest entirely?
There are still drift nets taking them in the ocean.
Sport fishermen on the Pacific Coast catch salmon by the thousands.
In-stream salmon fishing is still permitted on the Columbia.
Sea otters, protected from population control, voraciously feed on the salmon when they leave the ocean and start up the river.
Modern science can surely devise successful passage around the dams that does not require enormous quantities of Idaho’s water.
Let’s focus on what will work, and drop consideration of unproven methods that will do great economic harm to Idaho.
"In June, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service classified the bull trout as ""warranted but precluded"" from listing by the Endangered Species Act."
At that time I said I would develop a comprehensive conservation strategy for the bull trout within the state of Idaho.
The Department of Fish and Game provided an important starting point for this effort.
My Bull Trout Conservation Plan will be available for public comment Jan. 15.
We must succeed in this recovery or face another endangered species crisis, similar to that of the spotted owl.
Water quality in Idaho’s rivers and streams is an important issue to all citizens across the state.
Our rivers, streams, and majestic lakes contribute significantly to the unique quality of life we all enjoy.
That is why, during the last legislative session, I signed Senate Bill 1284, a major piece of water quality legislation, into place.
With this new legislation, Idaho has embarked on a comprehensive water quality program that spans the state.
SB1284 will become the vehicle for the state to implement a water quality program that satisfies a court mandate and promises to protect our rivers and lakes.
NUCLEAR WASTE Last session this Legislature passed a resolution supporting my efforts to limit or prohibit permanent storage of radioactive waste at the INEL, and directing that the INEL be maintained as a center for research, development, and safety.
I carried out that mandate.
We now have a court-enforceable agreement that is unique in the nation.
Idaho is the envy of other states, in part because federal officials say no other state can expect such a pact.
For the first time in the history of Idaho, we have a federal court order that calls for removal of nearly all nuclear waste from the State of Idaho -- all the high-level and stored transuranic waste accumulated under my predecessors.
Removal will start within a few years and will be completed in 2035.
In addition, this court order prohibits the shipment of any commercial spent nuclear fuel to Idaho.
Right now Congress and the administration are frantically looking for a home for 92,000 loads of commercial spent nuclear fuel.
None of it will come to Idaho.
The word is out: Idaho is not going to be the nation’s dumpsite.
Last September the first-ever shipments of radioactive waste left Idaho for permanent disposal in Utah -- 10,000 pounds of radioactivity-contaminated lead.
Another 110,000 pounds will leave Idaho this year.
The agreement calls for nearly a billion dollars to be spent in transforming existing waste into a much more stable form and preparing it for shipment out of Idaho.
The agreement ensures level employment at the INEL, ending many years of uncertainty.
It provides funds for diversification of Eastern Idaho’s economy.
The critics of this agreement have distorted the facts and have appealed to raw emotions.
What we have in common is a wish that we did not have to deal with this issue.
Where we differ is that I did something about it.
They have fear on their side.
I have facts and the federal courts on mine.
If these critics had their way, this agreement would be canceled.
We would then be wide open to commercial waste -- but we would have no cleanup.
We would see a precipitous decline in jobs.
We would probably not see any spent fuel ever leave the state.
I am convinced that any legislative hearings you choose to have will bring to light the necessity of this agreement and the soundness of its terms.
I welcome full discussion of this court order because I am absolutely certain that what I did was in the best interest of Idaho.
Time will bear me out.
CONCLUSION Finally, let us be thankful for our people.
A few bizarre acts by a handful of strange people in Idaho have brought undeserved national attention to us.
Idaho is not a haven for bigotry, hatred, and violence.
The opposite is true.
Our crime rate is among the lowest in the nation.
The percentage of our population on welfare is the lowest in the nation.
We have strong communities with committed volunteers.
I will continue to set the record straight: Idaho is a warm and friendly state.
I hope you will do the same.
We can, and we will, continue to make economic progress.
We will widen our leading role in the production of electronic components for the Information Age.
We will continue our common-sense approach to government.
We will make our forests more useful, both for production and for recreation, under the model of our state land management.
We will harvest our minerals with decreased impact on our environment.
We will educate better, work smarter, and save and invest more productively.
We will rise to the challenge of accepting new responsibilities from Congress.
And as we deal with these awesome changes and responsibilities, let’s remember the reason that we must succeed -- and that is for our children and our children’s children.
I wish you could see the letters I get from them.
They tell me where they go and what they like.
They tell me about their homes and their classrooms.
They share their ideas for making Idaho a better place in which to live: asking me to organize a bicycle race for kids, suggesting that our relations with Canada would be better if the roads were less bumpy, arguing in favor of more drug rehabilitation centers.
A little girl asks us to quit using dams because they kill steelhead, and instead use big magnets.
They want speed bumps in their neighborhoods, and more police officers, and more helicopters to fight fires.
They care about so many things.
Listen to this letter from a 12-year-old: I have a question about the law and the freedom because I get confused.
because when I go camping with my family we see trash everywhere like the playgrounds, under the tables, in the trees, in the bathrooms, in the grass.
So can you help me on the freedom stuff, because people say they can do what they want to do, and freedom of speech so they say what they want to say.
This child, and all our other children, are our most precious resources.
They must have the attention of government.
But more important, they must receive adequate attention from society.
That child who writes of his confusion should not have to grow up with his questions unanswered.
We can all help him understand his rights and responsibilities in a free society.
Let us all rededicate ourselves to providing guidance and love and attention to our young folks.
They deserve it, and Idaho will suffer unless we provide it.
The cost of the disillusionment of our children is incalculable.
We must open our hearts, our minds, and our pocketbooks to making children feel wanted today -- and to help them become tomorrow’s productive and thoughtful citizens.
Together, we will all do credit to God’s special place, Idaho.
Thank you.
