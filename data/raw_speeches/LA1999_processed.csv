SENTENCES
"HONORED GUESTS, MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE, CITIZENS OF LOUISIANA Almost three decades ago, in the best selling book Future Shock, we were warned that the speed of change would overtake and challenge business, government and people in the future."
"If we don’t do everything we can to meet this challenge of change, then we will remain in a constant state of failure."
"This is the challenge we face as individuals, and this is the most acute challenge faced by our state."
"Adopting a standstill strategy only results in a business, a people or a state being left behind."
Being left behind means that failure becomes a reality.
"In 1996, Louisiana was in a state of failure.We were dead last."
"About this, there can be little debate."
"Together, we have done good work, so Louisiana is no longer a failure.We have our faults.We have our shortcomings."
"We have our problems, but we are not standing still."
Success cannot be measured by just considering where you are.
Success must be judged by considering how far you have come to get where you are.
"Over the last six years, we have come a very long way."
"Editorial pages are consumed by discussions about taxes, and claims that our taxes are too high."
The facts show the truth – we have some of the lowest taxes in the country.
"We are eliminating the death tax, we have cut payroll taxes, continued the phase-out of the inventory tax credit—and have had a net decrease in taxes during our administration."
These tax cuts have helped us hold state revenue growth to the rate of inflation over our term—far less than most other states or the federal government during the same time period.
The prestigious Bloomberg Annual Tax Survey has given Louisiana a grade of A- for overall tax friendliness and an A+ for tax friendliness to retirees.
Natchitoches has been named among the country’s top tax havens for retirees by Where To Retire Magazine.
The United States Census Bureau ranks Louisiana 45th in per capita taxation.
The people of forty-four other states wish their taxes would be as low as Louisiana’s.
"A lower tax burden is not enough, however."
We all agree that Louisiana needs a better economy with higher wages for our workers.
"Once again, the complainers who falsely say Louisiana is not attractive enough to business are selling our state short."
The work we have done the past six years has moved us forward.
"And again, the nation has recognized our progress."
"The Milken Institute’s New Economy Index shows that Louisiana is one of the fastest improving states in our nation, moving from 45th to 39th in economic environment in the last two years."
Louisiana was recently ranked the 4th best state in our nation for e-commerce by the Progressive Policy Institute…a reality few thought we could ever achieve.
Louisiana ranks in the top 20 for small-business friendly states according to last fall’s report from the Small Business Survival Center.
DeRidder was named among the Top 20 Small Towns for corporate facilities by Site Selection magazine last month.
Calcasieu Parish has been named one of the 50 hottest regions for business expansion and relocation in January’s Expansion Management journal.
Baton Rouge was ranked 3rd best mid-sized city for entrepreneurs in January’s Entrepreneur magazine.
New Orleans and Baton Rouge were just ranked among the nation’s top 20 “Wealth Builder” cities by the Brookings Institute.
"If you haven’t heard these things about Louisiana before, stop and ask yourselves why, and then see if you hear about them tomorrow."
"Our new staff at the Department of Economic Development is hard at work—helping Louisiana businesses expand, bringing new jobs to the state."
"When it comes to business—through civil law reform, business tax cuts, and fiscal restraint—Louisiana has never been friendlier."
We are no longer in the state of failure.
"We are moving up, keeping up, and we are even getting ahead."
"While we are doing much in business, we are doing even more in education."
"Unfortunately, in 1996, we inherited a broken educational system."
"Education is the most critical tool needed to meet the challenges of change, and our educational system ranked dead last."
"Together, we have done what no one thought we could do."
We have breathed life into this system.
"We have saved our educational system, and, more importantly, we are saving our children."
Louisiana has been recognized as one of the Top 10 states in the nation in overall education reform—and fourth best in standards and accountability.
"We have increased teacher pay by 35%, or $9500—the third fastest rate of increase in the South over the last six years."
"Other states are cutting education funding this year, but Louisiana teachers will again get a raise."
"Over the past five years, Louisiana has ranked fourth in the nation in the percentage we have increased funding for higher education."
National respect for our universities is also growing.
Confidence within our own state in our colleges has increased.
"And with the TOPS program and our community college system, more students than ever before are acquiring the education they need to succeed in the 21st century."
"During the past two weeks the University of South Carolina tried to recruit the Chancellor of our flagship university, LSU."
"Because he’s one of the four or five best in the country, and because of all the changes that you… and I… and he… have made together over these past few years, they wanted him."
He has chosen to stay here because he believes in us as much as we believe in him.
"For that, I want to publicly thank Chancellor Mark Emmert for staying the course and pushing us to do even better."
We can build LSU into a nationally competitive research university that will drive our economy.
"That goal must be at the forefront of all state economic policy, all state higher education policy, and a key part of every future administration’s agenda."
We have accomplished all these changes because we have invested.
We have invested our energy and we have invested our tax dollars on one thing: education.
I do not apologize for spending lots of tax dollars on education and I will not allow anyone to use any of you who have helped me as a punching bag on where our taxes have been spent.
"As we have invested, our students have performed."
"Last year, our 4th graders had the biggest improvement in math scores of all the states in the nation."
"Last year, our 8th graders made us one of only six states to see improvement in both math and reading scores."
"Despite our occasional disagreements, we have made major advances for our state."
"Now, as we enter this special session and the next regular session, we must answer some basic questions."
Do we adopt a standstill approach to our future?
Do we reward these successes in education with cuts in funding?
"Do we modernize the boat, or do we patch the boat, or do we abandon the boat and let it sink?"
"In other words, do we return to a state of failure?"
"You have to answer these questions for yourself, but my answer is very simple: As far as I’m concerned, THERE WILL BE NO RETREAT AND NO SURRENDER."
"This is why I have called you into Special Session, and this is why this Special Session is needed."
Many other states are facing severe cuts in services due to the economic downturn suffered by our nation after September 11th.
Louisiana is fortunate not to share their problems.
"Because we budgeted conservatively, acted quickly with a hiring freeze, managed well, and are recommending an elimination of almost 2200 positions in state government, we are in a position to do more than just plug holes in the boat without raising taxes."
"I do not intend to discuss every item in detail, but I will take a few moments to tell you what I believe must be done to keep us moving forward, to keep the momentum we have established, to keep making the changes we must make."
"Consider this for a moment: if Louisiana acquires the NBA Hornets, it sends a real message throughout our nation."
"In fact, the NBA officials who listened to our presentation in New Orleans last week have already received the message."
"Our presentation was about economic development in Louisiana – first in debt reduction, from 44th to 17th in how we manage our money, from 46th to 18th in the use of technology in government."
"It was about what we have accomplished in the last six years in economic development – the UNO/Naval Information Center, the growth of Chase Manhattan’s mortgage records facility in Monroe, the major expansion of Westlake’s chemical manufacturing plant in Lake Charles – and where we are headed in the next twenty years."
"We should want the Hornets, and we should want to keep the Saints."
They can and do make money for our state.
The Saints contributed over $130 million to the Louisiana economy in 2000.
Dr. Tim Ryan projects the Hornets will contribute over $100 million dollars.
"The Saints are responsible for just under 3,000 jobs and the Hornets will create as many as 1,200 jobs."
"These teams make us money and they create jobs.However, they do even more."
"The value of national television exposure resulting from these franchises cannot be quantified, but we know they bring millions in free advertising to New Orleans and Louisiana."
"A couple of weeks ago, I attended an economic development conference in Baton Rouge where a leading expert spoke.His message was very clear."
"When businesses locate, lifestyle choices are far more important than taxes in deciding where to locate."
He said continuing to improve our education system should be our highest priority—and it will be … and we must not retreat from the improvements we have made in our business climate.
"But, he also said that our unique culture and Louisiana quality of life were important assets."
"In short, “passing a good time” is also an economic development tool, and the Saints and the Hornets just add to this."
"However, professional sports development is only a small part of the effort to keep the momentum going in Louisiana."
We also must continue the expansion of the Convention Center in New Orleans by increasing the hotel/motel tax in the New Orleans area and by using other locally generated sources of revenue.
"This Convention Center is a magnet for shows, conventions and gatherings that result in hundreds of millions of new dollars entering the Louisiana economy."
"So we need to maintain New Orleans as a first-class entertainment venue – and professional sports teams are a part of this – but when business people come for a visit, we must also show them we are serious about business."
That is why our other proposals are so important.
"I will ask your assistance in helping to improve our Quality Jobs Act so that we can bring higher paying jobs with health care benefits to the people of Louisiana—this program works in all industries and will help us bring new jobs to urban and rural areas, from Shreveport and Monroe to Lake Charles and Houma."
"I will ask you to extend the tax credit program for automobile manufacturers so we can offer $5,000 per job tax credits instead of the usual $2,500 per job."
"General Motors in Shreveport is counting on this, and we need to do our part so they can do theirs—and build that new light truck manufacturing plant in Shreveport, Louisiana."
We need to expand the film and video incentives.
"Currently, our incentives are aimed at movies, but the real economic activity in this area is in commercials, videos, and television shows of a smaller variety."
"When our university professors create and patent their ideas, all too often the manufacturing, distribution, and sales of these products, where the jobs are created, are done in other states."
We must bring these jobs to Louisiana.
"After all, it was our imagination and money that made the jobs possible."
This is why I will ask you to pass a research and development tax credit and a commercialization tax credit.
"Finally, I will ask you to require our Department of Economic Development to produce a competitiveness and accountability report."
The purpose is simple: tell us how these programs are working and how well we compare to the competition.
"In short, I do not want Louisiana to go down the road of tax incentives without a progress report every step of the way."
"While all of this business development and tax incentive legislation is important, it pales in insignificance when we talk about our children, our grandchildren, and their education."
"As I have said, we have made enormous progress in education, but we have a long, hard trip left to finish."
"We are not where we need to be, and we are a long way from where I want us to be."
"EDUCATION IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHILE ILLITERACY MEANS POVERTY."
We must continue our fight against poverty by educating our children.
"This is why I will ask you to help me make technical changes to last year’s Pre-K bill so more districts can participate, to double the investment in Pre-K from $18 million to $38 million, and to create a Pre-K Trust Fund in which school districts may voluntarily invest their portion of the one-time windfall that resulted from the sale of the tobacco settlement last year."
I also need your help in creating a Rewards Fund so we can reward those schools that meet their accountability program goals.
"Finally, we will have an accountability program with both a carrot and a stick."
"Education is our beacon to economic expansion, especially in this world of technology, information, and bioscience."
I want to take a moment and talk about our commitment to bioscience as an economic development tool.
"Please understand: this is a long-term goal, not a short-term fix."
"If we show responsible leadership today, our children and grandchildren will reap the rewards of our steadfast commitment."
Bioscience leads our nation in economic expansion and jobs creation.
It is where investments are occurring in the private sector.
It provides us with an opportunity to combine our economic needs with our health care demands.
"With a little commitment on our part and a targeted strategy to invest in world-class researchers who can win federal grants, we can increase the advances we are already seeing."
Let me give you a few examples.
The Director of the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy has patented a technology that transfers adult stem cells into people with spinal cord injury.
This procedure has the potential to provide dramatic recovery to patients who have lost all hope for recovery.
"The Director of the Neuroscience Center of Excellence at the LSU Health Science Center is leading a team that will use a $9 million National Science Foundation grant and an $11 million Department of Defense grant to develop nano and micro technologies, which have the potential to peer inside cells to find signals that trigger strokes."
This person has also invented and patented a pain medication without side effects.
He hopes this will be the first drug marketed by the St. Charles Pharmaceutical Company of New Orleans.
We can also leverage private dollars to support these initiatives.
"In fact, because of their confidence in our researchers, Pfizer Corporation has already invested $5 million in a grant to the LSU Medical Center."
Bio-Tech Imaging (BTI) in Shreveport is about to start manufacturing diagnostic kits for AIDS and cancer.
"BTI estimates this effort will create 90 jobs with salaries averaging over $30,000."
"As the new diagnostic products are rolled out, BTI expects to expand production that may triple employment."
"Moreover, BTI is exploring other research and development opportunities with the LSU Health Science Center in Shreveport and various universities all over North Louisiana.These are just a few examples.If you ask, can we compete?"
"My answer is, we’re already competing."
Let us help ourselves to continue.
Bioscience is not an industry focused on a cure for one disease.
It is an industry that goes wherever the health care needs of people lead.
"The research and development possibilities are enormous, the investments are huge, and the return in technical, well- paying jobs is great."
"During the regular session I will ask you to make investments in education, research and wet lab incubators for bioscience start-ups."
In this session I am asking you to pass a biotechnology sales and use tax exemption to keep this momentum going.
"Our fight to bring new, good-paying jobs, new opportunities, and new initiatives to our state has many fronts."
"If we remain a cynical people, we will not meet the challenges of change."
Standing still will result in failure.
Being satisfied will quickly create dissatisfaction.
"Many of our brightest people, both college-educated and skilled in crafts, have not stood still."
For twenty years they have been slowly leaving Louisiana.They leave everyday.
They are personally doing what they feel they must do to meet the demands and challenges of this new world.
"We want them back home, and we do not want anymore to leave."
"However, the only way to make this happen is to continue to change Louisiana, to make it better, to make it stronger, to make it healthier, to make our people smarter and therefore richer, and to make our unique lifestyle even more attractive."
"I truly wish there was a quick fix, but there’s not."
"There’s just steady, certain, sure and planned progress."
"The progress we have made in changing Louisiana couldn’t have happened without a strong partnership between our administration and the Legislature.For that, I thank you."
But let me be clear: The era that Future Shock warned us about is upon us.
"Now, more than ever, the impact of our decisions will be magnified."
If we seize the moment and push forward – we can keep narrowing the gap between Louisiana and our neighbors.
But if we settle for the status quo – or worse – we will rapidly return to our lowly rankings of six years ago.
"The choice is clear and I have confidence that, once again, wise and courageous leaders both in these chambers and across our state will join with me yet again to move Louisiana ahead.God Bless America.God Bless Louisiana.Thank You."
