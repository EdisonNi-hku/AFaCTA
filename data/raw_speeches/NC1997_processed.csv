SENTENCES
"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, my fellow North Carolinians."
We meet today with a common purpose and a common resolve -- to put education first.
This commitment is far more important than party or politics.
It is a commitment that will determine our future.
Our challenge is to act on that commitment in this session -- starting today.
Nothing else we do will be as important.Nothing.
So I come here today to ask you to dedicate this legislative session to the cause of better public education.
I stand ready to work with you to make this the most important education session in North Carolina’s history.
Let’s join in that commitment today.
"**** Let me say first of all, that I have no patience with those who say our schools are broken and cannot be fixed.They are wrong."
"Even some in this chamber today, may not believe that North Carolina can have truly excellent schools.They are wrong."
Let us be clear on why the public schools exist.
They do not exist for elected officials.
They do not exist for ideologues.
They do not exist for parents or teachers or principals.They exist for our children.
To educate them and prepare them for a changing and competitive world.
And the schools are doing a better job than their critics admit.
"Last month, a national report ranked North Carolina’s schools among the top twelve in the nation."
"It gave us high marks for setting academic standards, assessing student performance and providing equitable resources."
"In short, North Carolina's schools are not 48th."
Let’s give our schools the credit they deserve!
But that report did offer a valid criticism.
"Too often, our zeal and our good intentions led us in too many different directions."
"Adopting too many reforms that confuse teachers and complicate the job of educating our children.This year, let's get focused."
Let's concentrate on the two things that are most important in our children's education.
"And let's stick with these two things, until the job is done."
"Here are the two things I challenge North Carolinians to do over the next four years: Number 1, put Smart Start fully in place in all one hundred counties."
"Number 2, raise education standards and raise teacher pay to at least the national average.Do these two things."
Stick with them for four years.
Make this commitment to our children's future.
"And you’ll see our schools and our children compete with anybody, anywhere."
**** Seated in the Gallery today with Mrs. Hunt and Dr. Jay Robinson are some of North Carolina’s teachers.
"Next to being a parent, they have the most important job in North Carolina."
Please join me in paying tribute to them and all our teachers.
Teachers have difficult and demanding jobs.
They work long hours every day.Grade papers at night.
Stay late for parent conferences.
And worry endlessly about our children.
"But do you know what the state pays a beginning public school teacher today?Just $21,330 dollars a year."
"And the top salary -- for the most experienced and most qualified teacher, who has taught for thirty years -- is less than $43,000.That is wrong!"
Is it any wonder 30 percent of our teachers leave in the first three years?
"Just last week, I got a letter from concerned parents at Root Elementary School here in Raleigh."
"One their favorite teachers, Kathleen Hagerty, has left to take a job at almost double her current salary."
She left because she did not earn enough to pay her living expenses and pay back the money she borrowed to get her masters' degree.
"The parents wrote: ""We are all extremely disappointed."
Her leaving is a great loss to our school.
North Carolina’s teachers deserve better.They deserve greater respect.
"They deserve greater support from parents, students and all of us.And they deserve better pay."
"So I am proposing that by the year 2000, we raise the starting salary for teachers to $25,000 dollars a year."
"And I am proposing that we raise the pay for our best and most experienced teachers to at least $53,000 dollars a year."
"If we do this, we will attract the best teachers, we will keep them in our classrooms, and we will take a giant step toward giving our children the education they deserve."
Let’s make this commitment and take this step forward this year.
Let me be clear about this -- I am not talking about simply raising pay across the board without regard to experience and qualification.
"First and foremost, I am talking about paying better teachers for better performance."
"Paying a bonus up to $1,000 dollars when their students learn more under the ABC plan."
A 12 percent bonus for earning national-board certification.
A 10 percent bonus for earning a masters' degree.
"I am talking about raising academic standards, holding students and schools accountable for their progress, and making sure students learn the basics and the skills they need to get a good job."
"I am talking about paying teachers more for extra work, like starting the school year early, mentoring new teachers and helping students who are behind."
I am talking about increasing starting salaries by nearly 20 percent so that we can attract more bright young people into the profession.
I am talking about making sure these new teachers are better trained and get a full year of experience in the classroom before they even start teaching.
"I am talking about extra pay raises in years when they pass tougher evaluations and meet higher standards -- such as when they first earn their license, earn their continuing license and earn tenure."
I am talking about making it harder to earn tenure and easier to get bad teachers out of the classroom.
Some people say bad teachers should not get a pay raise.I agree.They should get a pink slip.
What I am talking about is a pay raise for all teachers and higher pay raises for teachers who meet higher standards.
It’s the least we can do for the most important and hardest working people in our state.
Some people say we can’t afford this step forward.
But the cost of reaching the national average is just 2 percent of the total state budget over the next four years.2 percent.Surely we can afford that.
Surely we can afford to pay our teachers a decent wage.
A wage that shows we value all that they do.
That helps us attract and keep the best and brightest in the classroom.
Legislation to accomplish this goal will be introduced shortly in both the House and Senate.
"It will put into action our plan for excellent teaching -- as well as higher academic standards, workforce training and technology."
It will be called the Excellent Schools Act.
I urge you to pass it this year.
"I urge you to pass it, so we can recruit and retain the very best teachers for our children."
I urge you to pass it and enable our public schools to take this big step forward in these four years.
"**** Higher standards and better teachers, that’s number one."
Let’s talk now about the other big step we need to take.
It’s really the first step in the life of a child.
It's one where North Carolina is already leading the nation.
It's one that can have the greatest impact on our children and their future.It's Smart Start.
We're not just talking about budgets and programs here.
"We are literally talking about children's brains, and how quickly they develop and grow."
Time magazine last month devoted an entire issue to this subject.
Last week the nation's governors devoted much of their conference to it.
Democratic and Republican governors alike are focusing on it.
This is coming from new scientific research and discoveries.
Scientists have found that the brain grows faster and develops more fully when a child is held and talked to and hugged and loved.
They have found that eighty-five percent of the brain develops in the first three years.Eighty-five percent.
That’s why children with good parents get a good start.
That’s why good day care is so important.
That’s why children who are neglected and abused are hurt for life.
You all have heard me talk about little children’s brains for four years now.
You might be getting tired of it.
But now I’ve got science on my side.
"My wife's known it for a long time, and she just wants to know why its taken me forty years, four children and six grandchildren to figure it out."
"Now, we can't guarantee every child a good family."
And we can't set up a new public school system for children under 5.
What we can do in state government is be a catalyst for children.
What we can do is get state and local government working together.
Churches and businesses and community groups and health care providers working together.
Local communities working together to meet the needs of children -- in your community and mine.
What we can do is put more public and private resources into those critical early years.
And that’s what Smart Start does.
"In Mecklenburg County, Smart Start has helped child care centers double the number of children they serve."
"In Lenoir County, the partnership is helping children who are not ready for kindergarten."
"Teaching them basic thinking, language and physical skills."
Helping them catch up and enter school ready to learn.
"In Stanly County, Smart Start is helping parents become their child's first teacher."
And it provides a little extra money to help one parent stay at home during their child's first year.
This is what Smart Start is doing today in 43 counties.
And this is why we need it fully in place in all one hundred counties by the year 2000.
I ask you to make that commitment this year so our children will get the good start they all deserve.
**** Certainly we have many other responsibilities to meet in this session.
"We have a responsibility to see that our schools and our communities are safer from crime, drugs and violence."
We must continue to crack down on school discipline.
We must devise a more effective way of dealing with juvenile crime.
We must continue to lock up dangerous criminals and require them to work hard in prison.
And we should act on the recommendations of John Medlin’s Commission on the Future of the Courts -- to make sure that our courts are up to the challenge of the 21st Century.
"We have a responsibility to keep our universities and community colleges among the best in the nation, with competitive faculty and facilities."
We have a responsibility to keep North Carolina ahead of the nation in attracting new jobs and new businesses.
Last session you passed tax cuts and incentives that are working.
Now we need to train workers for new and expanding businesses.
"And we should expand JobReady, our school-to-work initiative, statewide."
We must demand personal and parental responsibility.
We must keep moving people from welfare to work and keep demanding that parents pay their child support.
"We must help our people find good, affordable health care."
We should help children get a healthy start.
And we should expand and improve in-home care for the elderly.
We must keep our roads safe from drunk drivers.
"Lieutenant Governor Wicker is giving strong leadership in this area that is saving lives, and I urge action on his recommendations."
We must keep teenagers from smoking.
Attorney General Easley is leading the fight to keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors and we should pass his initiative.
We must keep our environment clean.
Last year we set up the Clean Water Trust Fund.
We passed tougher animal waste regulations.
"This year we should go further, clean up our rivers, protect our drinking water and preserve our marine fisheries for commercial and recreational use."
"And I will get the Division of Marine Fisheries straightened out, starting immediately."
And we have a responsibility to pay for it without raising taxes.
We cut a billion dollars in taxes over the last four years.
We’ve saved taxpayers money and given them better value for their tax dollars.
We have shown what we can do when we put our state’s future ahead of narrow political interests.
**** Now we face an historic challenge.
"Last month, in my Inaugural Address, I called for a new commitment to public education.Today, I call for action."
It's going to take both branches of government and it's going to take both parties.
It's going to take all of us working together.
Last year both parties worked to pass the $1.8 billion school bond.
And voters passed it with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Last month Speaker Brubaker and Senator Basnight both spoke of the need to focus on education during this session.
(I’m proud to announce today that both have agreed to co-sponsor the Excellent Schools Act.
This is a remarkable and dramatic display of bipartisan leadership for the sake of our children.
**** We can meet this new challenge.
We can meet it as North Carolinians have met challenges before.
"As this Legislature did at the beginning of the 20th Century, when it created the public school system."
Back then we had only a few local schools scattered around the state.
Many were log cabins with dirt floors.
Only a third of school-aged children were attending school.
And some schools met only twenty days a year.
Governor Charles Brantley Aycock challenged the General Assembly to change that -- to give every child the opportunity to learn.
"Our state was poor, but the Legislature responded."
In one year the Legislature doubled its annual appropriation for public schools.
They started building eight hundred schoolhouses to make public education available across North Carolina.
That Legislature met the challenge nearly one hundred years ago.
Just as the Legislature did during the Depression.
"In those days, schools all over the country were closing."
Our Legislature took over most of the financial responsibility for education and kept North Carolina’s schools open.
"And the Legislature met the challenge in the early 1960’s, when it committed North Carolina not only to universal education, but also to quality education."
Now we have a new challenge for a new century.
A challenge to provide our children with an excellent education and a Smart Start.
"And in the next century, our successors and our grandchildren will measure what we did here by two questions."
Did we help children get a good start in life?
Did we give our children excellent teachers and excellent schools?
Only you in this Legislature can provide the answer.
Only you in this Legislature can make it happen.
"I look forward to joining with you as this Legislature meets the challenge, makes history and leads North Carolina into the 21st Century.Thank you.And God bless you."
