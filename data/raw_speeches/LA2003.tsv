HONORED GUESTS, MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE, CITIZENS OF LOUISIANA The first thing I’d like to say is that being Governor of a state like this is a great privilege, and I have to tell you that I have enjoyed it.
I’m honored by the fact that the people have let me do this.
But, the reason I wanted to start off by talking about this is because it would not have been possible; it would not have been any fun unless you all had been there with me and helped me to do it.
Some of you go back 15 years when I was in the Senate.
Some of you go back eight years.
Some of you go back four years, and some of you are new.
To those of you that are new, you will find a lot of satisfaction in public service.
For that I just want to say thank you very, very much.
Now, I think it’s only proper to start off by saying these are unusual times for our state and nation.
On the national level, our president and leaders have made extremely difficult choices fraught with many risks to ensure the security of the American people.
As I mentioned in a personal letter to my friend, our president, (I wrote him a letter right in the middle of all this stuff because he’s that kind of fellow -- I wanted to tell him something) and I said, “I appreciate your leadership.
It’s about doing those things that you determine to be right even when many disagree or do not understand.
It’s easy to do something when everyone agrees with you.
In my opinion, President Bush is that type of leader, and he has my full support, and I hope he has yours in his endeavors today.
On a smaller, but nonetheless important scale, we here in Louisiana must make difficult decisions based on priorities that are best for our state’s future.
Due to our enemy’s unprovoked and despicable attacks of Sept. 11, and because of a slowing economy that resulted, you and I have been put in the position of making very tough decisions regarding the future of our state.
You should feel no guilt for any of this.
Because we have been frugal, our problems are much less than our neighbors’, but they are still substantial.
Nobody should feel any guilt for the fact that we have some fiscal problems.
We didn’t cause it.
I’d like to remind you that when many of us assumed office together in 1996, (a lot of us have forgotten this) we faced extremely difficult times as our Medicaid program was going bankrupt.
And had we not fixed it, every program in state government would have been at risk.
When I took office, we had a $1 billion hole in Medicaid.
We fixed it.
We thought out of the box.
We stopped the corruption that was in it.
So, our problem today is not as bad as it was when we took office, and we’re going to have to think out of the box.
We’re going to have to do different things.
We’ve been in this position before and we prevailed by strategic thinking.
Despite enormous political pressure to do otherwise, we have held steady in the past seven years, and have prioritized education and economic development.
Investments in these two areas will move up our state.
You can do other things.
You can give everybody a little bit, but if you don’t fix these things, we’ll never move ahead.
At the same time, we have invested $1.5 billion new dollars in health care - an amount equal to what we put in education.
Those new dollars funded increases to all the major providers - hospitals, nursing homes, and physicians - and helped us provide health insurance for thousands of our children.
As a result of our strategic and steadfast investments in better education, health care and economic development, we have improved the lives of our families for generations to come.
Now, as we budget for the future of Louisiana-which is going to be the toughest thing in this Session- I ask you to be courageous once again.
Just as I have built this budget around education and economic development during my entire two terms as Governor, this year is absolutely no different.
We must fund health care adequately, but we’ll have to invest our money smarter than we have in the past.
We’re going to have to think out of the box.
We did it seven years ago.
We can do it again.
If we are serious about changing Louisiana for the better, we must sustain the reforms we have enacted and continue our strategic investments.
For too many years our public schools, community colleges, and universities suffered budget cut after budget cut because they did not have the high-powered lobbyists and vocal constituencies that other competing interests have.
You know that.
Nobody comes and begs you to vote for the colleges.
Nobody comes and begs you to vote for the new community college system we have.
You’ve just got to decide that that’s the right thing to do.
Frankly, we are at the crossroads in the history of Louisiana.
We literally cannot afford to take the easy way by spreading the budget problems in non-strategic ways just to try and fix things for the short term.
The short term is just that --- SHORT TERM.
It is temporary.
It does not last.
And to paraphrase the Good Book, these are hard times and stormy seas that we find ourselves in.
But, this will surely pass.
We must hold strong to our faith in a better state, steady our resolve and continue to look for more efficient ways of delivering services so we can have healthier, better educated and more employable people.
We must not allow our tremendously successful reforms to be swallowed up by an undercurrent of shortsightedness and reactionary politics as usual.
Continued investments in education and economic development, particularly, will continue to bring our citizens into the mainstream of full productivity, participation in the future of our great state and actually ban taxes.
Now, before we can take a look at the future, let’s just take a quick look at where we’ve been.
You have helped me - and this is what I appreciate: Run Government Like a Business We have reduced state debt by almost $1 billion dollars and lead the nation in debt reduction.
We were a debtor state.
We’re not anymore.
That’s not a problem.
We’ve got it under control.
That’s big.
We’ve invested $2.3 billion in trust funds, contrary to those who say we’ve spent every nickel we could get our hands on.
That’s a lot of money in trust that wasn’t there before.
You all could have spent it.
Other states spent it.
Other states spent their tobacco money.
Other states have spent all their trust fund money.
We haven’t done that.
Whether you believe it or not, it’s the truth.
In the past seven years, net taxes have been reduced.
You never hear that.
Net taxes in this state have been reduced.
This is one I really want to commend you on.
We’ve passed tax reform measures that took considerable political courage, in spite of the fact that people had said we should have been doing it.
Every reform group said we should do it.
It was hard to do.
You had the political courage.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legislature that I’ve felt as good about as when we did that tax reform last year.
A lot of you knew you were going to be criticized.
A lot of you came to me and said this may cost me my job, but I’m tired of seeing the same old system that makes us come over here and waste time.
It was a very, very courageous move.
It was one of your finest hours.
Really, I never felt better about the legislature.
Here’s one you don’t hear very often: Remember the SECURE recommendations?
During the last seven years, we’ve done 70% of them.
If you don’t believe me, look at LABI President Dan Juneau’s statement referencing their consultant’s (KPMG), 2002 annual report: “Actions taken by state government to implement the SECURE recommendations have generated approximately $2.1 billion dollars which have been used to reduce state debt, solve problems with Medicaid funding, and increase funding for education.
This is because we did what was said we ought to do in the SECURE recommendations.
Here’s another one that if you listen to people, you’d never believe, but it’s true: We’ve cut state employee growth.
There are only two departments that have more people now than seven years ago.
One is corrections and one is higher ed.
Why is that?
We still haven’t educated our people out of the hole where they can all get jobs, so they end up in the prison system.
And why is the higher ed budget up?
We started the community college system.
There was none.
We started that community college system and it has increased.
It is the best one in the country as far as the way it is increasing right now.
The community college system is unbelievable.
I have person after person come to me and say, “if you’ll train 1,000 people, we’ll put them to work at $40,000 a year.
We moved from 44th to 18th best in utilization of government technology to provide services to our citizens (Center for Digital Government).
Likewise, we went from 44th to 18th best in money management among states (Governing Magazine, Maxwell School, Syracuse, NY) You may have noticed that I had an updated list of positive achievements placed on your desk.
You really ought to have this when you run for office.
It’s not what you or I say about us; it’s what others say about us.
Before I go any farther, I’d like to point out something that I’m proud to tell you.
I’m trying to say that we’ve managed our money right.
The National Governor’s Association, last year, named Mark Drennen “Top Fiscal Manager in the U. S. This was no small accomplishment and we salute you, Mark, for a job well done.
That’s what the feds said about us.
That’s what our governors said about us.
We have run this state like a business.
Because we succeeded in managing taxpayers’ dollars wisely, with your help, we have been able to keep our word to the citizens of Louisiana by.
Investing in Education as a Priority $1.5 billion more went toward education - $900 million was added to K-12 - $500 million went to colleges; before you celebrate, we still fund our colleges close to last in the South - We reversed the horrible trend of 13 budget cuts in nine years that literally drove our faculty out of the state - $100 million was set-aside for TOPS -- this was probably the best tax break any citizen could have gotten -- TOPS.
This is a great program where any youngster can make an average grade score and go to college.
When I was in the Senate, we used to talk about it like it would never happen.
We funded the minimum foundation for the first time.
We’d never done it.
When I was in the Senate we’d talk about it like it was something that might happen.
It happened.
We’ve continually funded it since then.
We have taken $92 million from cash surpluses to invest in K-12 technology.
Prior to this, we ranked only ahead of Guam.
We were next to last in what we did in putting technology in the classroom.
We took $100 million from cash surpluses and put it into higher education deferred maintenance.
I see a few gubernatorial candidates around the room.
When I was running, I kept hearing that and couldn’t believe it.
I went to the campuses.
I have to tell you, before 1996, they must not have ever put money into colleges - roofs were falling in, doors were falling off.
We had put no money into our college maintenance.
So we’ve done the right thing.
We’ve prioritized.
These investments in education are getting results.
Our accountability program is among the best in U. S. 93% of our schools have shown improvement.
We were one of five states to improve in both math and reading scores among 8th graders on a NATIONAL test.
Our 4th graders were the most improved in the nation on the NAEP test in math - Louisiana students LED THE NATION.
Our early childhood program is among the best in U. S. -- these children will do better in school, be less dependent on welfare, have fewer teen births, and earn higher salaries - all because we are investing in Pre - K. There is absolutely NO BETTER WAY to end the cycle of poverty than Pre - K. We have 6,000 children enrolled and we intend to ask you to help us fund an increase so we can add more to our rolls.
If you doubt me, find Richard Stalder.
You all know Richard.
He runs Corrections.
He’s been recognized by his groups as being the top corrections officer in the country last year, and he runs one of the three accredited systems in the country.
Richard has on several occasions said to me, ”Everywhere I see a poor state that doesn’t incarcerate a lot of people, they have Pre-K.
I saw it.
I adopted a class years ago, before they gave any money.
Those youngsters that come from homes where the mother works two jobs, or is a teenager, is not going to have a chance.
Get them in there early.
In two or three years, they’d be right with their class.
It is probably the most important thing that we can do.
I hope you will help us increase it.
I’ve heard people say, “Well, we don’t know where we’ll get the money-next year.
Every year counts.
Speaking of children, more than 577,000 who were previously uninsured now have health insurance because of Medicaid and LaCHIP.
I believe our efforts in early childhood education, health care for children, and welfare reform will significantly raise the independence and productivity of our children.
Another achievement in education that you should be proud of is the fact that we have raised teacher pay considerably.
It’s been one of my biggest disappointments (not getting teacher pay to the SREB average).
I didn’t take my salary.
I was very unwise and said I wouldn’t take it unless we got to the Southern average.
But, we didn’t get there.
But, let me tell you what I have done: We’ve raised teacher pay 36%.
- $9,500 is the average salary increase - We are #2 in the South in percent increase in teacher pay - We are #3 in the South in actual dollar increase - Five separate raises have been given to our teachers and another is proposed in my upcoming budget.
We’re probably one of only a few states, if any, who are trying to do this.
Because of our investments in technology, almost every single school in the state today has access to the Internet.
Our student-to-computer ratio has gone from 88:1 to nearly 7:1.
It’s important that we keep pushing this if we are to have a generation of young people able to compete in the 21st century economy.
Post-Secondary Education - We have restructured higher education, giving the Board of Regents more policy and funding authority.
I can remember when we talked about that for years in the legislature.
Nobody could figure out how to do it.
But, we got together, and we did this.
Now, we have a central board that has the authority to save us money because that’s what they do.
By coordinating, you save money.
- We have created a community and technical college system, which is the fasted growing in U. S. I can’t tell you the faith I have in that system to put people to work.
- We have moved from 43rd to 6th highest in increased funding for higher education.
Before you celebrate, we’re almost last in the South.
- We have dramatically increased the number of endowed professorships and chairs All of this has resulted in impressive statistics: our graduation rates are up; remediation rates are down.
I remember a few years ago when it was very common to have a 30% remediation rate in the colleges.
I can remember when people said you’re crazy for saying we ought to have entrance requirements in colleges.
That’s better than sending a lot of people there and spending all of your time remediating.
more degrees are being awarded; enrollment in four-year universities is up 9%, enrollment in community colleges is up 30%.
Once again, I applaud you for joining me in making these investments and reforms.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Together, we’ve focused on what’s best for Louisiana in the economic development realm.
Like I always say, “If you don’t know where you’re going, then you sure as heck can’t get there.
We are .
Training Louisiana’s Workforce & Creating Good Jobs We’ve got something called Vision 2020.
It’s a blueprint.
It says, “Here is what we need to do in Louisiana to be competitive.
We just upgraded that this year.
We have a group that’s worked very hard on that, and it changes all the time, trying to keep up with where we are.
I want to mention something again.
We did civil law reform to create a better business climate.
Some of the things I saw before that reform would have kept any business from wanting to open in this state.
I have seen the old law allow billion-dollar settlements where there was $50,000 worth of damage.
I’ve seen $2.5 billion settlements where nobody was actually hurt permanently or killed.
We changed that.
If we hadn’t changed that, nobody was coming to this state.
We’ve reorganized the Department of Economic Development into clusters.
Let me tell you something.
You voted on it twice.
That department works.
If you don’t believe me, talk to anybody that goes to that department.
They’ll tell you how well they’re treated, how they work with them.
I have not had a single company that wants to come here or stay here that hasn’t given me praise for that company.
We’ve placed the focus on biotech and biomedical technologies.
We’ve established the Incumbent Worker training program, a $6 million to $50 million fund growth.
We’ve done this in conjunction with LABI.
That didn’t cost our taxpayers anything.
We have the best fund in the country.
When a company wants to stay here and train employees, we can do it, through the Department of Labor.
When a company wants to come here or stay here, we can do that.
That’s big.
We got that out of our unemployment funds.
Like I say, without the cooperation of LABI, we couldn’t have done that.
We’ve got something that you need to know about, because it’s out there.
It’s something the department’s done.
It’s called a Work Ready Certificate.
I have always thought we should have a two-track system.
What do you do with somebody that doesn’t get a degree, that doesn’t want to go to college?
Well, these Work Ready Certificates were the idea of the Workforce Commission.
They give a national test.
If a person passes it - there are 2 levels – they can take it to an employer.
Right off the bat the employer will know that the person knows enough math and reading to be a decent employee.
There was a group of employers about 2 weeks ago who told me yes, they were doing this.
We created more than $1.2 billion in investments since March 2002.
You may not be able to do economic development in a duck blind, but these people did it right.
You may want to take a look at the Economic Development brochure I asked to be placed on your desk.
This will tell you the successes of that department.
INFRASTRUCTURE Our Department of Transportation, with 378 fewer employees, has averaged over $173 million dollars more in contract lettings than in previous administrations.
This is a 61% increase in productivity.
In the year prior to our administration, 315 miles of overlay were completed.
Our eight-year average is now 502 miles per year.
We were able to do this, in part, because we used $55 million from cash surpluses.
With your help, we renewed the TIMED program.
This was another fine moment for our legislature.
The TIMED program was three years from going off the books.
It takes at least three years to design big highways.
Had we let it run out, we would have had a big fight over the priorities again.
Secondly, we probably wouldn’t have passed it.
Thirdly, we would have never four-laned this state.
But, you had the forethought and were wise enough to do it.
We’re going to four-lane this state probably in the next 10 years.
I was proud of it.
You be proud of it.
Tell your constituents that we will four-lane this state.
DOTD recently adopted a master plan for Louisiana infrastructure that outlines the design and construction for major transportation projects over the next 30 years.
We have taken steps to continue looking to secure private funding for a large intermodal airport.
The last thing I want to say about transportation is this: it’s a bit of a reality check.
I would tell you this if I were running again, but I’m not.
You’ve got a problem.
You’re going to have one of two things happen with your constituents.
Either they’re going to drive you nuts because the roads are not keeping up or you can find enough revenue to make us competitive with Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas and they would gripe that they were paying about $6 more a month.
Every time that’s polled, it looks bad.
But, I asked in my program, said will pay $6 more a month for better roads and 70% said yes.
I said, “Do you want to pay more taxes?” People said no.
The point is we under fund (compared to) all of our neighbors.
We’ve had 20 cents on the books, four cents which is in TIMED for twenty years or thereabouts and that penny has depreciated.
The cost of roads has doubled.
In the last six months, the cost of asphalt and concrete has doubled because of gas prices.
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know you’re not going to have the roads.
The sooner you tell your constituents (the better); and you don’t have to tell them until after the election, but after the elections tell them the truth.
Coastal Restoration Now one more thing, I have to talk about it.
When we came into office one of the things we recognized was that the size of the program we had wasn’t the size of the problem.
I have to tell you that I didn’t even understand and I’ve spent all my life out there (outdoors and in coastal areas).
I had a capsule and I knew what happened in lower St. Mary parish.
I’d sometimes go a little farther over west and I knew what had happened over there, but I didn’t have a feel for what the coast was like until I got into this job.
We’ve got a major, major problem with the coast.
The United States has a major problem.
If we don’t so something about this coast it’s going to be like the Governor of Arkansas said, he’s going to be the Governor of Louisiana and the coast and it’s going be out there.
It’s a serious, serious problem with a short fuse.
In 10 years it’s going to be serious.
In five years it’s going to be serious.
It developed over fifty years.
When we levied the river it started.
And in 50 years, believe me, we could easily loose our whole estuary which provides 30 to 35 percent of the country’s seafood and that could be gone.
The whole oil and gas industry could go up in smoke.
This is not a north Louisiana or a south Louisiana issue because when the roads start going and the towns start going everybody’s going to have to pay.
The Port of Fourchon is connected by narrow little roads.
We are, I think, going to experiment out there and try our first toll roads in the state.
So what have we done?
We’ve sponsored a 2001 Coastal Summit in which I think maybe 800 to 1,000 people came and surprised me they were all interested.
And then this led to the creation of the commission for the future coast of Louisiana.
It brought together 14 individuals from businesses and diverse backgrounds and they drew up a plan to implement a unified program in order to tackle it.
This was the case of the business community getting involved.
How many times have I told you, you get the business community enthused about something in this state to work with us and the administration and the legislature, you can get things done.
And we begin to move.
We now have Governor’s Advisory Commission on Coastal Restoration and Conservation.
Within the last month, I’ve been to Washington and I sponsored a meeting with John Breaux and other members of the congressional delegation.
And what we did there with every department and entity we said, “Guys, you have to save the Everglades, you have to save the Chesapeake Bay, but we’ve got a working coast that supports this country.
And if you don’t do it, it’s not going to be good for the United States of America.
So anyway, I have a passion about it.
I’ve put a book on your desk.
I asked the author to be here today.
It tells the story well.
It’s the second book that I’ve seen on the coast.
It’s written by a fellow by the name of Mike Tidwell.
Mike where are you?
Good man.
His (news)paper told him to come to Louisiana and write about Louisiana.
And he said, “Well I’m going to hitch hike down boats on the bayou.
And as he did it, all of a sudden he met a whole new culture, and he met a big problem.
He took three years to write about it.
I’m going to do the closing (of the speech), but real quick, I want to run through a few things that I think are important in this session.
We want to renew the Incumbent Worker Training Fund.
It’s not complicated and we need it and it works.
We need to look at the possibility to authorize some big sites and get options if we have a big company come here.
We can say, “If you want to build a big auto plant, we can tell you where the land is and what you can buy it for.
In education lets talk about some things that are going to cause a little stir.
I can’t imagine how you or I can leave this session and say we don’t have a plan for failing schools.
And we’re going to leave young people in failing schools.
I don’t see how we’re going to do that.
Now, we’ve got an accountability program, and we know which schools are not doing well.
We mean a school that has failed and then we’ve gone in and helped them and then they have failed again.
Our conscience is not going to be clear.
Vouchers are one way out of that.
I see nothing sinful about saying you can go to the closest school, maybe it’s a public school, but you can go to the closest good school.
That’s one suggestion.
Another suggestion is that you can let the state take over these for a limited period of time.
They did it in Chicago and it worked.
If you’ve got a better idea, have at it.
I think we will have committed a sin if we leave here and we leave youngsters in failing schools where they cannot get out.
We have a school discipline package and it’s not a huge thing, but talk to teachers.
Discipline is a problem, and we can’t paddle students anymore and I don’t know why but you can’t.
And it’s hard to maintain.
It’s not only that, we have whole group of young people that didn’t have training at home and maybe if we have our preschool we can fix that.
So we’re saying let’s take everything that’s in our law on discipline and put it in one package.
Let’s look at other states and see if we can come up with anything.
I would hope that you would help me put another $5 million into the community colleges.
That’s making us money; believe me, that’s making us money.
I hope you will support the teacher pay raise.
Everybody continues to say, “Let’s put more of the money into the classroom.
This is the opportunity.
I hope you will help me expand the pre K program – it’s very, very important.
And in the environment we have the opportunity to establish a Coastal Restoration Fund.
What we’re suggesting is that we take the money that has been going into the excess revenue from mineral settlements and putting it into a fund to match federal funds in the future.
If we had done it 10 years ago we would have had $200 million.
It won’t cost the taxpayers anything.
The two areas that I contend - again for you gubernatorial candidates that are here - there are two areas where we don’t have the money.
I think we can run government if we tighten it up.
If we don’t have enough money for the coast you don’t have enough money for the highways.
This will begin to establish a way to fund this with matching funds.
There are several other bills out there that are very serious.
Please look at the DEQ taskforce recommendations.
How tired are you of hearing how bad people feel about DEQ?
They work hard, but God bless them, we funded them last in the country and it’s tough.
You get what you pay for, unfortunately.
They’re good people, they’ve worked hard, but I got tired of hearing about it.
Every time I heard about something I investigated it and nothing really scared me, but I realized that we have to have a different approach.
I put a task force together it was environmentalists, people in business; they sat down and they’ve come up with a recommendation and some of it is going to cost a little money.
Let me tell you what’s going to happen if you don’t pay attention to it.
Don’t gnash your teeth if the federal government comes in and takes over some of that stuff.
If you want that, ignore this task force commission recommendation.
It’s a good recommendation.
The environmentalists support it, and business supports it.
If you support it, it will get done.
And you won’t have to read about DEQ all the time.
One other thing - you’re going to have to face up to the taxpayers of this state getting hooked with excessive damage settlements.
I don’t know the answer but I can tell you it’s a problem.
It over a billion dollar problem, it’s almost a two billion dollar problem.
We have people two and a half times the legal limit, drunk, sticking the state for huge sums.
We have groups of oyster fisherman who knew there was going to be a diversion project and had signed a waiver saying, “I realize that is happening.
We’ve got a $200 million judgment against the state.
We’ve got a highway that the feds think is ok but somehow the courts don’t think it’s ok. We’ve got another $100 or $200 million (in judgments).
You’re not going to be able to run this state unless you figure out how to fix this.
I’m glad this is something that I don’t have to deal with.
We’ve got some bills that will at least stop some of the bigger abuses.
If you’ve got any better ideas I would love to hear them.
Ok, that’s about it.
I think I can close here now.
Again, I want to tell you this is the best job in the world and you are my friends and colleagues.
But something I do want to say.
I want to give special thanks to General Bennett Landreneau and the Louisiana National Guard and to Colonel Terry Landry and the Louisiana State Police and the Department of Public Safety (Governor asks them to stand and be recognized).
I truly believe they are the best in the country and you should feel safe.
I’m serious about that and I am very comfortable about that.
I also want to thank my staff and the cabinet secretaries and I would ask them all to stand up.
These are the guys that work with me and they’ve made me proud.
Thank you.
And finally, I want to thank our First Lady, who stood by me throughout all this these eight years while at the same time making her own mark in history.
Alice has made the Governor’s Mansion a gracious place for all to enjoy.
The doors are open each year to thousands people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the globe.
It stands ready for the next administration to occupy and enjoy.
There are many other projects that she has been involved in and I know she wished to convey her deep appreciation to all of those who have volunteered their time and efforts.
Alice, stand up (applause) thank you.
Believe it or not there are 5,000 people a month that go through there (the Governor’s Mansion).
In closing, I want everyone to know it has been an honor and a privilege to work with you and serve the people of this exotic and diverse state.
There is no place like it on the earth and I think that when my days are over, I’ll find heaven to be no different than Louisiana, maybe just a little bit cooler in the summertime.
May God bless this great state, may God bless the United States of America, and may God bless and protect our troops.
Thank you.
