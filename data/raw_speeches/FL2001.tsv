GOOD MORNING.
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE, HONORED GUESTS, AND MY FELLOW FLORIDIANS.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL.
LET ME BEGIN BY SALUTING THE NEW LEGISLATORS WHO JOIN US TODAY.
FOR MANY IN THIS ROOM, THIS IS A DAY OF LONG-AWAITED FULFILLMENT.
YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.
IN SOME WAYS YOUR JOURNEY ENDS TODAY.
IN OTHERS, IT IS JUST BEGINNING.
DESPITE YOUR JUSTIFIABLE PRIDE, PERSONAL SATISFACTION SHOULDN’T BLIND YOU TO YOUR GREATER PURPOSE HERE.
YOU SHOULD PAUSE TO CONSIDER THE EVENTS THAT PROPELLED YOU INTO PUBLIC SERVICE.
EIGHT YEARS AGO, THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA TOOK TO THE POLLS AND CHANGED OUR CONSTITUTION.
TIRED OF THE PARALYSIS IN GOVERNMENT, SICKENED BY THE WAY SPECIAL INTERESTS HAD INCULCATED THEMSELVES INTO THE MACHINERY OF STATE, WE SAID THIS: NO POLITICIAN SHOULD SPEND MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE.
AND IN SO DOING, FLORIDIANS MADE ROOM FOR THE NEW LEGISLATORS HERE TODAY.
YOU SHOULD DEEPLY CONSIDER AND RESPECT WHAT FLORIDIANS WERE SAYING BY MAKING THIS CHOICE.
WE WERE SAYING THAT NEW IDEAS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXPERIENCE.
WE WERE SAYING THAT THE COURAGE TO ACT ON THEM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PERKS OF ENTRENCHED PUBLIC SERVICE.
AND WE WERE SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT IT IS THE PEOPLE, AND NOT THE PROCESS, WHOM YOU SERVE.
THIS CLASS OF FRESHMEN LEGISLATORS IS THE FIRST TO CARRY FORWARD THAT CHARGE.
THIS YEAR, WE HAVE 62 NEW LEGISLATORS -- WELL MORE THAN A THIRD OF THIS BODY.
IN TWO YEARS, EVERY SINGLE LEGISLATOR WILL STAND FOR RE-ELECTION.
EACH OF YOU HERE TODAY, FRESHMAN AND EXPERIENCED LEGISLATOR ALIKE, IS CALLED UPON TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A FUTURE THAT IS RUSHING TO MEET US.
AS I SAID, THIS IS A DAY OF FULFILLMENT -- AND IN THAT SENSE AN ENDING -- BUT IT IS ALSO A DAY OF NEW BEGINNINGS.
FOR TODAY YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE POWER TO CHANGE THE FACE OF FLORIDA…AND EVEN THE NATION.
I BELIEVE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE CAN ENACT REFORMS THAT WILL SERVE FLORIDIANS FOR GENERATIONS.
WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS IF WE SET AMBITIOUS GOALS AND PURSUE THEM WITH CLEAR POLICIES AND SINGLE-MINDED DETERMINATION.
MANY PEOPLE WILL COME TO YOU, OUR FRESHMEN LEGISLATORS, LIKE THEY DID TO ME, AND TELL YOU TO SLOW DOWN, TO KILL SOME TIME, AND LEARN THE SYSTEM.
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS: IF YOU TAKE TOO LONG, TIME AND THE SYSTEM WILL KILL YOUR ABILITY TO CAUSE MEANINGFUL CHANGE.
PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT TWO YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER.
BUT I KNOW, AND MANY OF THE RETURNING LEGISLATORS IN THIS CHAMBER KNOW WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN TWO SHORT YEARS.
A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO I STOOD A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM HERE UNDER THOSE BEAUTIFUL OAKS NEAR THE OLD CAPITOL.
I RAISED MY HAND AND TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE.
THAT DAY, I SAID WE NEEDED TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE VIEW PUBLIC EDUCATION, ELEVATING CHILDREN ABOVE BUREAUCRACIES.
I SAID WE NEEDED TO BE RELENTLESS IN OUR DRIVE TO STOP VIOLENT CRIME AND REDUCE DRUG ABUSE.
I SAID WE NEEDED TO CUT TAXES AND GIVE BACK TO FLORIDIANS WHAT IS JUSTIFIABLY THEIRS.
I SAID WE NEEDED TO BUILD A WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS CLIMATE TO BRING TO OUR STATE THE HIGH-WAGE JOBS OF TOMORROW.
I SAID WE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE FLORIDIANS -- THE CHILDREN, THE FRAIL ELDERS, AND THE DISABLED.
AND I SAID WE NEEDED TO BRING OPPORTUNITY TO OUR CITIES, WHILE PROTECTING WHAT IS BEST ABOUT FLORIDA’S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF SETTING THESE GOALS AND WORKING WITH A VISIONARY LEGISLATURE?
BECAUSE OF THE A+ PLAN, FLORIDA LEADS THE NATION IN INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION.
TWO YEARS AGO, THERE WERE 78 F SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE.
LAST YEAR THERE WERE ONLY FOUR.
AND THIS, TOO, IS ASTONISHING.
LAST YEAR, MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF FLORIDA’S SCHOOLS WERE A SCHOOLS OR IMPROVED AT LEAST ONE LETTER GRADE.
THESE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS HAVE EARNED OUR THANKS AND ADMIRATION.
GRADES AND TEST SCORES CONTINUE TO CLIMB -- PARTICULARLY AMONG MINORITIES -- AS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS REAP THE BENEFITS OF A SYSTEM THAT MEASURES AND REWARDS POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, A HARVARD STUDY CONCLUDED THAT FLORIDA’S SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABLE EDUCATION IS WORKING -- AND WORKING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL.
WHILE WE SHOULD TAKE HEART IN THE STATISTICS THAT SHOW THIS SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGE, WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE REAL CHANGE IS OCCURRING ON A HUMAN SCALE, STUDENT BY STUDENT.
IS THERE ANY GREATER REWARD TO GIVE A CHILD THAN THE TOOLS TO PROSPER, IN SOME CASES TO SALVAGE GIFTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST?
THERE SIMPLY IS NOT.
AND LET’S LOOK AT HOW WE’VE PROTECTED FLORIDIANS FROM VIOLENT CRIME.
MANY LEGISLATORS IN THIS ROOM WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN PUTTING INTO PLACE THE 10-20-LIFE PROGRAM, A LAW THAT IMPOSED CLEAR PENALTIES FOR THE USE OF A FIREARM IN A CRIME.
AS A RESULT, GUN CRIMES DROPPED AN ASTONISHING TWENTY PERCENT IN THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING THE LAW’S ENACTMENT.
IN 1999, FLORIDA EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST DROP IN CRIME SINCE 1971.
WITH THE HELP OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE ARE REVERSING A TREND THAT RAVAGED FLORIDA FOR DECADES.
LET US THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE.
AND LET US REWARD, NOT PUNISH, FLORIDIANS FOR THEIR THRIFT AND SUCCESS.
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE TAX CUTS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN $1.5 BILLION, ALLOWING A BROAD SEGMENT OF OUR CITIZENRY TO KEEP MORE OF WHAT THEY EARN AND TO SPEND IT THE WAY THEY CHOOSE.
650,000 TAXPAYERS ENJOYED INTANGIBLES TAX RELIEF, AND 3.7 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS [OR 9.2 MILLION PEOPLE] SAW PROPERTY TAX RELIEF.
THE BURDEN OF STATE TAXES WILL BE REDUCED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN A DECADE.
BY SHOWING FISCAL RESTRAINT AND ADVANCING REGULATORY REFORM, WE HAVE ALSO HELPED CREATE A CLIMATE WHERE BUSINESSES CAN PROSPER.
CONSIDER THESE EXTRAORDINARY FACTS: FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 2000, ONE IN NINE NEW JOBS AND ONE IN 12 NEW BUSINESSES IN THE NATION WERE CREATED IN FLORIDA.
THROUGH THEIR EFFORTS AND CREATIVITY, FLORIDIANS ARE BUILDING A MAGNIFICENT ECONOMIC ENGINE IN THIS NEW CENTURY.
WITH LITTLE FANFARE, WE HAVE ELEVATED TO THE TOP OF OUR PRIORITY LIST THE INTERESTS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND NEEDY.
BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, 84% OF THE 1.5 MILLION ELIGIBLE CHILDREN IN FLORIDA WILL HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, COMPARED TO 55% TWO YEARS AGO.
IN TWO YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BY $313 MILLION OR 77%.
AND WITH OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT NEXT YEAR, 28,000 FLORIDIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WILL HAVE RECEIVED VITAL SERVICES AFTER THEY LANGUISHED ON WAITING LISTS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.
WE ARE ALSO BALANCING INDUSTRY WITH STEWARDSHIP, WITH OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT FLORIDA’S FRAGILE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.
WITH THE RECENT ENACTMENT OF THE FLORIDA FOREVER PROGRAM, WE HAVE CONTINUED A LEGACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THAT IS THE BEST IN THE NATION.
AFTER DECADES OF IN-FIGHTING AND IMPASSES, IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE ALSO PUT IN PLACE A PLAN FOR RESTORING THE EVERGLADES, OUR GREATEST NATURAL TREASURE.
INDEED, RESTORATION OF THE EVERGLADES AND OTHER PROJECTS LIKE IT AROUND THE STATE WILL ALSO HELP KEEP MORE FRESH WATER IN OUR ECOSYSTEM, MAKING THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.
THESE ARE BUT SOME OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PAST TWO YEARS.
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS TOO MANY TO MENTION HERE TODAY.
BUT TAKEN IN WHOLE, AND BEARING IN MIND THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR STATE ULTIMATELY RISES OR FALLS WITH THE WILL AND WORK OF ITS PEOPLE, I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE STATE OF OUR BELOVED STATE IS GOOD.
INDEED, IT IS VERY GOOD.
IT IS VERY GOOD TODAY, AND WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR OUR BLESSINGS.
BUT WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?
LOOK OVER THE HORIZON: WHAT WILL FLORIDA LOOK LIKE?
WILL WE HAVE SCHOOLS WHERE THE COMMAND FOCUS IS ON CHILDREN LEARNING?
WILL WE HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS TO SHOW OUR CHILDREN THE WAY?
WILL WE HAVE WELL-PLANNED, VIBRANT COMMUNITIES WITH A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND IDENTITY?
WILL WE HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO MEET OUR NEEDS?
WILL WE HAVE PREPARED OUR ECONOMY FOR THE NEXT BURST OF PROSPERITY?
WILL STATE GOVERNMENT BE AN INSTITUTION THAT HARNESSES TECHNOLOGY, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT IS KNOWN FOR ITS PASSIONATE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE?
THESE QUESTIONS -- AND DOZENS OF MORE LIKE THEM -- ARE BASIC QUESTIONS, BUT QUESTIONS THAT ARE TOO OFTEN IGNORED OR RELEGATED TO ONE MORE TASK FORCE, ONE MORE STUDY COMMISSION.
BUT IF WE IGNORE THEM NOW, WE DO SO AT OUR PERIL.
WE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, AND WE MUST.
WE MUST HAVE THE COMMITMENT AND COURAGE AND THE GENUINE DESIRE TO REACH ACROSS THE POLITICAL DIVIDE AND WORK FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT.
IT IS TIME -- NO, IT IS PAST TIME -- TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND SHARE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS ONE, AS A GROUP COMMITTED TO THE HIGHER PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC SERVICE.
THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE FOR ALL OF US: WOULD WE RATHER BE KNOWN FOR THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGES WE CONQUERED OR FOR THE PETTINESS OF PARTISAN BICKERING?
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO EACH OF YOU IN THIS ROOM TO STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT THAT WILL BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.
AND AS WE WORK TOGETHER, I HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT LASTS, WHAT ENDURES BEYOND OUR BRIEF TIME IN THIS BUILDING.
ALTHOUGH YOU WILL CONSIDER MANY LAWS THIS YEAR, THE ONE I HOPE YOU MOST CONSIDER IS TAKEN FROM THE GREAT LAW OF THE IROQUOIS NATION: “IN OUR EVERY DELIBERATION, WE MUST CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR DECISIONS ON THE NEXT SEVEN GENERATIONS.
AND WITH THIS IN MIND, LET US BEGIN WHERE THE FUTURE IS FORMED: LET US BEGIN WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
THIS YEAR, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES OF THE A+ PLAN.
AS YOU KNOW, ONE KEY COMPONENT OF THE PLAN IS TO TEST CHILDREN SO WE CAN BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED A YEAR’S WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN A YEAR’S TIME.
THIS IS AN ELEMENT OF THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DETAILED AND TECHNICAL INTELLECTUAL DEBATE.
HAVING LISTENED TO MUCH OF IT, NOTHING HAS BEEN AS HELPFUL TO ME AS THE THOUGHTS OF A TEACHER, A PRINCIPAL, AND A STUDENT FROM BENT TREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN MIAMI.
LET’S LISTEN TO BERYL GRANT, BART CHRISTIE, AND JESUS ALVAREZ AS THEY DISCUSS THE FCAT TEST.
BERYL GRANT: THE FCAT REALLY IS PREPARING THEM FOR LIFE AND LIFE BEYOND SCHOOL, WHICH IS WORK, AND ALSO COLLEGE.
WE HAVE TO READ, THINK AND EXPLAIN.
AND THAT TO ME IS WHAT FCAT IS ALL ABOUT.
BART CHRISTIE: THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE OUR SCHOOL FROM A D-SCHOOL TO A B-SCHOOL.
WE MISSED AN A-SCHOOL BY ABOUT THREE PERCENTILE POINTS, WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS.
WE ARE GOING TO BE AN A-SCHOOL THIS YEAR.
JESUS ALVAREZ: THE EXTRAORDINARY FCAT FCAT OH FCAT, WE WORK FOR YOU EVERY YEAR SOMETIMES YOU SCARE US, BUT IT’S ONLY OUR FEAR WE LEARN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, AND ALSO TO READ OUR TEACHERS MAKE SURE, THAT IN LIFE WE’LL SUCCEED HURRAY FOR BENT TREE, ‘CAUSE WE GOT A B WE THOUGHT YOU’RE A MONSTER, BUT NOW WE ARE BRAVE WE’LL MAKE THAT A, SO BENT TREE CAN RAVE!
WHEN I SHAKED GOVERNOR BUSH’S HAND, HE SAID, ‘GOOD JOB, YOU CAN TAKE THAT POEM ON THE ROAD’ AND MR. CHRISTY CONGRATULATED ME….
WELL, JESUS HAS TAKEN IT ON THE ROAD, AND HE IS WITH US TODAY IN THE GALLERY.
PLEASE STAND, JESUS.
WHEN I VISITED BENT TREE ELEMENTARY, JESUS REMINDED ME, AND I THINK REMINDS US ALL, THAT CHANGE AND NEW IDEAS CAN SEEM PRETTY SCARY AT FIRST.
BUT HE ALSO REMINDS US WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WHEN WE CHALLENGE OURSELVES, WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IN JUST TWO YEARS.
JESUS AND OTHERS LIKE HIM WILL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT IN MY PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR, WE HAVE ASKED THAT YOU PROVIDE MORE THAN $6 MILLION TO PROVIDE COMPUTERIZED TUTORING FOR THE READING, WRITING AND MATH SKILLS MEASURED BY THE FCAT SO THAT STUDYING CAN TAKE PLACE ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
THIS IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE $531 MILLION I HAVE REQUESTED IN INCREASED K-12 FUNDING THIS YEAR, AND AN EVEN SMALLER PART OF THE $2 BILLION IN INCREASED FUNDING WE WILL THEN HAVE APPROPRIATED IN THE LAST THREE BUDGETS.
I HAVE ALSO ASKED THAT WE REFOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON BRINGING MORE AND BETTER TEACHERS TO FLORIDA’S CLASSROOMS.
OUR GROWING STUDENT POPULATION HAS CREATED AN UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR TEACHERS IN THIS STATE.
OUR TEACHER SHORTAGE THREATENS TO UNDERMINE THE ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE MADE.
WE MUST BEGIN A TEN-YEAR PROJECT TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN 160,000 TEACHERS TO MEET THE PROJECTED DEMAND IN FLORIDA.
LAST YEAR, ALMOST 9% OF FLORIDA’S TEACHING FORCE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, AND THE NEED FOR NEW TEACHERS ONLY GROWS.
LET’S HEAR FROM CLAUDE ARCHER AS HE SHARES HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS PROBLEM.
CLAUDE ARCHER: MY NAME IS CLAUDE ARCHER.
I WAS A TEACHER AT MARJORIE STONEMAN DOUGLAS ELEMENTARY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.
NOW I RECRUIT AND HIRE TEACHERS FOR THE COUNTY.
WE’RE TRYING TO ATTRACT MID-CAREER PROFESSIONALS LOOKING FOR A CHANGE, LOOKING FOR SOME MORE MEANING TO WHAT THEY’RE DOING.
THEY’RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE MEANINGFUL.
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN LIVES OF CHILDREN.
WE’RE LOOKING FOR THEM.
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT CHANGING CAREERS, I ALWAYS TELL THEM THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB THERE IS.
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TOUCH THE LIFE OF A CHILD AND WHAT YOU DO WILL IMPACT THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
BUT THERE IS NO GREATER FEELING THAN ONE DAY HAVING A STUDENT WALK INTO YOU CLASSROOM AND SAY, ‘YOU DON’T REMEMBER ME, DO YOU?
BUT YOU WERE MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, OR YOU WERE MY ENGLISH TEACHER, AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID TO ME HAVE REALLY TOUCHED ME AND MADE A DIFFERENCE, AND I’M HERE TODAY, WHERE I AM, BECAUSE OF YOU.
I THINK IT’S CRITICAL THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN TEACHERS.
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR BUSH FOR ALL HIS EFFORTS AND FOR MAKING EDUCATION HIS TOP PRIORITY.
AFTER LISTENING TO CLAUDE AND MANY DEDICATED EDUCATORS LIKE HIM, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FLORIDA’S CLASSROOM TEACHERS.
THE PLAN CONTAINS MORE THAN TWENTY SEPARATE INITIATIVES AIMED AT GETTING AND KEEPING GREAT TEACHERS.
THIS YEAR, I HAVE ASKED FOR $169 MILLION IN TOTAL FUNDING OF NEW AND ONGOING TEACHER-RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION INITIATIVES.
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE FOR TEACHER SIGNING BONUSES TO ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS.
WE MUST ALSO OFFER ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT TEACHER CERTIFICATION POLICIES TO ENABLE QUALIFIED FLORIDIANS WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND ENHANCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHERS TO INCREASE JOB SATISFACTION.
THESE CHANGES WILL HELP OUR YOUNG.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE FLORIDIANS WHO ARE ELDERLY, OR HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS?
THIS SESSION I ASK YOU TO BRING AN UNPARALLELED FOCUS ON LONG-TERM CARE FOR FLORIDIANS.
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO I MET JERRY PRICE AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE, JEANNE.
THEY PROVIDE A COMPELLING REMINDER OF WHY YOU AND I HAVE BEEN SENT TO TALLAHASSEE.
THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED, JEANNE WAS DIVERTED FROM A NURSING HOME AND GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO LIVE WITH HER BELOVED HUSBAND AND THEIR PET BIRD, SHAKESPEARE.
WE SAVED THE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND WE DRAMATICALLY ELEVATED JEANNE’S QUALITY OF LIFE.
I’D LIKE YOU TO MEET THEM AND HEAR THEIR EXPERIENCE.
JERRY PRICE: THIS IS JEANNE, MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE, JEANNE PRICE AND I’M JERRY PRICE.
AND WE’VE BEEN MARRIED GOING ON 51 YEARS.
JEANNE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER’S, WITH PARKINSON’S, SHE’S A DIABETIC, SHE’S HAD TWO OPEN-HEART SURGERIES.
SHE RELIES UPON BEING HOME FOR HER HAPPINESS AND SHE WOULDN’T HAVE THAT IN A NURSING HOME.
SO I KNOW THAT IF WE DIDN’T HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOW, IF WE DIDN’T HAVE THE LONG-TERM CARE AND THE BEACON HELPING US, IT WOULD NOT WORK OUT FOR US AT ALL.
IT’S PROVIDED HER WITH COUNSELING, AND IT’S PROVIDED HER WITH MEALS, AND IT’S PROVIDED HER WITH HOMECARE… AND THERE ISN’T ANYTHING THAT WE NEED THAT WE DON’T GET FROM THIS PROGRAM.
ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS BECAUSE OUR MEANS THAT WE’RE TOGETHER AND WITHOUT YOU, WE WOULD NOT BE TOGETHER.
SHE WOULD BE IN A NURSING HOME, I WOULD BE WORKING SIX JOBS TO PAY FOR HER.
THE QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN THE DRAIN.
AND I THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU AND THAT’S ALL WE CAN SAY.
I HAVE TO SAY, IT’S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING THAT SHAKESPEARE BEHAVES SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY DOG MARVIN.
FOR JEANNE AND FOLKS LIKE HER, I PROPOSE THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO FUNCTION WITHIN THEIR HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY.
WITH THE MORE-THAN-$50- MILLION INCREASE I HAVE SUGGESTED IN MY RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOU, WE WILL HAVE INCREASED FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY-BASED CARE BY MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.
THESE MONIES WILL HELP SENIORS AGE WITH DIGNITY IN PLACES THEY CHERISH, NEAR PEOPLE THEY LOVE.
WE WILL ALSO DEDICATE $30 MILLION TO HELP LOW-INCOME SENIORS BUY THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY NEED.
FOR THOSE SENIORS WHO NEED NURSING HOMES, I HAVE PROPOSED $46 MILLION IN NEW FUNDING THIS YEAR TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF NURSING HOME CARE BY DECREASING STAFF TURNOVER AND INCREASING STAFF-TO-RESIDENT RATIOS.
BUT MORE MONEY ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THE CRISIS IN NURSING HOME CARE.
NURSING HOMES TEETER ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY IN FLORIDA, AND MANY WILL GO UNDER IF WE DO NOT TAKE DECISIVE ACTION TO STABILIZE THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS BY PROVIDING LAWSUIT RELIEF.
IF NURSING HOMES CLOSE THEIR DOORS, SENIORS COULD BE LEFT WITHOUT THE SERVICES THEY VITALLY REQUIRE AT THIS VULNERABLE TIME IN THEIR LIVES.
EVEN IF THE NURSING HOMES SURVIVE, BUT ARE FINANCIALLY WEAKENED, THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE COULD DECLINE, AND HARM OUR ELDERS.
NURSING HOMES IN FLORIDA ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SUED THAN IN OTHER STATES, PUTTING THE COSTS OF LIABILITY INSURANCE AT EIGHT TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
WOULDN’T IT BE BETTER FOR NURSING HOMES TO SPEND MONEY ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF CARE RATHER THAN PAYING INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND LAWYERS’ BILLS?
YOUR AGENDA THIS YEAR SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE ELEVATING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL FLORIDIANS.
THERE IS PERHAPS NO STATE PROGRAM THAT HAS MORE POTENTIAL FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS THAN THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT ACT, AND NONE THAT HAS REMAINED MORE DISTANT FROM ITS GOAL.
DESPITE DECADES OF IMPLEMENTATION, OUR ROADS REMAIN CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC, IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCES ARE THREATENED OR DESTROYED, AND COMMUNITY NEEDS LIKE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT FULLY MET.
LAST YEAR, I FORMED A COMMISSION TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT ACT.
I CAREFULLY CONSIDERED WHO SHOULD LEAD THE TASK FORCE, AND I CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO POSSESSED THE STATURE AND COURAGE TO SQUARELY CONFRONT THE IMPLICATIONS OF DEVELOPMENT.
I CHOSE THEN-ORANGE COUNTY CHAIRMAN MEL MARTINEZ, WHO HAD STRONGLY PUSHED TO LIMIT GROWTH IN AREAS OF HIS COUNTY UNTIL SCHOOL OVERCROWDING WAS DEALT WITH.
ALTHOUGH MEL HAS SINCE GONE ON TO BECOME THE SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN WASHINGTON, HE’S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO JOIN US TODAY TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS COMMISSION’S PROPOSALS.
MEL, PLEASE STAND.
THANK YOU.
MEL AND THE OTHER COMMISSION MEMBERS HAVE PROPOSED THAT WE NOT BLINDLY PERMIT DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF OUR ABILITY TO BUILD SCHOOLS, I AGREE, IT IS TIME TO STOP DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL.
TODAY IS THE DAY WE SAY, “WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES TO SWELL WITHOUT NEW CLASSROOMS.
WE WILL NO LONGER ALLOW FLORIDA TO BE SOLD ON THE CHEAP.
I ALSO ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE GAINS IN PROVIDING TAX RELIEF FOR OUR CITIZENS.
THIS YEAR, WE PROPOSE THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF FOUR CUTS AIMED AT ULTIMATELY ELIMINATING THE INTANGIBLES TAX, A TAX THAT PUNISHES SENIORS AND SAVERS.
LET’S HEAR FROM JUDY CLARK OF LAKE MARY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.
JUDY CLARK: HI, MY NAME IS JUDY CLARK AND I LIVE IN LAKE MARY, FLORIDA.
ALL OF MY WORKING YEARS AND MOST OF THE TIME, TWO JOBS SINCE I RAISED FOUR CHILDREN ALONE, AND I PAID TAX ON EVERY DOLLAR I EARNED.
AND THEN I SAVED SOME MONEY AND I INHERITED MONEY AND I HAD TO PAY TAXES AT THAT TIME, AND NOW I’M STILL PAYING TAXES ON THAT SAME MONEY.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR JEB BUSH AND OUR LEGISLATORS FOR REDUCING THIS TAX BY PERCENTAGES EACH YEAR.
AND HOPEFULLY, IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, IT WILL BE ABOLISHED COMPLETELY.
JUDY, YOU SEEM PRETTY FOCUSED ON GETTING RID OF THE INTANGIBLES TAX, AND SO SHOULD WE.
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO LET YOU KEEP YOUR LIFE SAVINGS.
AMONG INDIVIDUALS, SENIORS OVER 60 PAY ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF THIS TAX.
WE MUST STOP PUNISHING THEM FOR THEIR THRIFT.
THIS YEAR, WE PROPOSE RAISING THE INDIVIDUAL EXEMPTION FROM $20,000 TO $250,000, THE JOINT EXEMPTION FROM $40,000 TO $500,000, AND THE EXEMPTION FOR FLORIDA’S BUSINESSES FROM ZERO TO $250,000.
THESE WILL HAVE THE REMARKABLE EFFECT OF REMOVING MORE THAN 500,000 FLORIDIANS FROM THE TAX ROLLS.
I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT TAXING PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES OR TAXING THE CAPITAL THAT GROWS SMALL BUSINESSES IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY, THAT IT HARMS PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES WHEN THEY CAN LEAST AFFORD TO BE TAXED BY GOVERNMENT.
WHEN WE SOUGHT AND ACHIEVED SIMILAR TAX CUTS IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, OVER 90% OF THE MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES VOTED IN FAVOR OF THEM.
I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE THIS BI-PARTISAN APPROACH WITH THE GOAL OF ULTIMATELY ELIMINATING THE TAX ALTOGETHER.
IMPROVING PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PROVIDING QUALITY LONG-TERM CARE, DEALING WITH DEVELOPMENT, CUTTING TAXES -- THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE PUBLIC AGENDA.
APPROPRIATELY, THEY FOCUS ON THE NEEDS THAT DIRECTLY CONFRONT THOSE WE ARE BOUND TO SERVE.
BUT THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT IS MORE INTERNALLY FOCUSED, AND YET, JUST AS IMPORTANT, AND UNLESS WE ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IT, STATE GOVERNMENT JEOPARDIZES ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER IN ALL OTHER AREAS.
I SPEAK OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
BEFORE YOU HEAR MY THOUGHTS, I’D LIKE YOU TO HEAR THE THOUGHTS OF GOV.
ROY BARNES OF GEORGIA.
GOV.
ROY BARNES (D-GA): HI, MY NAME IS ROY BARNES, GOVERNOR OF YOUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH, THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA.
WE ALL KNOW WE ARE LIVING IN A CHANGING SOCIETY.
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, PERSONNEL POLICIES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND NOT FOR PROFIT WORLD HAVE EVOLVED DRAMATICALLY MAKING ORGANIZATIONS MORE COMPETITIVE AND EFFICIENT.
STATE GOVERNMENTS MUST DO THE SAME IF WE ARE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES OUR CITIZENS DEMAND WITH THE SAME SPEED AND SERVICE THEY’VE COME TO EXPECT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
FIVE YEARS AGO GEORGIA TOOK A GIANT STEP WHEN WE INSTITUTED PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION INSTEAD OF THE INFLEXIBLE CONSTRAINTS OF THE MERIT SYSTEM.
OVER HALF OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES ARE NOW EMPLOYED AND COMPENSATED BASED ON PERFORMANCE RATHER THAN STATUS.
AND THAT NUMBER IS GROWING EVERY DAY.
GOVERNMENT CAN NEVER HAVE THE FULL CONFIDENCE OF ITS PEOPLE IF IT DOES NOT KEEP IN STEP WITH THE REST OF SOCIETY.
PERFORMANCE BASED EMPLOYMENT IS NOT ONLY DESIRED IT IS ESSENTIAL IF STATES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AS ECONOMIC GENERATORS OF PROSPERITY.
BASED ON GEORGIA’S EXPERIENCE, I ENCOURAGE FLORIDA IN ITS EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE ITS STATE WORKFORCE.
AND WE WILL, GOVERNOR.
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU, WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT REFORMS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS.
WE ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO TRANSFORM STATE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE STRATEGIC USE OF TECHNOLOGY.
NOW IT IS TIME TO REFORM OUR EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM SO THAT, LIKE THE WORLD-CLASS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING FLORIDA’S ECONOMY, STATE GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE THAT ITS 16 MILLION CITIZENS RIGHTFULLY EXPECT.
LAST WEEK, WE ANNOUNCED A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM PROPOSAL NAMED SERVICE FIRST, AND TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT INITIATIVE.
I ALSO ASK, DESPITE THE RELATIVE AUSTERITY THAT WILL CHARACTERIZE OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR, THAT WE BEGIN TO MOVE TO A COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT IS COMPETITIVE AND REWARDING FOR OUR DEDICATED STATE WORKERS.
I URGE YOU TO MAINTAIN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO REWARD BETTER OUR HARD WORKING STATE EMPLOYEES.
AND FINALLY, WE MUST MAKE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE THE VERY MACHINERY OF DEMOCRACY, THE VOTING PROCESS.
FOR 37 DAYS LAST FALL, FLORIDA WAS THRUST ONTO THE WORLD STAGE AS WE WAITED FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
SOME WOULD SAY THAT MANY IN THIS ROOM SOLIDIFIED THEIR PLACE IN HISTORY FROM THEIR ROLES IN THAT EVENT.
BUT NEITHER THE HISTORY OF THE 2000 CAMPAIGN NOR YOUR OWN HISTORY IS FULLY WRITTEN, AND THE ACTION YOU TAKE THIS SESSION WILL PROVIDE A LENS THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTION CAN BE BETTER JUDGED.
I SAY LET US BE KNOWN AS A PEOPLE WHO ARE HUMBLE ENOUGH TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SHORTCOMINGS, AND PRINCIPLED ENOUGH TO SEEK TO CORRECT THEM.
I ASK THAT WE DEDICATE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO MODERNIZE OUR VOTING SYSTEMS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE INTO THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.
I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS TODAY, OUTLINING SOME CHANGES WE MIGHT CONSIDER.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, I HOPE YOU’VE LISTENED TO THE THOUGHTS OF THE OTHERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN TODAY.
I LOOK FORWARD TO LISTENING TO YOUR IDEAS FOR CHANGE AS WE WORK TOGETHER DURING THE SESSION.
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID, “THE SOFT-MINDED MAN ALWAYS FEARS CHANGE.
HE FEELS SECURITY IN THE STATUS QUO, AND HE HAS AN ALMOST MORBID FEAR OF THE NEW.
FOR HIM, THE GREATEST PAIN, IS THE PAIN OF A NEW IDEA.
LOOKING AMONG YOU TODAY, I SEE NO FEAR OF THE NEW.
EVERY REVOLUTION NECESSARILY BEGINS WITH ONE PERSON, RELENTLESSLY PURSUING A DEEP AND COMPELLING INTERNAL VISION.
WHY SHOULDN’T THAT REVOLUTION BEGIN WITH YOU?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL.
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS FLORIDA.
