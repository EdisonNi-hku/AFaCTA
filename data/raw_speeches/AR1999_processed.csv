SENTENCES
Thank you.Thank you very much.Thank you.
"Mr. Speaker, thank you so very much for the gracious welcome; Governor Rockefeller, for the introduction today, for your kindness."
"To all the members of the House and Senate, I extend first of all my congratulations to each of you."
I watched from the distance as you took your offices yesterday.
"I marveled at and was thrilled by the comments made by both the president pro tem of the Senate and the speaker of the House, and I thought the tone that was set yesterday was exactly the right kind of tone."
"I want to also say a sincere thanks to all the members of the executive Cabinet, folks that have been working very diligently over the past two years to prepare a budget that we'll be working on, bring forth ideas, visions for our state that were presented from the various agencies."
"And I could not ask, no governor could ask, for a finer group of dedicated people to serve with than the people I have the privilege of serving with in the Cabinet.A special thanks to my staff."
"These are the folks who make me look good, and when I don't, it's my fault; and they remind me of that every time."
"They are a wonderful group of people, every one of them."
"They're a team, and I could not function without them."
And I'm so grateful for the dedication that they have to do their duties and to do their work for the people of Arkansas and for the things we want to set forth.
Perhaps most of all it's important that I say a word of thanks to my family because no one has endured more than they have in terms of getting to this very special moment.
"Through the rigors of several campaigns over the past several years, they have stood faithful, strong, courageous and unyielding to the pressures."
"And to my children -- John Mark, David, and Sarah -- I thank you and I love you for what you have meant and for how you have continued to bless my life."
"I do want you to do better in school, make better grades."
(laughter) But you've blessed my life all the same.
A special tribute today is in order for my wife and Arkansas' first lady.
"No governor, no person could ever ask for a better partner than I have in Janet."
"And she has been tireless in her efforts to go forth across this state to improve immunization for children, to try to be an ambassador of goodwill to the people of our state, to encourage children in classrooms and most of all to try to represent all of us in a way that would make us proud."
And I think she has made us proud.
"She has certainly made me proud, and I'm so grateful that she has been willing to hang in there through it all and is at my side today."
"(applause) The last time I addressed this body in an opening session of a General Assembly, the 81st, there were some complaints about some of my humor and the plainspokenness of it."
"I tried my very best to temper all of my comments today, but I will tell you that it did remind me of Harry Truman's experience speaking to the Washington Garden Club."
"As he spoke to that august group of ladies, he on several occasions in the course of his address used the term ""the use of good manure."
"Well, when it was finished, some of the ladies went to Bess Truman and said: ""Bess, don't you think you could get Harry to quit using the word ?manure?"
and maybe use the word ?fertilizer. ''
"And Bess said, ""Ladies, you just don't understand how long it took me to get him to use the word ?manure. """
(laughter) Most of us as we sit here or stand here today are quite frankly in places we never imagined we would be as we were children growing up.
"Most of us I think marvel at the fact that we are a part of something that is historic, that we have the opportunity to continue on in the great tradition of serving the people of Arkansas in the capacity as lawmakers and from the executive branch."
I looked yesterday at many of you.I look at you today.
I think this is one of those times we've all dressed up and gussied up for the occasion.
"Several years ago, a Baptist pastor friend of mine visited a family and asked them to come to church.And they wouldn?t come."
"He finally just said, ""How come you folks won't come?"""
"They said, ""You know, we just don?t have the right kind of clothes.He thought, ""I can fix that."
"So he went and gathered up donations and got some wonderful clothes, took it over to the family.They were so grateful."
"The following Sunday, they didn't show up for church."
"The following Sunday, they didn't come, and the next Sunday."
And the pastor began to get worried.
"After all, he had met that need of the clothes."
"So he went over to their home and he said, ""You know, you guys said you couldn't come to church because you didn't have good clothes, and we brought you some wonderful clothes.Were they not nice enough?"""
"They said, ""Oh, pastor, they were nice all right."
"In fact, they were incredibly nice."
"They were so nice that when we got dressed up, we felt like we were good enough to go to the Episcopal church."
"Looking around here today, I'd say we could all go to the Episcopal church, Sen. Beebe."
I understand most of us have come to this point of being sworn in having been through a tough election season.
"And the truth is, if the people had believed everything that had been said about any of us, none of us would have been elected."
"Therefore, we need to remember why it is that we got on the ballot in the first place.Why are we here?"
I know it's for each of us a unique story.
"I said to several people in the press who have interviewed me over the past few days that there are 135 very special stories, and it's the people who serve in the Arkansas General Assembly."
"Each could tell about a childhood dream, each could tell about a compelling adult conviction, to take the risk and put one's name on the ballot and one's neck on the line, to go to fellow citizens and say, ""I need your support."
"And to go through the humiliation of having some of those you thought were your best friends tell you not only no, they wouldn't help you, insisting instead that you needed serious psychiatric help."
Probably there have been some days during the course of the campaign and beyond that you thought maybe they were right.But now here you are.
And today I hope that what we can do is to start this session by remembering why it is we're here.
A Jewish friend of mine sent me a letter that arrived just Friday.
And in that letter he reminded me of the story of an old Jewish man who was planting a fig tree as a Roman soldier passed by.
"The soldier stopped, and he was laughing at the man."
"He called him foolish and said, ""Don't you know you'll be dead and completely gone by the time that tree bears fruit?"""
"The old man replied, ""All my life I have enjoyed the fruit of trees that others planted."
"Should I not plant for the benefit of those who will come after me?"""
"When it is really said and done, what we have gathered here to do is to plant the trees for the benefit of those who will come after us."
Our challenges here are not to simply face the issues that will help us in the next election.
Our challenges are to face the issues that will help Arkansas in the next generation.
Our challenge is not simply to decide what it is that we need to do for the immediate but rather what it is we must do for the ultimate.
And a friendly word of counsel to you as well as to myself.
"If you really want to be loved, you had better go ahead and leave this chamber now."
"The truth is, you'll never be more popular than you are on the day you're sworn in."
"You'll discover soon enough that on some days you're the pigeon and on some days you're the statue, and more often than not, the statue."
This morning began for me with a prayer service at our church.
It was a wonderful experience for me and perhaps it will remain the highlight of the day.
I'm mindful of the fact that you and I are all here by providence.
And that for me is a very serious thing.
"I could not help but think of the prayer of King Solomon, I Kings, Chapter 3, Verses 8 and 9."
I thought it appropriate because it really is my prayer.
"It goes, ""Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number."
"So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong, for who is able to govern this people of yours?"""
There are pollsters and pundits and others who would tell us what to do.
The pollsters will tell us what the people think.
The pundit will tell us what he thinks.
The prophet will tell us what God thinks.
"I?m convinced that if we want a successful venture in this body, we need to govern by the principles of right and wrong, not by polls, not by pundits, not by parties, not by the pessimists, but rather by the principles that caused each of us to seek election."
It doesn't mean those principles always are going to be in lockstep agreement with one another.
"But when people of conviction and compelling faith can gather together, and when they base their debate on the depth of their conviction and on the very heart of their being, and they argue to their last breath their position because they truly believe it, there is no dishonor in losing."
And there is no sense of overwhelming triumph in winning.
It is the process that has won at that moment.
"And it is our whole frame of government that has risen to the occasion to supersede even the issue of the day, to prove the wonderful wisdom with which our founding fathers brought forth this government that carries on with honor and with dignity."
All of us need to remember not to give too much attention to our critics.It's hard to do sometimes.
But I always remind myself that the critics are usually those who didn't have the courage to enter the game.
They're just the ones who want to make the rules for the rest of us.
"The critics are generally those who file no disclosures, they never put forth an SFI."
"They're not the ones who are subject to the ridicule, the humiliation."
"They are not cartooned, lampooned or harpooned."
They are the ones who wonderfully and quietly wait in their corners for some of us to say or do something they find somehow off the mark.
And they will spend a lot of time telling us what we should have and could have done.
"But remember, you sit in the seat in that Senate and you sit in a seat in this House because you did something the critics didn't do.You rose up to the occasion."
You put your name forth and offered yourself as a candidate.
And you were willing to do something that very few people will ever be willing to do.
You were willing to become a servant of the people and to be a member of this body.
The laws we pass in these next few days will carry Arkansas into the 21st century.
"The truth is, the law of Arkansas does not require us to do anything, but we are compelled to do many things."
"As I gather with you this morning, I guess the overwhelming question is what is the state of the state?How is Arkansas doing?"
"Well, I think I can happily report to you today that Arkansas is doing very, very well."
"And part of the reason it's doing well is because of the actions that were taken in this very place two years ago, a program that had 35 votes in the Senate, 100 votes in the House, called ARKids First, a landmark program for children."
"Of all the things I think I'll ever be part of as a governor, I can't imagine anything that would be more cherished in my own heart than is the ARKids program."
"And I remember so vividly as we put forth the ARKids effort, wondering what it would mean for children.Let me give you the good news."
"In the year and a half that program has been in place, 50,000 applications for Arkansas children have been filed."
We now have tens of thousands of children in our state who go to the doctor rather than simply remain sick.
They get primary and preventive health care they never got before.And these aren't welfare kids.
These are kids of working moms and dads.
Bill Adams and his wife Shawnee up in Fort Smith are a couple who can tell you about the benefits of ARKids.
"On Christmas Day, their son, Brian, marked his eighth month of life."
Brian was born with a club foot and he had to wear braces for five months.
"But surgery as a result of ARKids First will make him able to enjoy the same kind of play, running and walking all of our kids perhaps enjoyed."
And that's because many of you in this room today voted two years ago to believe in something that is working.
"It would also mean the same kind of testimony from Pam Gober, a single mother from North Little Rock who has four kids."
Pam?s four kids are able to get medical treatment.
They are able to go to the doctor.
They are not missing as much school.
She is not missing as much work as a result of having to stay and take care of them.
And that's because of some things we did.
The state of Arkansas is good today because we took some actions two years ago that made it better.
Almost all of us grew up hearing the complaints of how hard it was to get something simple like a car tag.
"And we passed the car tag bill, now called STAR for streamlined auto renewal system."
"On Jan. 1 of this year, just 12 days ago, it went into full effect, and it means that our technology is not only state of the art, but it's actually more advanced than most ATMs around the world in bringing a person to his car tag quicker than ever before, by way of internet, telephone, by mail or, if they insist, they can still walk into a revenue office and do it the old-fashioned way."
But they will do it quicker than they?ve ever done it and they will do it for a dollar cheaper than it was ever done.Welfare reform is working.
There were many who were skeptical.
"But two years after we passed the bill, 43 percent of the people who were on welfare aren't anymore."
And those who thought that our employment numbers would plummet and our unemployment numbers would rise were wrong.
Today Arkansas enjoys the highest level of employment and the lowest level of unemployment that it has enjoyed in some 30 years.Our economy is strong.
"In the last year alone, 9,200 jobs were created by the work of AEDC with incomes rising 34 percent above the year before."
That's an 81 percent increase from just the year prior.
"More people are going to work for better jobs, making better money than they ever have in Arkansas before."
"And at the same time, fewer are getting a handout.More are getting a hand up."
We launched the Smart Start initiative.
One hundred seventy-thousand kids in grades K through four will now understand that the emphasis is on reading and mathematics and character-centered education.
"And every child in Arkansas will not be allowed to wait until he or she is in the 11th or 12th grade to discover they aren?t capable of working out simple math equations, making decent sentences or pointing to the nation's capital on the map."
"Now because of Smart Start, every single kid in these lower grades K-4 will get the solid foundation to become good students."
"And we know if they start right, they have a much better chance of finishing right."
"But if they don't start right, there is not much chance at all that they will finish right."
"I would also like to think about the effects of the 1/8-cent conservation money that has rebuilt so many state parks, added a number of new enforcement officers, acquired public lands so kids in Arkansas can grow up, no matter how poor they are, with the opportunity to hunt and fish and enjoy the outdoors that God so beautifully gave us in this state of ours.The tax cuts are in effect."
Many Arkansas families are going to enjoy more of their own income.They earned it.
"This body allowed them to keep it, thanks to the courageous vote that we made two years ago."
"I want to say one of the most significant things, which is not exactly a headline item but significant nonetheless, is the fact that today the agencies of the state of Arkansas cooperate as never before."
We have department directors who talk to each other about how to solve problems.
"We ended many of the turf battles that so often existed between one branch of government and others, and between one department and agency against another."
We insisted that they sit down at the same table and come out with solutions that are benefiting the people of Arkansas rather than any individual agency.And it's working.
"There are a lot of other things -- the Hooked on Fishing, Not on Drugs program, which is a simple volunteer program that works in the schools.But it's working."
"There are some 14 clubs around the state and the reports we are getting back, like from Mountain View Middle School, are that they have fewer discipline problems."
"The kids are academically performing better because of programs like that.Play It Again, Arkansas.Simple program.Doesn't require tax money."
"It just says that people who have old band instruments in their attic ought to get them out of the attic, dust them off and donate them to the local band."
There are hundreds of kids in Arkansas today who have instruments they wouldn't have had otherwise.
Over in Mena there?s a lady named Susan Strider.
"Susan has three kids, two are twins, both wanted to play in the band."
But musical instruments can cost as much as $100 a month to rent.
"Play It Again, Arkansas has put musical instruments in the hands of her twins, Casey and Christopher."
The result of that is those two kids are now first chair in the school band.
And that may not seem like a whole lot.
"But I want to say something to all of us: When we are debating the big issues of the day, when we think we have the world by the tail and the things that we are talking about are so significant, I never want us to forget the kids like those two kids in Mena."
Because those two kids are really why we are down here.
"Whether it's medical care to get them to the doctor or to give them the same chance as any other kid to pick up a horn and play it well, and learn the value of teamwork and discipline and practice, all those lessons will build a better Arkansas."
"No, we may not get re-elected because of any of those things, but I assure you, like my friend said in the story he sent me, we're planting trees."
Somebody else will get to bear the fruit.
"As we gather here today, we have some major challenges before us."
I said many times I think there are four major items we have to confront.One of them is education.
"The Smart Start initiative is under way, but to really make it work there are some things we have to do in these next 60 to 70, to 80, to 90, to -- God forbid-- 100 days we may be here."
I think it will be closer to 60 than 100.
"And I'm sure many of you are saying, ""I hope so, too."
One of the things we need to do here is repeal some of the restricting legislation that makes it very difficult for schools to operate because they are busy trying to keep up with legislative mandates that they don't have time to give full attention to the students.
"We also need to make sure we never, ever go backward in per pupil funding.We won't propose it."
"And even if we did, you wouldn't allow it."
"And I think that's one thing upon which we can readily agree today and drive a stake in the ground and say Arkansas students will have more money, not less money, as a result of this General Assembly getting together in Little Rock."
"(applause) As we focus on education, Smart Start will help our kids get started right."
"But if they do what we want them to do, we need to make sure that at the end of that education there is some reason for them to go on."
"We are going to propose an autonomy of our technical schools, not only to give them the opportunity to better train our people for the workforce but to give us a greater level of accountability for those technical schools."
I think it will be a very important stride forward in the area of education for the workforce.
I'm going to ask you for something of significance when I ask you to join and expand the Academic Challenge Scholarship program.
"Right now, that scholarship program doesn't go to any great value to families who earn more than $35,000 or $40,000 a year."
There are a lot of families in Arkansas who earn more than that but struggle to get their kids in college.
"As a result, we are losing a lot of our good kids.They are going out of state."
I want to keep the best and brightest right here in Arkansas.
"Whenever I go out and talk to high school students, I ask, ""How many are going to college?""I ask for a show of hands."
"I say, ""How many are staying in state for education?"""
"When those who say they are going out of state lift their hands, I ask them why."
"And when I hear that money is one of the reasons, that they can just as easily go out of state as they can in the state, I see one more reason that we need to expand the Academic Challenge Scholarship, and I'll ask you to do it by raising that limit to $70,000 so more students in Arkansas will decide that staying here is a good investment if they make the grades and test scores, and they continue to be drug free.Simple guidelines."
"They are not too tough, but they are tough enough to be a challenge, and they are simple enough that a lot of students in Arkansas will get the benefit of the equivalent of a $10,000 grant to go to college."
Is that going to cost us money?$6.83 million the first year.
"I promise you if we do it, it will receive back for the state of Arkansas many, many dollars more than we ever will have spent because it will be an investment in the quality of life for our students."
I want to see us do charter schools and move Arkansas forward so that every school system has a chance to chart its own course.
I also want to make sure that education always has accountability in all that we do.
Another major thing we have to tackle -- and we only have one shot to do it -- is a reform in the property tax system.
"Most of us probably had the living daylights scared out of us when we saw the petition drives, and I can tell you, if that had stayed on the ballot it would have passed and with a comfortable enough margin that we would have understood that if the voters didn't get our attention through that petition drive and we don't do something about it, they will have our undivided attention in the next election."
So we have an opportunity to do what's right and what's responsible.
And what's right and responsible are to me some simple things.
"Outline for the taxpayers what their rights are.Secondly, reform the system."
"Bring a fair fix to amendment 59 so there is uniformity and consistency about the way we go about assessing, collecting taxes from one district to the next and one county to the next.And bring some tax relief."
"Realistically, we are not going to be able to cut $200 million in taxes."
"If you can find that much in tax cuts, you'll be pulling off a miracle I haven't been able to figure out."
But there are ways we can bring some responsible relief to the people of our state.
The key issue is reforming a system that has caused some people's tax bills in a single year to go from $400 to $800 or from $400 to $900.
There is no way in the world you'll convince any Arkansan that that is fair or that that is right when the person over in the next county perhaps has had a tax bill that hasn't moved in 10 years.
"So it's our job, yours and mine, to figure out how to fix it."
"I've got some ideas, but I don't pretend to have all of them."
"In fact, I'm confident you have some that are as good or better than mine."
"I come with parameters saying we have to do something, but I don?t come with any preconceived notion that it has to be my way."
Today I say we will put out a slate.
"We will all draw on it, we will do erasing and changing."
"But when we leave here we had better have in place something that addresses this issue, or it will be addressed for us by people who may not take seriously the responsibility we have to fund education and human services."
A third area is juvenile justice reform.
What we must do is to somehow move between the balance of having a reaction to the horrible events that happened in Jonesboro and at the same time creating a tempered system where we recognize that the ultimate goal we should have is not simply to punish people who have done a horrible thing but to prevent people from ever getting to the place where they believe that doing a horrible thing is their only way to get attention.
"We're talking about changing the judicial process to a blended sentence, where a person is adjudicated perhaps as a child in the juvenile system but at the time that person becomes 18 is remanded into the adult system and evaluated regularly so one is not turned out on the streets just because he or she has blown out 18 candles on the birthday cake."
"While we must do those things, if we don't equally work to bring about some ways to intervene and prevent violence from overtaking our children, then simply coming up with new ways to adjudicate will have been a pitiful response to a very serious problem."
Another issue I'll ask you to join with me on -- it's one I don't think I'll have to convince you of the need -- is to improve Arkansas' highways and our transportation infrastructure.
I've often said you can get a free massage between Little Rock and West Memphis.
"Get in your car and drive on the right lane, it will be a massage or dislocation of several bones."
"But either way, you definitely will know the highways need a fix."
"The good news is because of some innovations in federal financing and the wonderful cooperation that has happened between the Governor's Council on Highways and Transportation, chaired by esteemed Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt, who is here today, and members of the Highway Commission, I believe we will be able to present to you from a unified position a plan to improve Arkansas?highways."
"Perhaps by the time the next General Assembly meets and certainly by the time the 84th Assembly meets, we will be able to look at the people of Arkansas and say that every single mile of interstate highway in Arkansas is in good or very good condition rather than the over 50 percent that now are at poor or very poor condition."
And we will do it without a tax increase except that of raising the diesel tax by 3 cents a gallon over a period of three years.
"And we will do it in such a way that it does not bring pain to the person who has to get up and go to work every day, that average citizen buying gasoline at the pump."
Because Arkansans are the people who drive further every day to work for less money than any other people in the country.
We can't afford to put a new burden on those hard-working people who struggle to put bologna on the table.
"What we must do is make sure that we find ways of innovative financing, regain the trust of the Arkansas people and build our highways and roads in such a way that all of us here can feel like we left a legacy of better transportation than ever before."
And I'll ask you to put your shoulder to the wheel and push hard with me to improve our highways.
And I hope you will join enthusiastically in that regard.
I think I can report to you that the Highway Commission and I have agreed to come together.
"You know, if you stop and think about that, that's pretty miraculous in itself."
"It's a darn good start if we can all work on the same team, and we have."
And I'm convinced that you and I can work together to make highways what they ought to be.
We're going to ask you to help make government more efficient as well as more ethical by performance-based budgeting.
By a career ladder and incentives for employees so we can keep our state employees longer by giving them incentives to stay.
By developing accounting that is based on activity-based costing.
"These may not be the most exciting things in the world, but it will make a big difference in the way we account for the taxpayers' money and bring a greater sense of honor to the system."
"We want to establish the office of inspector general, to give an independent audit to the manner in which state government conducts its business and tighten the procurement standards of our state."
We want to protect Arkansas citizens as never before.
Part of that will be through a Nursing Home Bill of Rights for every patient.
No one in a nursing home in Arkansas should feel that he or she does not have the absolute best care that is humanly possible.
"They are paying for it, and they ought to get it and we ought to demand it."
(applause) I'll ask to you establish regional crime labs as well as set up an electronic courthouse where video will be employed to allow people to testify in court by way of videotape.
"Right now, we've got many of our scientists, our forensic pathologists in the Crime Lab, who are spending 33 to 40 percent of their time traveling to or waiting to testify in cases rather than working on the evidence that is backed up."
"One way we can solve that, that is efficient and that is a part of the wave of the future, is to do it through the use of technology."
I'm going to ask you to continue the efforts to immunize every child in Arkansas.It's not that expensive.
"But boy oh boy, the cost of not immunizing is simply out of reach."
Let's continue to fight to bring the numbers of teen pregnancies down in Arkansas and the number of young women who grow up with a sense of hope and honor and dignity way up in Arkansas.
And let's make sure by adding the positions that we need to add at the Division of Children and Family Services that we don't have to have a court telling us how to love kids and care for kids and protect kids.
We do it because it's the right thing to do not because someone on a bench from a courtroom told us we had to.
Let's make sure that no child in Arkansas has the lack of protection and the lack of immediate access to care that every child needs and deserves.
(applause) There will be some challenges on welfare reform.
Some will perhaps want to go and extend the limits.
But let me share with you my strong conviction.
Our purpose in this session ought not to be to extend the time limits but rather to extend the opportunities for employment.
The two-year limit we currently have is working.
"It's not working for everybody, but it's not because the problem is the time limits."
The problem is we need to put a greater focus on job opportunity and job training.
"But in the midst of that, let's not forget for many Arkansans it is working."
"When I think about welfare reform in Arkansas, I think about a woman named Elaine who lives in Johnson County."
From the very beginning she wanted a better life for her family.
She started in one of our on-the-job training programs at a real estate office in Johnson County.
That work grew into a full-time job.
"She not only loves her work there, she is advancing."
"She is trying to get her real estate license, and here is an interesting story: The DHS staff in that local office chipped in and they bought her the books that woman needs to study for her license."
She is a person who will go from welfare to a good income because of her efforts and the friends who reached out to her and cared how she ended up.
Down the street from Elaine in Johnson County there is a woman named Donna.
She spent eight years cashing a welfare check.
She got involved with one of our Job Training Partnership Act programs.
The DHS workers found her a place to live near a Tyson plant.
They helped her fill out the employment application.
"Most importantly, they treated her with dignity, and they gave her respect."
They taught her the basics of looking for work.
"Donna was hired, and on the first day of work, one of the JTPA workers went by to pick her up.Donna wasn't there."
The reason Donna wasn't there was because she had already left her home early.
She didn't want to be late for work so she walked.
"My friends, when you hear about people on welfare and you hear that they're all lazy, it's not true."
"When you hear about people who are on welfare and they want to stay there, it's not true."
The people who are on welfare want off more than we want them off.
"Overwhelmingly, that's the truth."
But our challenge is not seeing if we can keep them on welfare a few more years.
It's to make sure we put our focus on job creation and our focus on economic development and that we give every one of these people the ladder out.
"I beg you, let's work together to make workforce development the focal point of welfare reform so we will improve the state of Arkansas and its people."
"(applause) I don't ever want us to forget that the people we are here to serve are not necessarily the ones who will roam these marble hallways and come in the nice suits, invite us to nice lunches, take us to nice dinners."
"The people we have to remember most are the folks like Elaine and Donna, and the people like Pam Gober whose kids are on ARKids."
"People like Bill and Shawnee up in Fort Smith, whose son Brian had the surgery this year, and the thousands like them."
"I want us to be reminded of the words of Jesus from Matthew, ""I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me."
"It may never make it in the paper, it may never lead the 6 o'clock news, but I promise you the things we do for those who have no real lobbyist down here, no real voice, those are the ones for whom I believe we have been placed."
"And most importantly, we should never forget that the only voice they may have in this Capitol is yours.Never forget them."
They sent you here with a mission.
Elections that we have all been through can be brutal.
I sometimes describe them like a demolition derby.
Only the people standing are the ones who end up showing up down here.
Some of you have been through some tough ones.Maybe you feel like I do.
"Sometimes you ask yourself, ""Is it worth it?"""
"And there are days, quite frankly, that I wonder if it is worth it."
"But then I come to a moment like today and I come with a sense of optimism, genuine optimism."
I've expressed that privately as well as publicly.
"I tell you that in this era of term limits, I don't see us somehow needing to be nervous and afraid of what the future holds."
"I'm genuinely thrilled about what the future holds because every one of you, I believe, has come with a civic mindedness that is genuine and real."
I've not talked today about our differences because I don't think they're really important to anybody out there.
They're only important to those of us in here.
"And I'm going to do my doggonest to put my focus on the people out there who sent me, just like I think you are."
It doesn't mean we won't get crossways with each other every now and then.
"It?s the nature of the beast, I think."
But I can tell you as a governor I?ve learned a lot from the session two years ago.
I'll take responsibility for many of the mistakes that led to sometimes contentious attitudes and sometimes wounded spirits.
"But I want to approach you today with a commitment that I may not agree with you on every issue and I'm sure you won't agree with me on every one, but I'll do my doggonest to treat you with the respect you deserve by having been elected by the people of Arkansas to sit where you sit today."
"And I'll do my best to do my arguing with you as privately as is possible, reserving the right of course to say tacky things when I want to."
"(laughter) I'm sincerely pledging that I want to build a genuine relationship so that when we leave here, in however many days it takes, the people of Arkansas have an education system that works, they have a criminal justice system that's fair and right, they can honestly know that they're going to have a highway system that will get them safely from point A to point B."
And that the people of Arkansas won't have to sign petitions and express their anger through the ballot because we will have listened to their anger and we will have fixed a system that needed fixing.
"When I get to thinking that I'm not sure I wanted to be here after all, I remember back to February of 1994, an experience that for me was life-changing."
I had run for office in '92 and lost.
"I ran for office in '93, and I won."
I discovered then that winning is better than losing.And I still believe it today.
In '94 it was the beginning of another election season.
"Having been elected in the special election, I had to start all over again."
"As had been my privilege to do on several occasions, I led a group of people on a spiritual pilgrimage to the nation of Israel.It was my eighth trip.I've been nine times."
And this time was one on which I was able to take all three of our children.
"The times that Janet and I had been before, they had never been."
I was so excited they were able to go even though they were young.
I was hoping they would really grasp what that would mean.
"When I take people to Israel, there is one thing that I absolutely insist we do."
"It?s to visit Yad Vashem, which is a memorial dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust."
"And some people say, ""Why do we want to go there?"
It?s not really part of our spiritual heritage.
"I said, ""More than you ever could understand it to be.You better believe it is."
No one has ever told me they wished they hadn't been.
"We went to Yad Vashem, and I got to thinking about my daughter, who at the time was 11.She is 16 now."
"This was the year before her 12th birthday, February of that year."
And I got to thinking I wasn't sure I wanted to take her to Yad Vashem because it's pretty powerful and emotional.
I wasn't sure that if I took she would comprehend and understand the impact of it all.
I did not want to overwhelm her and so overpower her that it would be too much.
I thought about it for a moment and I decided I needed to take her.
We may never get this way again and she needed to see what can happen when people fail to treat other people like people of equal value and worth.
And I wanted her to understand why it is that people who believe in something have to stand up and be counted and must not remain silent while the innocent are forgotten.
I took Sarah's hand and we started through Yad Vashem.
"The way it?s designed, you go through an exhibit and it shows the progression of how the Nazis over a period of time, once they took control and power, began to take away the rights of individuals and little by little discriminate and deal with them in such a way that they were no longer even treated as human beings."
The little yellow stars of David having to be worn on the clothing of the children was one of the first steps.
"As we walked through, we saw the progression as it got worse from simply the isolation and identification to the point of persecution, severe persecution."
"And I remember when we got to the point of the exhibit at Yad Vashem that depicted what happened in Warsaw, Poland, when the Nazis would come in the middle of the night to take the Jewish parents away on the trains to the death camps, leaving the children sometimes in the street to fend for themselves, 5 and 6-year-old kids with no place to go, no home, no mom, no dad."
The only heat they had was from the grates of the city on the sidewalks.
The only food they would get would be the scraps of food tossed from the upper windows from sympathetic Polish families.
"Sometimes the kids would be actually used as target practice, and the Nazi soldiers would shoot them in the streets just to see what it was like to kill someone."
"As the photographs taken by Nazi soldiers were depicted on the wall, I could feel my daughter's grip getting stronger in my hand, and I realized it was getting through to her.She became incredibly quiet."
"We didn't speak at all through the exhibit, but continued walking and watching, seeing these horrors."
"I remember seeing the pictures of Dachau, thousands of human bodies stacked on top of each other, the emaciated bodies of these dear people, like pieces of lumber."
"No dignity, no respect given to them at all."
"And I think my daughter thought, ""How could anyone do this to another human being?"""
"As we came to the end of the exhibit, there was a guest book and she walked over to it."
"As I stood behind her, she reached up in my pocket, pulled out a pen and started signing the guest book with her name and address."
"Underneath the place for all of that, there was a spot for comments."
My daughter paused and then she wrote something I'll never forget.
"In her childish 11-year-old scrawl, she wrote something that touched me and made me realize she got it.She understood."
"Maybe she would understand why it is that her parents would do something as crazy as leave the comfort of a nice job, good salary, good friends, nice neighborhood and venture into something as volatile as running for public office."
I tell you this because some of you have gone through the same struggle with yourselves and your families.
"But if I had any doubts about whether it was worth it and whether my daughter understood it, they were erased as I looked over her shoulder and watched her write words that will forever be etched in my mind."
The words she wrote were simple.
"They were these: ""Why didn't somebody do something?""That's all she wrote."
"""Why didn't somebody do something?"""
"And, my friends, I come to you today and I ask that when we look at the state of our education, when we look at kids out there whose fathers abuse them, whose mothers neglect them, whose hopes have been crushed by poor health, by neglect, by abuse, when people have been treated wrongly, I don't ever want it to be that some day someone would tour a museum dedicated to America and would have to explain to their child what happened and think that a child would write, ""Why didn't somebody do something?""Why did we come here?I can't answer for you."
There are 134 different stories sitting out here at these desks today.Yours is special and unique.
But I believe every one of you came with a purpose and a mission and a conviction.
"You're the somebodies, and now we have to do the something."
May God help us to do it before it's too late.God bless you.God bless Arkansas.
Let's build a state we are all wonderfully proud of.Thank you very much.(applause.
