SENTENCES
Thank you all.
It is good to have you back in Pierre.
"Before I begin today, I’d like to note a historical milestone."
"Today is the beginning of Lt. Governor Matt Michels’ seventh regular session as President of the Senate, andprior to that, he presidedfor four sessions as Speaker of the House."
Those 11 sessions make Matt Michels the longest-serving presiding officer in the history of the South Dakota State Legislature.
Let’s recognize and thank him for that service.
"Over the past six years, we have undertaken many significant initiatives together and have made progress in many areas."
"Today I am going toprovideupdates on many of our efforts, in the areas of education, transportation, criminal justice, workforce, and tribal affairs,among others."
"I want to update you on our accomplishments and, also in some cases, talk about adjustments that we can make to continue to improve."
"STATE REVENUESFirst,a brief update on our state revenue situation."
"I have some good news, and I have some bad news.I’ll start with the bad news."
"Since we met in December, revenue has not strengthened."
Sales tax continues to run below even revised projections.
Overall revenue isdown another $5.8 million.
We will need to continue to watch revenues over the next two months to ensurewe adopt a structurally balanced budget in March.
"We all know that the farm economy is one reason for weakness in the sales tax, and another reason is the continued growth inonline sales."
Many online retailers do not collect and remitsales tax.
"As you know, the state has taken several steps over the years to try to collectmore of that tax."
"After last session, the Department of Revenue reached out to many online retailers to encourage them to remit tax.And that’s the good news."
"Today, I am pleased to announce that the state has reached an agreement with Amazon to collect and remit state and local sales taxesin South Dakota."
Amazonwill begin voluntarily to collect sales taxeson February 1 and will remit beginning in late March.
"Amazon, as you know,is a leading online merchant, growing every year by double digits."
"Theirdecision to collect sales tax doesn’t solve the sales tax issuefor online purchases, but it’sa big step in the right direction."
Eileen Sullivan is here today representing Amazon.
"For theirdecision as a good corporate citizen to join the many South Dakota retailers who collect and remit the sales tax, I’d ask her to standso that we can thank her."
"BETTER GOVERNMENT INITIATIVEIn past years, I’ve talkedabout a“Better Government Initiative” –a constant effort to make state government more efficient, more open, and accessible."
"We’ve made goodstrides over the past six years, and I’llbe asking you to help us furtherimprove this year."
"First, we continueto work on “red tape repeal” efforts."
"Over the past six years, we have proposed and you have passed a repeal of over 4,000 sections of obsolete or unnecessary lawsand rules, accounting for nearly 470,000 words."
We will be proposing more of these bills this year.
"Another important component of Better Government is to be more open, accountable, and accessible."
"I have made this a priority,and we have made considerable progress."
We recently launched an online pardon application site –making South Dakota the first state in the nation with a completely online pardon application process.
"This year, I will also be supporting the attorney general’s proposalto make booking photographs, also known asmugshots,open to the public, as in most states."
"Last year, I asked Lt. Governor Michels to lead an effort to improve our state’s internal controls."
"You passed legislation creating the Board of Internal Controls, and that body has been meeting monthly since May."
Internal controls within state government itselfare already strong.
"In fact,we just completedourComprehensive Annual Financial Report for FY16 –the earliest completionin 20 years –withan “unqualified” cleanaudit from the Department of Legislative Audit."
But we mustdo a better jobofmonitoring federal fundsthat pass through the state to non-state entities.
"This is a complex area,but the board is working hard to establish these standards."
One important aspect of internal controls is avoidingconflicts of interest.
Most conflicts of interest are innocent and can be avoided through education.
"Two years ago, you passed,and I signed legislation creating new conflict of interest standards for state employees, and that system is working well."
"We now have a system that makes state employees more aware of potential conflicts, so they can be preventedor publicly disclosed and identifiedas not against public interest."
"Last year, I signed similar legislation for state boardand commission membersand for local school board members."
"After one year’s experience, I will support legislation this year to clarify and streamline that law so that boards can achieve our objective of bringing transparency to these situations."
"Over the past six years, we have taken many steps to make state government information more accessible."
We have put economic development grants online.
We have put restaurant inspections online.
"Information on oil, gas, and water drilling isnowonline.Open.SD."
"gov has been completely redesigned and is a central hub for information including grants and contracts, payroll information,and checkbook-level detail on vender payments."
The State Legislature itself hasbeen a leader in this area.
"It was twenty years ago that the legislature launched itsexcellent website that allows for online tracking of legislation and live and archived internet streaming ofall legislative meetings.In the Executive Branch,Rules.SD."
gov allows citizens to track and comment upon proposed rules.
"Two years ago, we also launched a portal to centralize information on state boards and commissions in one place –membership information, agendas, meeting materials, minutes, financial reports, and audits."
"This year, I will ask you to support legislation to institutionalize the Boards and Commissions portal."
"Today, I can require state agencies to utilize this site, but I want the law to require it after I’m gone."
"This site only works if boards are required to posttheir information online, just as we require them in law to post their public notices at the locationwhere a meeting is held."
We are alsomakingstate board and commissionmeetingsaccessible with internet streaming.
South Dakota Public Broadcasting recently launched SD.
"net which is aone-stop website to stream legislative proceedings and board and commission meetings, as well asother Public Broadcastingcoverage such as high school state tournaments."
All of these efforts have paid off.
"In 2011, shortly after I took office, South Dakota received a D+ for online access to government financial data from the Public Interest Research Group."
"As of the2016 report, South Dakota has improved that score to an A-."
One reliableadvocate for openness over the yearshas been news reporter Bob Mercer.
"Of course, as a reporter, Bob has written about the need for openness."
"But when he has seen opportunities to improve, he’s also shared them with my office, and I always appreciated that."
"Several of theseimprovements were Bob’s suggestions, including the Rules website, the expansion of the Boards and Commissions portal, and even the caseoutside the Capitol Building for posting notices."
"Bob is confronting some health challenges, asyou may know, and he will not be here this year to cover the legislative session."
"But I hope we all will keep Bob and his family in our thoughts, aswe continue these efforts toward openness."
"FISCAL MANAGEMENTSince I spoke to you last yearat this time, I’m very proud that South Dakota has now obtained AAA ratings –the highest possible –from all three major credit rating agencies."
One reason for our AAA rating is the breadth of financial information that wecompileand make available online.
"Transparency is important in its own right, but it also has a positive financialimpact."
"The AAA rating saves moneywhen our tech schools, universities, and hospitalsissue bonds –we get a lowerinterest rate because of our bond rating."
"Two years ago, at the behest of the lieutenant governor, you passed legislation that also allows school districts to benefit."
Districts borrowingthrough the Health and EdAuthoritycan now leverage our creditrating.
"Since this began, at least eight school districts have realizedsavings.Redfield saved $185,000.Meade County saved $150,000."
The Oglala Lakota School District was able to refinance a 2013 debt and saved$3 million.
Our AAA rating is the consequence of the many sound financial decisions that governors and legislatorshave made over the years.
We have balanced our budget for 128 years and recentlyplaced an explicitrequirement for a balanced budget in theconstitution.
"We’ve made it the norm to have a structurally balanced budget, which supportsongoing expenses with ongoing revenuesonly."
We have built and maintained a rainy-day fund that is ten percent of our general fund budget.
"We have been conservative in estimating revenues and expenses, and when we have one-time money to spend, we have prudentlyused it to repaydebtearly, secure an existingasset, endow an ongoing asset, or create a new asset."
And we can all be veryproud of the management of the South Dakota Retirement System.
The plan is well funded and routinely ratesas one of thestrongest in the nation.That is no accident.
"Over the past few years, the retirement system trustees have proposed, and you have passed, several important adjustments to the plan that have strengthened it for the long-term."
"This year, the trustees arebringing another bill that will protect the plan from swings in inflation or investment returns, and I hope you will support that also."
STEWARDSHIP OF STATE ASSETSSound management also involves the stewardship of tangible state assets.
Regular maintenance of state-owned facilities prevents larger problems in the future.
But we also need to constantly reevaluate our need for the facilities that we have.
"When I first ran for governor, I talked about the need to scrutinize state-owned landand buildingsand to sell assets that were underutilized."
This has been an ongoing process now for six years.
"We first addressed the Human Services Center in Yankton, and with your support, we sold unneeded land and demolished manyvacantanddilapidated buildings."
We also negotiated a lease-purchase with the Yankton County Historical Society for the historic Mead Building.
"Ifyou haven’t seen it, this building is being beautifullyrestored."
"Next, we looked at the campus of the South Dakota DevelopmentalCenter in Redfield."
"Like the Yanktonfacility, this large campus was built to houseover a thousand South Dakotanswith developmental or mental health issues, often for their entire lives."
"Today, the campus serves only about 125 persons."
"This year, I will be askingyouto authorize the transferof several vacant buildings and the adjoining lands from that campus to the city of Redfield, whichhas expressed an interest in refurbishing the buildings and returning them to a public use."
We are also discussing apotential sale of the former State Training School campus in Plankinton.
This property has been leased for over a decade to a private companythat operates the Aurora Plains Academy there.
"We are consideringthe potential to sell the campus, andI will be asking you to authorize that potential sale as well."
"I am also asking you to approve the potential sale of the STAR Academy property,outside of Custer, which closed last March."
There are too fewjuveniles in the corrections system to justifythis large campus.
"Even afuture increase ofjuveniles incorrectionswould not justify reopeningSTAR Academy –we would use smaller, more efficient facilities closer to population centers."
"My hope is that the STAR Academy property, which is ata scenic Black Hills location, can be sold and developed to create jobs and economic activity in the area."
"The construction of thenew State Veterans Home in Hot Springs has also led us to reevaluate the land and buildings, and I will be asking you to approve legislation that allows us to explore repurposing portions of that campus."
"Likewise, a building formerly used by Western Dakota Techin Rapid City will be reverting to state ownership."
"The state has no use for this building, and I will be asking you to authorize its saleas well."
"I also hope to continue to discuss with the Board of Regents the former School for the Deaf buildingsandproperty, located on East 10thStreet in Sioux Falls."
"We owe it to taxpayers to keep the state’s footprint to a minimum, to avoid spending taxdollars onmaintenance ofunneeded facilities and to return these properties to the tax rolls when possible."
INFRASTRUCTUREOf course state infrastructure is not confined to buildings.
"We also have transportation infrastructure, and over the past six years, we have made great progress in this areaas well."
We have refurbished two significant stretches of state-owned rail line.
"In 2014, you appropriated $7.2 million in general funds to upgrade the state-owned line from Chamberlain to Presho."
We also provided grants from the Future Fund and the state rail fundand received a federal TIGER grant.
"Because of this upgrade, Wheat Growers constructed a $50 million grain handling facility in Kennebec, which was completed this fall."
"In addition, we upgraded the Britton line, aided by a Future Fund grant and a loan from the state rail fund."
This line runs from Aberdeen into North Dakotaand connects shippers to both the Canadian Pacific Rail line and the Burlington Northernline.
"As a result of this upgrade, the Wheaton-Dumont Elevator and United Grain Corporationbuilt a $40 million dollar state-of-the-artfacilityon the Brittonspur."
Thatfacility opened this fall and is shipping grain today.
"Both of these upgrades have created more shipping and selling options for farmers, created jobs in rural areas, and added significant grain handling facilities to the property tax rolls."
We are also making major investmentsin our highways.
One exampleisHighway100 inSioux Falls.
A majorphase of this multi-year project will let bids this summer to connect this new urban corridorto I-90 west of Brandon.
That phaseof the project should be completed by2019.
We have also provided aid tolocal governmentinfrastructure.
"Two years ago, we created the Bridge Improvement Grant Fund, which is now granting millionseach year to reduce the backlog of necessary repairs to local bridges."
"As still another piece of state infrastructure, I spoke last month about theneed to replace the state Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory atSDSU."
"Even ina lean budget year, I am hopeful we cansecure for the long-term our animal health laboratory, which protects our citizens and our livestock industry."
"BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCEBeyond our tangibleinfrastructure, a critical duty of our state is to provide asystem of K-12 education."
"To be effective, we need to recruit and retain good teachers, and we compete with neighboring states to do that."
"Last year, we passed major legislationto increase teacher pay and rewrite the school funding formula."
"We are already seeing success from those changes.First, on teacher pay."
"As you know, when the Blue Ribbon Task Force met, our average teacher salary was just over $40,000."
"Our new formula was designed and funded to affordan average of $48,500."
"We knew we wouldn’treach that average in one year, because schools need time to become more efficient and repurpose their own funds into salaries."
"Still, according to the preliminary schoolreports, our average salary this fall is $46,937 –just short of $47,000."
The state’s average salary increased by 11.9 percent.
"Our smaller, rural districts are especially challenged to attract teachers, so I was particularly pleased that preliminary data shows very sizable salary increases in many small districts."
"In Jones County, the average teacher salary increased by 22percent."
"In Ethan, it increased by 20percent."
"In Mobridge-Pollock, salaries are up25percent; inFaith,up 18percent;Iroquois,up 23percent;Florence,up 20percent; Burke,up19percent; OelrichsandGayville-Volinboth up 21 percent, and the highest increase in South Dakota, as a percentage, was Waubay, whose average is up26.3 percent."
"Larger schools also enjoyed sizable raises, although they had higher salaries to begin with,and therefore,their percentage increases are generally lower."
I have already heard from many superintendents that these changesare having an impact.
"Fewer teachers are departing, fewer vacancies are left unfilled, positions are getting more applicants,and more teachers are staying in South Dakota rather than leaving the state."
"I know some have expressed concern about the new formula’simpact on small schools, because the new formula calculates state aid based on actual number of enrolled students."
"In other words, it no longerallowsa school with declining enrollments to receive funding based onthe higher enrollments ofpast years."
"Even withthatchange, however, the new formula wasactually more favorable to small schools than it was to larger ones."
"Statewide,schools received an average increase of $526 per student."
Large schools of over 600 students received only $507 moreper student.
"Schools between 200 and 600 studentsreceived $579 more per student, and schools of under 200 students did best of all–they received $653 more per student."
"Again, those numbers are afterthe change toactual fall enrollments for calculating state aid."
K-12 EDUCATIONThestate aid formula is not the only way that the state directly supports K-12 education.
Our successful Dual Credit program for high school students is now in its third year.
"As I’ve said before, this dual credit program is a win-win-win."
"Students win because these are the cheapest college credits they will ever buy, and theyget a head start on college or tech school."
High schools win because theycanexpand their course offerings at no cost to the school district.
"Universities and technical instituteswin, because they attract students who are better-prepared when they come to campus."
"In the past school year, 2,139 high school students took at least one dual credit course from a university, and another 899 took a technical institute course."
Thepassage rate is excellent –94 percent for university courses and 88 percentfor technical institute courses.
And the cost savings are substantial.
"Last year, high school students and their families saved a total of $4.4 million,compared to the tuition rate they would otherwisepaid."
"As you can tell, I’m very enthusiastic about the success of the dual credit program."
"Unfortunately, the state offers another program to high schools that has not been so successful, and I’d like to touch on that."
One persistent problem in South Dakota is the number of high school graduates who go on to college butneed remedial courses.
"Last year, 30percentof first-year, full-time freshman at state universities needed to take at least one remedial course in math or English."
"Unlikedual credit, remedial courses are a lose-lose."
"Students lose because remedial courses are expensive, and they don’t count for credit, so they set a student back in theircollegecareer."
"Universities also lose, because students who need remediation are less likely to stay in school and graduate on time."
"To address this problem, four years ago, I proposed and the legislaturefunded the Accuplacer assessment for high schools."
This is a free service provided by the state to high schools.
Hereis how it works: Ahigh school junior with a poor ACT score takes the Accuplacer test in math and English.
The test identifies anyareain which the student needs remediation.
It might not be all math –it might be just a specific concept.
The studentis then offered remedial coursework on just that conceptwhile the student is still in high school.
"If the student is able to pass the test after taking the coursework, the state universities will not require the student to take a remedial course."
"It’s a great deal for these students–it saves them the cost of a college remedial course, and avoids thatdelay when they get to college."
"And the state pays it, we pay for the entire cost of every completed Accuplacer course."
"Given that, I’m very frustratedthat our high schools have been extremely slow to adopt this free program."
"Last school year, only 154 Accuplacer assessments were taken,and only 100 final tests were taken statewide."
Most students who needed this Accuplacer assessment didn’t take it.And how do we knowthat?
"Because this past fall, at our state universities, 599 remedial courses were required for new freshmen from South Dakota high schools."
"That’s 599remedial courses at about $1000 each, totaling overhalf a million dollarsin expense."
"Moneyour students paid, when the state has a free program not being used."
"We have 150 school districtsin South Dakota, but 108 of them didn’t offer this to a single student."
"Now in August,I spoke atthe school administrator convention,and I asked them to take advantage of this program, and I am hoping we’ll see much greater use this school year."
"I have heard it suggested in the past that, if a high school graduateneeds remediation in college, it should be the high school, not the student, who pays the remediation bill."
"I’m not proposing that today, but I certainly hope high schools will take advantage of the free courses we offer to help their students avoid remediation."
"On another front, the state is strengtheningcareer and technical education programs."
"In 2016, the Building SouthDakota Fund awarded the first workforce education grants to help transform high schoolCTE programs."
"Examples of initial grants include a new auto mechanic program at Gayville-Volin, a precision ag program at Hitchcock-Tulare,andanursing program in Mitchell."
"HIGHER EDUCATIONAt the technical institutes, the Build Dakota Scholarship is in its second year, and I am excited about the results we’re seeing."
"As you know, this scholarship with launched with $25 million fromDenny Sanfordandanother $25 million in state Future Funds."
"Approximately 300 students each year receive full-ride scholarships to attend a technical institute in a high-need program, promisingto work in that field in South Dakota after they graduate."
"Nationally,over the past two years, enrollment in two-year institutions is down nearly 17 percent."
"In South Dakota, we’ve bucked that trend; our statewide enrollment isdown only 1 percent."
"In Build Dakota programs,though, enrollment is up nearly 10 percent."
I’m excited about the impact these Build Dakota scholarshipswill have on our workforce when the first recipients receive their two-year degrees in May.
"Voters showed their support forour technical institutes in the general election by passing Amendment R. This amendment solved a longstanding constitutional problemby giving the legislature authority to provide for the oversight of the technical institutes, and I will support legislation this year that implements Amendment R. Of course, we are also very proud of our six state universities who do so much to prepare our young people to enter the workforce."
I am particularly pleased that the Regents hastaken a leadership role in adoptinga goal that 65 percentof South Dakota high school graduates go on to graduate from a university or technical school.
"Mostjobs ofthe future will require a post-high school credential,and we need to encourage students to obtain one."
"We especially needhealth careworkers, particularly in rural areas, and we continue to pursue programs to address that need."
"The Recruitment Assistance Program helpscommunities recruit primary care doctors, dentists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners."
"Fifty-eight percent of physicians and dentists, and 88 percent of physician assistants and nurse practitioners remain at their small-town site even after completing their contract commitment."
"Likewise, each year we placein rural communities 60 otherhealthprofessionals,includingdietitians, nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists."
We also launched the Frontier and Rural Medicine program to give third-year medical students ninemonths ofclinical training in rural communities.
"The first suchstudents graduated from medschool last May, and five of them moved into a family practice residency program."
CRIMINAL JUSTICEI’d like to take a little time now to talk about criminal justice.
"In 2012, we began to confront South Dakota’s incarceration rate, which was much higher than our neighboring states’."
"I joined with the Chief Justice, legislative leaders, and key stakeholders to propose the Public Safety Improvement Act, which you passed overwhelmingly in 2013."
"The goals of this legislationare to improve public safety, hold offenders more accountable, and direct state dollars to the most dangerous offenders."
This act differentiated our drug laws so that major offenses would be treated more harshly thanminor offenses.
"It created and expanded alternative sentencing options, such as drug and DUI courts,and HOPE probation."
And it made the largest investment in the history of our state in behavioral health services.
"We knew these were major changes, and that’swhy the Act also created an oversight council to monitor progress, identify problems, and recommend changes."
"Reforms needtime to work, but we shouldn’tbe afraid to adjust as we learn more andas circumstances change."
"Four years later, we are seeing many positive developments from the Public Safety Improvement Act."
Among the successes is probation.
"Under the old system, we were supervising for multiple years many probationers who never reoffended."
"We did this in spite ofdata which showsthat if a probationer is going to reoffend, it is very likely to be in thefirst year ofprobation."
"For that reason, we now allow felony probationers to reducetheir probation term by 30 days, each time they complete 30 days of perfect behavior."
This reform allows our probation officers to focus their attention on supervising those probationers who need it –those who are not compliant.
"The Act also created a presumption of probation for many low-level, non-violent crimes."
This doesn’t tie the hands of a judge who wantsto sentence an offender to prison.
"A judge canoverride the presumption, nor does this compromise public safety."
Last yearless thanone percent of those onpresumptive probation were sent to prison for committing a violent crime.
I am also very pleased with the success of the substance abuse treatment programs created under theAct.
"Five-hundred-forty individuals have completed substance abuse treatment, and our rate of successful completion is 11percent higher than the national average."
"Because of thesereforms, more offenders are receiving the help they need through community-based treatment."
The Act also initiated a very successful partnership with the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate.
"We placed a state-funded parole agent at Sisseton, which allows tribal members to return home for parole and engages local service providers and tribal law enforcement in providing support for the offenders to change, and the results are compelling."
"In the first two years of this program, the percentage of tribalparolees beingreturned to prison for a violation has fallen from 57percentto 28percent –cut in half."
"Again, these efforts help focus our attention on violent offenderswho pose a threat to public."
Nonviolentoffenders receive treatment and remainin their communities where they can work to supportthemselves and their families.
"METH EPIDEMICThese are importantaccomplishments, but there is still work to be done."
"The total prison population today is lower than it would have been without any reforms, but it is higher than we predicted it would be when we passed the Public Safety Improvement Act.Why is that?"
"Well we believe it’s due to the increase in methamphetaminetrafficking, which in South Dakota and our neighboring states have experienced over the past eight years."
"Like our neighbors, South Dakota is seeing a big increase in meth-related arrests and convictions."
"For the most part, meth is no longer being a manufactured in home-grown laboratories."
It is being producedon an industrial scale and trafficked into South Dakota from outside our state.
"This meth epidemic needs to be addressed, and we need to make adjustments to the Public Safety Improvement Act because of it."
"Last year, I invited a group of judges and court officials, law enforcementofficers, prosecutors,defense attorneys, corrections officials, and legislatorsto look into the meth problem and make recommendations."
"That group issued recommendations towardthree important goals: First, we need to stop meth from cominginto South Dakota."
"Second, we need to educate people, especially young people, to prevent use of meth."
"Third, we need to help those addicted to stop usingmeth."
It is in everyone’s interest to help them beat this addiction.
"Based on that report, I am joining with the attorney general to propose a joint drug interdiction task force, comprisedof four new Highway Patrol officers, joined by designated agents of the Division of Criminal Investigation."
We will also be asking you to update the state’s outdated wiretapping statute to include cellular phones.
There is a very close correlation between the increase in drug trafficking and the increase in meth arrests and convictions in South Dakota.
We need to stop meth from coming intoSouth Dakota.
"TheAttorney Generaland the Department of Social Services are also both focused on educating young people about meth, and a legislative interim committee also consideredthis issuelast year."
"Starting this year, the managers of state anti-meth programs will meetregularly to coordinate these effortsand maximize their impact."
"We need to convince our citizens, again especially our youth, to stay away from meth."
"Finally, I’m proposing changes to the Public Safety Improvement Act toencourage treatment and more directly confront the meth problem."
"For those who are on probation or parole, I am proposing measures to reinforce good behavior and punish bad behavior."
We will establisha shortmandatorysanction of required confinementfor anyoneon probation or parolewho fails a drug test.
This will guaranteeswift and certain sanctions for offenders who choose to use drugs.
"Conversely, we will allow supervision to be terminated early for parolees and probationers who stay clean, complete treatment, and don’t violate the terms of their supervision for at least oneyear."
"To help those who are already addictedto meth, I am proposing we incentivize effectivecompletion of treatment."
Offenders who complete all court-ordered treatmentwithin one year will be givenone opportunity to reduce a drug possession or ingestion charge from a felony to a Class 1 misdemeanor.
This option would only be available oncefor each offender.
I am also recommending grants to expand HOPE 24/7 Probation to all counties.
HOPE 24/7 is similar to the successful 24/7 program for alcohol offenders.
"HOPE 24/7has been implemented in ten counties and provides intensive probation and treatment for serious drug offenders, who are required to take random drug tests to ensure that they stay clean."
"These stepsI believewillstrengthen the state’s response to the meth epidemic, while helping meth users beat their addiction."
Meth is an extremely addictive drug that ruins homes and destroys lives.
"Trying meth just once can lead to death,and itchanges brainfunctions."
"Meth users experience paranoia, delusions, severe tooth decay,and skin sores."
The reforms I describedhavethepotential to help those usersand endthe vicious cycle of drug abusewithin families.
"JUVENILE JUSTICETwo years ago, we recognized that South Dakotawas locking up juveniles at the 2ndhighest rate in the nation.Most were nonviolent."
You joined me in passing reformsto the juvenile justice system.
"The statutory purpose of our juvenile justice system is rehabilitation, and locking up youth has been shown to make them morelikely to commit crimes as adults."
We need to avoid locking up young people unless they are a danger to others.
The reforms invested $6.1 millionin expandedcommunity-based treatment.
"Functional family therapy focuses on the family, as well as the young person, to address underlying family issues that often cause delinquency."
"More than 50 trained treatment clinicians travel to the homeandprovide treatment in rural areas, not just in larger towns."
"Last year, nearly 700 young people were served through this treatment, including 250 who were referred from outside of the criminal justice system."
"Feweryoung offenders who needed to be housed in an institution led to the closure last year of STAR Academy, asI mentioned earlier."
"Instead, we are making greater use of our community-based facilities and providers and focusing more on rehabilitation."
One aspect of the reforms that has been troublesome is the issue of truancy.
We all know that keeping young people in school is vital to their long-term success.
The reform legislation changed the truancy statuteto allowschools to intervene with a citation earlier in the process.
But some schools and counties felt that the new law made it difficult for them to deal with these issues.
The Juvenile Justice Oversight Council sought input from schools and will be proposing legislation this year to give state’s attorneys greater flexibilityin handling truancy cases.
"I support that change, and asI said a moment ago, we need to adjust as we learn more."
"MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCEThis past year, Chief Justice Gilbertson convened a task force to address issues in the criminal justice system relating to mental health."
"Court orders for competency evaluations had tripled in recent years, contributing to the backlog of evaluations and causing higher costs."
"In some cases, mentally ill individuals had to wait in jail several months for their competency evaluations to be completed."
"That’s not fair to the individual, and it creates an unnecessary jail expense for the county."
"Funded by a grant from theHelmsley Charitable Trust, thetask force released its reportin November."
"Among its findings, itrecognizedthat our system lacks procedures to identify mental illness quickly after an arrest, and in many cases,jailsare not equipped to deal with mental health needs."
"In some cases, diversion options that are already authorized by statuteare not available in all areas of the state."
"I will be supporting the task force’s recommendations, which takes a multi-faceted approach to these problems."
The legislation will provide law enforcement with toolsto better identify and respond to mental health crises and prevent unnecessary jail admissions and to assist communities in building capacity to offer crisis interventionservices.
The bill will also expand the pool of providers who can provide competency evaluations and will shift funding from theHuman Services Center directly to counties to perform these evaluations.
"Much like our adult and juvenile reformpatterns, anoversight council will monitor implementation and recommend changes to future legislatures."
I thank the Chief Justice and task force members for studying this difficult issue and for offering common sense proposals to improve our system.
I also thank the Helmsley Charitable Trust for its financial support.
"TRIBAL RELATIONSLast year,Chairman Harold Frazier ofthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribegave the first-ever State of the Tribes Address in this chamber."
It gave this body and South Dakotans a chance to hear about the challenges facing Indian Countryfrom the perspective of an elected tribal leader.
"I look forward to Thursday’s 2017 State of the Tribes Address from Chairman Robert Flying Hawk of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, and I hope this continues asan annual tradition."
"Relations between the tribes and the state made continued progress in 2016, thanks in large part to the efforts of Tribal Relations Secretary Steve Emery and his staff."
I mentioned a few moments ago the successful parole agreement we have undertaken with the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate.
Let me give you a few more examples.
"Last year,the state reached new tax collection agreements with the Crow Creek Sioux, Oglala Sioux, and Sisseton-Wahpeton tribes, and we are in discussions with the Lower Brule Sioux."
These agreements generate tax revenue for the tribes and promote uniformity and fairness in taxation.
"If discussions with the Lower Brule are successful, we will have agreements with all nine tribes, for the first time in South Dakotahistory."
"We also extended or signed tribal gaming compacts last year with the Crow Creek Sioux, Flandreau Santee Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, and Yankton Sioux tribes."
"In some renegotiated compacts, tribes have committed financial assistance to local governments."
"This, too, is something new, a welcome addition for several counties."
"Game, Fish,and Parks has partnered with tribal governments to improve management and conservation of shared natural resources."
"Game, Fish, and Parkshas hosted training sessions for tribal conservation staff, aided with establishing deer and elk food plots, and provided equipment and staff for outdoor events."
"This year, GFP signed memorandums of understanding to formalize cooperation with the Rosebud Sioux and the Lower Brule Sioux tribes."
"In the educationrealm, the Department of Education is working with the Commission for Oceti Sakowin Accreditation to allowthe Commission to accredit non-public tribal schools."
The Commission is nine tribecollaboration focused on ensuring cultural relevance in tribal schools.
"On September 17, we celebrated the dedication of a new South Dakota landmark –“Dignity."
"Located near Chamberlain at the rest areaon Interstate 90, Dignity is a 45-foot tall stainless steel sculpture of a Native American woman receiving a star quilt."
It was created by South Dakota Artist Laureate Dale Lamphere.
Norm and Eunabel McKie of Rapid City donated the sculpture as a giftto honor the heritage of our Native people.
National headlines often emphasize our divisions.
"But seeing Dignityand recounting the progress made in tribal-state relations this yearreminds usthat, in South Dakota, we have more in common than we sometimes realize."
"The important thing, even wherewe may differ, is totreat each otherwith dignity."
"LONG TERM CAREThis week,I will signan executive order for your consideration to reorganizelong term care services within state government, by creating a Division of Long Term Services and Supports within the Department of Human Services."
The purpose of the reorganization is to create a more integrated approach to the delivery of long term carein South Dakotaand to ensure that people get the services they need in their communities.
"Our state will experience demographic changes in the coming years,which will require more long term services and supports."
"In 2035, it’s estimated the number of elders will increase in SouthDakota by 84percent,compared to 2010."
"Hopefully,I will still be around, andamongthem!"
The number of elders with disabilities is expected to be71percenthigher.
"Today, the Department of Human Services assists those with developmental disabilities who require long term care, and the Department of Social Services provides that same assistance to those who are aging."
We have two different departments providing a very similar service.
"Combining these services in one department will ensure that people can access long term care, regardless of why they need it."
"The reorganized agency will also redouble effortsto develop community based services in our stateto provide care, in homes, or other environments less restrictive, and less expensive than nursing home placements."
"BALLOT MEASURESLast month in the budget address, I spokeabout Initiated Measure 22."
"Since then, that law has been enjoined due to numerous constitutional problems."
"Given that, I will support efforts this session to repeal Initiated Measure22 and replaceit with provisionsthat are well-crafted, constitutional, and responsive to the voters."
"The voters expect our campaign finance system to be transparentand honest,and they expect lobbyists to use only their arguments to win our votes."
The proliferation of complex measures crowding our ballotsthrough the efforts of people who don’t live in South Dakota is a concern to many.
We need tofind a way to stop out-of-state organizationsfrom experimenting with South Dakota’s constitution and laws.
These groups have no ties to our state and often don’t even disclose the source of their funds.
They are usingour state’s low signaturerequirementand cheap media markets to attempt to pass constitutional amendments and initiated measures that advancetheir nationalagendasbut don’t address problems seen in South Dakota.It's ironic.
South Dakota was the first state in the nation to create theinitiative and referendum.
"In 1898, voters adopted these features of our constitutionbecause ofa fear that big money,out-of-state special interests would take overthe state legislature."
"Now, 120 years later, we find big out-of-state money is taking over our ballot."
They usethe initiative process –the very process we created to protect ourselves fromthem.
"This session, we need to work together to find a way to protect our state from interference by out-of-state groups, while preservingour citizens’ access todirect democracy, so issues that do concern our grassroots can be raised, but not by people who don’t even live here."
"RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPSSpeaking of another kind of grassroots, I am introducing a bill this year to provide property tax incentives for riparian buffer strips on agricultural property."
These buffer strips are areas near streams or lakes that have perennial plantings toprotect the water from adjoining land uses.
They improve water quality by filtering sediment and surface contaminants from runoff.
"Last year, you overwhelmingly passed a similar bill thatI vetoed because of constitutional concerns, andI believe the new billovercomesthese concerns, and the legislation I am proposing has received positive support fromag groups, local governments, conservationists, sportsmen, and the Ag Land Assessment Task Force."
I hope you will support it as well.
STATE PARKSAnother important way that our state preserves our outdoors is through our excellent state park system.
"In 2016, more people camped in South Dakota’s state parks than ever before."
"Our parks hosted over 329,000 nights of camping–up 4 percent from 2015, when the 75thSturgis Rally and the 50thBuffalo Roundup were held."
Camping numbers have been increasing for our state parks every year for more than a decade.
"Progress continuesat Good Earth State Park, which you approved in 2013 as South Dakota’s thirteenth state park."
"Construction ofthe new visitor centeris progressing,and the surrounding sidewalks are nearing completion."
The new roadway into the park and parking area arecomplete.
"The visitor center film and interpretive displays,which will tell the story ofthe site’s native inhabitants,are also underway."
"Outside native grasses have been sown, trees planted, and hiking trails developed."
A grand opening of the visitor center is scheduled for May.
We also continue to pursue efforts to create a state park in Spearfish Canyon.
I spoke to you about this last year.
"Our congressional delegation has introduced legislation that authorizes the exchange of 1,992 acres of Black Hills National Forest Land for 1,954 acres of state land, currently held by School and Public Lands, and 34 acres within Spearfish Canyon."
The exchange is a good deal for South Dakota.
It gives the state control of a beautiful area while allowing the federal government to round out some of its grasslands holdings.
It also will increase annual earnings from the School and Public Lands fund to benefitour K-12 schools.
I know there is some concern in the Spearfish area about the long-term plans for this site.
"Game, Fish,and Parks has been meeting with local groups to discuss next steps and will be holding public information meetings to gather feedback and continue the discussion."
"We want public input before any final decisions are made about management of the lands, including potential fee areas or infrastructure improvements."
"SANFORD UNDERGROUND RESEARCH FACILITYJust down the road from Spearfish Canyon is another significant state investment, the Sanford Underground Research Facilityat the former Homestake Gold Mine."
"Progress continues at the lab on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, or DUNE."
"This experiment willfire a beam of neutrinos–tiny subatomic particles –fromFermilab, just outside Chicago,through the Earth to huge underground detectors at the Sanford Lab."
Thirty countries and 161 institutions are now involved with DUNE.
"Rehabilitationof the Ross Shaft, which is necessary to move equipment down into the lab, is 85percentcomplete and on track to be finished in September."
"Last year,theproject received federal approval for early construction."
"In 2017,the lab will beginbuildinga conveyor system to remove rock as massive detector chambers arecreated underground, beginning in2019."
"Although funding for this project is always contingent on the federal budget, our state’s investment in the facility, as well as the continued support of our congressional delegation,haveput us in an unprecedented position to succeed."
"SOUTH DAKOTA NATIONAL GUARDBefore I close today, I want to give tribute tosomething of which we can all be proud –the role the National Guard plays in defending our nation and responding to emergencies here at home."
"Sometimes they are recognized at the national level, and we don’t fully appreciate it here back at home."
"Since 9/11, the South Dakotan National Guard has deployed more than 7,800 soldiers and airmen."
"In 2016, more than 370 soldiers from five South Dakota units supported overseas contingency operations."
"The 155thEngineer Company, 196thManeuver Enhancement Brigade, 153rdEngineer Battalion, 114thFighter Wing, and Detachment 48 all served abroad last year in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Poland."
The soldiers and airmen of the South Dakota National Guard havebeen recognized time and time again for theirexcellence.
"Our National Guard ranks number onein the nation for attrition loss rate, number two in security compliance, number threefor timeliness in soldier evaluations, and number fivefor personnel readiness and soldier management."
"The South Dakota Army National Guard was presented with a first-placegold finish in the 2016 Army Communities of Excellence Awards,and for the thirdconsecutive year, the 153rdEngineer Battalion was awarded the top overall battalion-sized unitin the nation and winner of the Reckord Trophy."
"In 2016, the 114thFighter Wing, likewise, for the third year in a row, was designated a Distinguished Flying Unitas one of the fivebest flying units in the nation."
We have good reason to be proud of our soldiers and airmen.
Please join me in a round of applause tothank them for their efforts.
"MEDICAID AND INDIAN HEALTH SERVICENext week, DonaldTrump will be sworn in as the 45thPresident of the United States."
"Many of us were bracing ourselves for fourmore years of the status quoin WashingtonDC, and Ilook forward toan administration that respects limited government, is committed to reining in the federal bureaucracy, and understands the role of the states in a federal system."
Both the Trump Administration and leaders in Congress have been reaching out to the states asking forways toroll back regulationand return flexibility to the states.
"In my responses, my priority isMedicaid reform."
"Last year,I explained how funding for Medicaid works forNative Americanswho are also eligible for services from the Indian Health Service."
"When a person who is on Medicaid and eligible for Indian Health Servicesgets their health carefrom Indian Health Services, the federal government covers100 percentof the cost."
But when that same person who is Medicaid eligible and Indian Health Serviceseligible can’t get care from Indian Health Services–maybe they don’t live close to an Indian Health Servicesfacility or perhaps Indian Health Servicescan’t provide the type of specialty care the person needs –in that case thefederal government coversonly about half of the bill –not 100 percent.
State taxpayers cover the other half.
Thiscost the state budget almost $93million last year.
The federal government needs to live up to its obligation to provide health care for Native Americans and pay for it no matter where services are provided.
"We saw a federal policy change last year that moved in that direction, but it didn’t gofar enough."
"It requiresnon-IHS and other healthcare providers to jump through several hoops, and without Medicaid expansion there is no way to get them to do that."
The good news is that the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress are both interested in reforming Medicaid to correct longstanding issues with the program.
"I have met with ourcongressional delegation to discuss this, and I will be in Washingtonto discuss Medicaid reformwith the Senate Committeenext weekagain."
"There is also a strong possibility that Medicaid reform efforts could change Medicaid toa per capita or block grant allocation, andIwill advocate for an equitable federal allocation to the state and forthe IHS funding issue to beresolved."
Iwill also ask for more flexibility in the Medicaid program.
"If states are going to be asked to assumemore of the risk, we should also be given more flexibility to innovate and find ways to control costsand improve care."
"AGRICULTUREIn closing today, I want to say a few wordsto the ag community."
"It’s been a tough couple of yearswith depressed crop prices and low livestock prices, the immediate outlook for agriculture doesn’t look very rosy."
"The stateis seeing that reality through slow sales tax growth,but our farmers and ranchersfeel the impact every day."
I remember in highschool when our family farm went upside-down financially.
We had to auctionall our livestock and equipment.
It was a hardday for my parents whotook jobs as janitors at Augustana College to make ends meet.
"Farmers and ranchers arerepeatedlyfaced with difficulty, butour ag sector has survived and prospered for more than a hundred years despitethe risks and despite bad circumstances."
Andwe have reason for continued hope.
South Dakota’s farm and ranch familiesare resilient.
They work hard and they are dedicated.
"When times are tough, they get tougher."
Theypersist and get up every day to put food on their tables and ours.
"We saw thatlast summer, that same persistencefollowing the Cottonwood Fire."
"Afterthe loss of 285 head of cattle and 250 miles of fence line, we saw neighbor helping neighbor."
"When disaster hit, the community truly rallied around the families affected."
Neighbors pitched in to ensurethose who lost pasture and hay had feed for their livestock.
Groups organized “fencing parties” to start the daunting task of repairing and replacing the miles of damaged or destroyed fence.
People from around the state donated fencing materials and hay.
"$125,000 was raised to help families impacted by the fire."
"Whether it’s a flood, blizzard, fire,or windstorm, South Dakotans always pull together when disaster strikes."
"Over Labor Day weekend, Springfield was hit by a severe storm with straight line winds of over 100 mph."
The storm destroyed six homes and damaged a number of others.
"According to early news reports, 70people were displaced by the storm."
The county emergencymanager called the stateDepartment of Public Safety to say the town might need state crews to assist with the response.
What followed wasn’t surprising.
"Of the seventypeoplewithout a place to stay, only two used the Red Cross shelter."
The rest found refuge with relatives and friends.
And then the emergency manager called us back.
"They didn’tneed the state crews after all, because morethan 500 volunteers appearedto assist the community in cleanup efforts."
"OnChristmas Day, when our state was hit with a severe winter storm and many lost power, South Dakotans came togetheryet again."
One man from the northeast part of the state volunteered his own generator to power the homes of several others.
He kept the generator fueled and checked on his neighbors the entire week.
"Another man, one of Whetstone's electricians, learned of an elderly woman using a wood burning stove and found a neighbor to help carry wood and check in on her."
Residents made hot meals for line crews.
A line crew foreman in Enning was snowed in at his house bya 15-foot drift in front of his door.
He climbed out of his bedroom window so he could getto work restoring power.
These stories demonstrate why South Dakota is such a great place to live.
"When disaster strikes, we don’t wait for the government to arrive; we get to work, help ourselves, and help our neighbors too."
We have much to be proud of in South Dakota.
"Our outstandingbusiness climate, low tax burden, clean air, beautiful scenery, safe communities; they all set us apart, and more people are discoveringourhigh quality of life."
"Just last week,in fact,a report by United Van Lines found South Dakota with the highest rate of inbound movesin the country."
We have much to be proud of in South Dakota.
"But, you know, as much as I’m proud of South Dakota, I’mmost proud of South Dakotans."
Yourcharacter and determination give me great confidence in our future.
"I’m verylucky to be Governor of this place, and I do believe ourbest days are yet ahead.Thank youso much."
