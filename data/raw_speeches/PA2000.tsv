Ladies and gentlemen, would you please look to the back of the room for a moment.
That painting you see is of General George Washington's troops training at Valley Forge, exactly 222 years ago this month.
Just two months earlier, Washington's Continental Army had arrived in Valley Forge, ravaged by military defeat.
Much harsher conditions lay ahead.
His troops had little food, ragged clothes and no shelter from the bitter cold and howling winds.
Four days after they arrived, General Washington wrote a letter to the Continental Congress, pleading for provisions.
"He wrote that many of his soldiers were ""unfit for duty, because they are barefoot and otherwise naked."
"If they didn't get assistance soon, he wrote, ""This army must inevitably be reduced to one of these three things: Starve, dissolve, or disperse."
It was, perhaps, the most famous budget request ever made in Pennsylvania.
But it was not just about money.
It was about ensuring the survival of the men who would win a Revolution, making it possible for us to live in the greatest democracy on the face of the earth.
It was about the people behind the numbers.
Today, we unveil our new state budget for the people of Pennsylvania.
Times are very different now.
The economy is strong; the nation and the Commonwealth are at peace.
But, at its core, our budget is still about the people behind the numbers.
We don't provide for soldiers trapped in a bitter outpost - but for students trapped in substandard schools.
We aren't helping an army escape the British - but we're helping thousands of Pennsylvania families escape poverty.
We are not forging a new nation - but we are creating a New Pennsylvania.
With your support, we have made our streets and schools safer, our environment greener, and our tax burden less burdensome.
We've saved Pennsylvania families and businesses $3.4 billion through tax cuts, and kept our state income tax one of the lowest in the nation.
Our unemployment rate has been under five percent for two straight years.
We have made it easier to create jobs - family-sustaining jobs.
And we have brought the state into the high-tech age, from the classroom to the statehouse to our license plates.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have changed the rules.
Under our careful and conservative stewardship, we've cut the growth of government spending nearly in half.
We have lived within our means.
And we have imposed upon ourselves the discipline to save.
On June 30th, our Rainy Day Fund - the state's emergency savings account - will hit $1.1 billion - an all-time record.
It was $66 million when we came to town.
Five years and a billion dollars later, we can now weather a recession without raising taxes or making drastic cuts in services.
We've rejected the old Harrisburg mentality - permanently, I hope -- that said you can spend the state into prosperity, and tax the people into recovery.
This translates into confidence in Pennsylvania.
"For the first time in 30 years, we have received a ""double-A"" bond rating from every major rating agency, saving our taxpayers millions."
"Just this past June, one of those agencies upgraded Pennsylvania's outlook again, based in part on our ""sound financial management."
But we cannot stand still.
With our healthy economy, it is time to give back to the hard-working Pennsylvanians who helped make it that way.
The state will see a budget surplus this year - and, as the saying goes, I didn't hear any taxpayers telling us to keep the change.
So I propose the largest tax cut in Pennsylvania history -- $644 million.
Let's start with our families.
I ask the General Assembly to give a rebate, up to $100, to all Pennsylvania homeowners who pay school district property taxes.
That's $330 million back in our pockets, not government's.
By law, the state does not impose property taxes, and it cannot raise them.
But we can bring some relief.
This year, let's make Harrisburg send you a check.
We also bolster our commitment to working families.
For the fourth year in a row, I propose cutting the income tax on working families who need it most.
Under my plan, a family of four earning $28,000 dollars would pay zero state income taxes - zero - saving them an additional $627 a year.
A family of five would pay zero income tax up to $35,500 -- saving them nearly $1,000.
And a family of six would pay zero income tax up to $43,000 -- giving them a $1,200 tax cut.
Altogether, another 56,000 working families would benefit.
So let's get it done.
Remember this: our families cannot enjoy the fruits of their labor if the fruits have been picked by the tax collector.
Thanks to your help, we've cut Pennsylvania's job-crushing taxes by $3 billion over the past five years.
It's helped to make the Commonwealth one of the top ten states in new corporate expansions.
But we surely cannot be satisfied - not when taxes on our businesses and our workers still remain among the highest in the country - nearly $600 per employee.
Consider the people behind that number.
What do high taxes mean to Pennsylvania?
They mean watching your job or your neighbor's job leave for a more job-friendly state.
And they mean watching our sons and daughters pack their bags to find opportunity in those states.
My friends, Pennsylvania has lost two congressional seats each and every decade since the 60s.
We stand to lose two more after the upcoming national Census.
Our population growth hasn't kept up.
We can't just talk about it - we have to do something about it.
After all, we may have been the first state to put its web site on our license plates - but it won't do any good if the cars they're attached to are headed in the wrong direction.
So we'll begin by cutting the onerous Capital Stock and Franchise tax.
This tax is a two-headed monster, attacking both a company's income and its net worth.
Even if you don't make a profit, you pay!
We've beaten back that monster by cutting it twice in the last three years.
But that's not enough.
Twenty-eight states we compete against don't even have it.
And worse yet, ours is the highest in the nation!
So here's what I propose: first, we cut the tax immediately by a full two mills - a quarter billion dollars in relief.
This year.
Right now.
Second, we eliminate the so-called minimum tax, which hits each and every small business for $200, from the family-owned drycleaners to the woman selling software out of her house.
But even that's not enough.
Not if we're going to be a high-tech leader.
*** Ladies and gentlemen, Pennsylvania has a choice - high-tech or high-tax.
I know which one I want.
And I know which one Pennsylvanians deserve.
The Capital Stock and Franchise tax has taken a huge bite out of D & E Communications and thousands like it over the past 10 years.
Well, turnabout is fair play - over the next 10 years, let's eliminate it, once and for all.
Let's kill the monster.
It's bold.
And it's exactly what we need.
It will send an unmistakable signal to the world that Pennsylvania gets it.
We mean business.
Eliminating the capital stock and franchise tax would be a sure sign that Pennsylvania has become a technology leader.
But not the only sign.
We have accomplished a number of digital firsts and digital bests: The best state government website… The first state to buy goods through an online auction….
The first to pass model digital signature legislation….
The first to create a statewide Digital Technology Atlas….
The first to enable schools to get education grants on-line….
And the first large state to standardize its e-mail system.
Pennsylvania has the third-greatest concentration of high-tech companies in the nation.
"We're home to more than 700 ""dot-com"" companies, including two of the top five business-to-business e-commerce firms in the world."
We've built new partnerships with business, government and our world-class universities.
Take the Digital Greenhouse in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where companies such as Sony, Oki, Cadence, Casio and Cisco are creating the next generation of microchip design technology.
At our Electronic Commerce Center for Excellence in Harrisburg, Microsoft, Dell and UNISYS are helping to educate public officials and corporate leaders on e-commerce.
And with the Lightning Manufacturing initiative, Ingersoll-Rand, Lockheed Martin, IBM and Agile Web will connect e-commerce with factory floors throughout the state.
Our technology trip to California last October produced another major public-private agreement.
Oracle will provide up to $50 million to allow our schools to communicate on a global, state and local level, bringing ideas from around the world to our classrooms.
It's called the Beehive Initiative.
And -- by the way -- we're Oracle's first state partner.
These partnerships may not get the ink of AOL merging with Time Warner, but their impact on the lives of Pennsylvanians will be even greater.
Today I'm pleased to announce one more historic partnership.
Pennsylvania will join forces with Microsoft to build the nation's first statewide Internet portal - right here in the Commonwealth.
Together we will power up Pennsylvania's award-winning website into an even more powerful e-commerce tool.
We call it the PA PowerPort, and it will become part of our everyday lives.
A one-stop shop for the information we all need.
Think about it.
Road maps and weather.
Your own e-mail account.
Local hometown news.
Online Yellow Pages.
Even today's homework assignment for your children's class.
And - just as important -- it will make Pennsylvania employers quicker than their competitors.
Through the PA PowerPort, they'll be able to take their businesses on-line in one week - while it takes their competitors months.
*** Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, Sony, Lucent, SAP -- it's one thing when we say Pennsylvania is a leading technology state.
It's quite another when these leading high-tech CEOs say it.
"And here's another one they'll be talking about: Pennsylvania's ""Friction-Free"" government."
We're investing $20 million in e-government.
We'll use the speed of the Internet not just to help businesses and their customers, but all 12 million Pennsylvanians.
You'll soon be able to register your car and renew your driver's license over the Internet.
Drivers will be on-line, not in line.
Hunters and anglers will be able to get their licenses over the Net - in a matter of minutes, not days.
It will help the more than 2,300 municipalities without an Internet presence get on-line quickly, so constituents can get the best service possible.
We'll also allocate $12 million to expand JNET, our criminal justice communications network -- saving not just time and money but lives.
And we will keep our pledge to post campaign finance reports on the Internet.
Six years after I electronically disclosed my campaign contributions -- the first statewide candidate to do so -- our budget provides funding so that all candidates' reports will be posted on the World Wide Web.
You know, the P. C. sitting on your desk is more powerful than the computers that launched the Apollo rockets to the moon.
But one thing computers haven't learned to do - yet -- is to show up at your door.
To truly be a technology leader, we need a computer behind every Pennsylvania door.
We aren't there yet.
Right now, less than 40 percent of our homes have a personal computer.
My goal is 100 percent.
"I want every home in P-A to have a P. C. To help achieve that I propose a first-of-its-kind ""Tax-Free P. C. holiday - two week-long periods when you'll be able to walk into any computer store in Pennsylvania, buy a P. C. for your home -- and pay zero sales tax."
That's a savings of six percent - a hundred dollars on the average computer purchase.
And computer retailers have told us they will match it with sales of their own.
Three years ago we eliminated the six percent sales tax on computer services.
"Now let's pass the ""Tax-Free P. C. holiday - and make Pennsylvania the Keyboard State."
The first computer sales tax holiday is scheduled for August - back to school time.
It's no coincidence.
Technology is a powerful tool for learning.
That's why we will provide another $15 million for a new Link-to-Learn program to ensure students learn our tough new academic standards while they learn technology.
We also propose to invest $5 million to create the first model Digital School Districts.
Students will be connected to teachers, and teachers connected to parents -- not just within the four walls of a school but throughout the entire community.
Truly, we have evolved as a state -- from a lumbering industrial giant to a nimble technology leader.
But it wasn't that long ago - many of you remember it - that international trade relations in Pennsylvania meant taking turns smacking a foreign car with a baseball bat.
For many years, isolationism was our watchword.
After all, when the bottom dropped out of the domestic steel market, Pennsylvania took the hardest hit.
"As someone born in the ""Steel City,"" I can tell you, the devastation was enormous - and painful."
But we have evolved -- from a state that feared world competition, to one that seeks it out.
During my administration exports have gone up 31 percent to over $20 billion annually - creating 63,000 new jobs.
We've gone to the ends of the earth to make Pennsylvania a job-creation leader - Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, the U. K. We've grown from four trade offices when I became governor to 15.
This year's budget proposes two more - one in Australia, the other in India.
Why does Pennsylvania seek a presence in those two nations?
I can give you over a billion reasons.
*** If we are to be a world leader in technology and job-creation, we must also be a world leader in education.
You can't be one without the other.
So we continue to invest in education.
In the last five years, while inflation has gone up 15 percent, state support of our public schools has gone up by 25 percent.
And we won't stop there.
This year we propose to spend a record $6 billion on our K-12 public schools, an increase of $243 million.
And thanks to the healthy economy, our public schools will save an additional $115 million in retirement costs over last year - equivalent to another three percent increase in the basic education subsidy.
That helps to explain why our schools are able to spend nearly $8,000 per pupil - better than 41 states.
And why our teacher salaries are higher than 44 states'.
Those are the numbers.
They're impressive.
But the money won't matter if we don't spend it on the right priorities.
Behind those incredible numbers are children - some of whom still cannot read.
My first priority is reading.
We propose the most dramatic investment in reading in our state's history -- $123 million.
We start with the second year of the four-year, $100 million Read-to-Succeed program, which has as its premise that our children must read at a third-grade level by the end of the third grade.
Last year, 709 schools received Read-to-Succeed grants totaling more than $34 million - targeted to where the need was greatest.
*** We also continue our historic commitment to make Pennsylvania's libraries second to none.
Our budget invests $80 million in public libraries, a 31 percent increase.
It includes $4 million for ACCESS Pennsylvania, the biggest and best public-school-library database in the nation.
With the new funding we'll add 400 additional elementary school libraries to the catalog.
The third part of our reading emphasis is literacy.
Our budget increases funding for adult- and family-literacy programs by 42 percent, to $18 million.
This new investment will help establish family literacy programs in all 67 Pennsylvania counties.
It will create summer reading programs for parents and children.
If fully implemented, it would mark a 134 percent increase in literacy funding since 1995.
If a child can't read, a child can't learn.
Yet there are 11 school districts in Pennsylvania where half the kids are failing both reading and math.
This despite a per-pupil spending rate that reaches $8,000, $9,000 and even $10,000 per student.
We must not forget the children behind these numbers!
Last year I proposed an Academic Recovery Act to identify our lowest-performing school districts and to give them powerful new tools to turn themselves around.
I'll say that again - tools to turn themselves around.
Those districts would have received broad new powers to hire and fire, to change curriculum, to develop new charter schools, and to contract out for educational services and management.
As a last resort, parents could leave the district.
They could take their child and their tax dollars elsewhere, to the school of their choice.
I might add that unlike the people who vote on choice, and those who fight against it, many of these families don't have the resources to choose the best school for their children.
It is a matter of social and economic justice.
We'll continue to debate school choice.
But we can't allow these children to wait another day for help.
The 250,000 children trapped in those districts are still there.
And they still need and deserve a quality education -- now.
This budget includes $20 million for a new Education Empowerment Act - without the choice component.
We have to help these kids.
There's absolutely no excuse not to act.
Let's pass it by the time school lets out this summer.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Education Empowerment Act is much more than just an education issue.
It hits at the very heart of what it means to be a free society.
Poverty is not intellectually disabling.
These children don't use poverty as an excuse not to learn.
And their poverty shouldn't be used as an excuse not to teach them.
The Education Empowerment Act will help us lift the bar of expectations as high as our kids can reach - and as high as we are willing to teach.
Most school districts are lifting the bar.
They're improving every year.
And they deserve a reward.
This year we double funding for performance-incentive grants for our schools.
$34 million -- equal to another one-percent increase in the basic education subsidy -- will go to those schools that demonstrate outstanding performance and real improvement over the year before.
We expect our schools and students and teachers to perform better every day.
Now, we will reward it like never before.
To learn, our children also must be safe.
This year I propose investing $36 million for our Safe and Alternative Schools program.
This would enable our schools to continue their work to prevent and combat violence, protect teachers and students and place chronically disruptive students in alternative schools.
It's a ten percent increase, and worth every cent.
In 1995, I signed an executive order that created the Community Partnership For Safe Children.
The Children's Partnership has one goal - to prevent and to reduce violence committed by and against Pennsylvania's children.
To chair this important endeavor, I appointed someone who cares deeply about our children and understands the importance of grass-roots and community-based efforts: my wife Michele.
And she has done an outstanding job.
The response has been overwhelming.
Across Pennsylvania, from inner-city Philadelphia to the farmlands of Warren County, 92 communities in 52 counties have developed Communities That Care programs under the Partnership.
The local commitment has made a real difference: after-school activities, Big Brothers and Sisters, parenting education and tutors for kids.
We've even gotten the attention of General Colin Powell, who will combine America's Promise with the Children's Partnership.
This budget will direct more than $11 million - double the current funding - to the Children's Partnership.
Let's use the new funds to put Communities That Care in all 67 counties.
And to ensure that the Partnership's important work continues in future years, I ask the General Assembly to make it a permanent part of state government.
Violence is one enemy of children.
Poor health is another.
My budget proposes $67 million in state funds to continue the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.
Together, we've more than doubled funding for CHIP, and doubled enrollment too.
This month we reached a milestone of 90,000 enrollees -- putting Pennsylvania in the top five states when it comes to enrolling children.
We have eliminated waiting lists, enhanced benefits, expanded eligibility and simplified enrollment.
I'm pleased to say that we've helped reduce the number of uninsured Pennsylvanians to one in ten, well under the national average of one in six.
For the parents, our budget uses 40 percent of the National Tobacco Settlement to offer low-cost health insurance for an estimated 100,000 uninsured Pennsylvanians.
Another 10 percent will be given to hospitals for treating uninsured patients.
The rest will be spent on health research; on community-based and home care for seniors and Pennsylvanians with disabilities.
And, of course, on programs to help Pennsylvanians stop smoking -- and to keep our kids from ever starting.
Two weeks ago I proposed these ideas in what I called Pennsylvania's Health Investment Plan.
I look forward to hearing your ideas.
But on one demand I will insist: the money must go to improve Pennsylvania's health.
Every penny, every year.
We propose other new and important health care investments.
Expanded newborn screening.
A managed care consumer guide.
New information to help loved ones make decisions on long-term care.
I'm also pleased to announce a special initiative for Pennsylvanians with mental retardation.
Many of you have heard the wrenching human stories of older Pennsylvanians -- men and women in their 70s and 80s -- who are still caring for sons and daughters with mental retardation.
They don't yet know how their loved ones will be cared for after they die.
To ease their minds - and to provide better care for all Pennsylvanians with mental retardation -- I propose a five-year, $850 million initiative.
We'll reduce our waiting lists for living arrangements -- provide more community services - and more choices.
Let's give these stories a happy ending.
Truly, this budget is about who we are.
It's also about where we live.
"Call it the ""places behind the numbers."
"Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot, who coined the term ""conservation,"" once said, ""A nation deprived of its liberty may win it; a nation divided may unite; but a nation whose natural resources are destroyed must inevitably pay the penalty of poverty, degradation, and decay."
Governor Pinchot would have been pleased last year.
"With great support from both sides of the aisle, you passed and I signed my top legislative priority, the largest environmental investment in Pennsylvania history - the $650 million ""Growing Greener"" initiative."
With it we sowed the seeds of a new era in Penn's Woods.
Now we start reaping the rewards: $20 million this year plus $80 million over the next four to preserve farmland and protect open space.
To kick off Growing Greener, we intend to preserve 100 farms in 100 days, from the Farm Show to Earth Day.
Did you know that, since 1970, Pennsylvania has lost more than 25 percent of its farm acreage to other uses?
Over 24,000 farms have disappeared.
One thing's for certain - if we run out of farmland, Ohio or New York will not lend us any of theirs.
*** Of course, Growing Greener is not just about farms.
Over the next five years we will spend the additional half a billion dollars to clean up abandoned mines and restore watersheds; provide new and improved water and sewer systems; and create recreational trails for all Pennsylvanians to enjoy.
Yes, we're growing greener - but we must grow smarter as well.
Under the leadership of Lt. Gov. Schweiker and Kim Coon, we spent much of 1999 listening to Pennsylvanians on land use.
In 53 hearings throughout the state, they told us that we should help local government control sprawl.
So we will.
But they didn't tell us that we should mandate a one-size-fits-all approach.
So we won't.
We'll start with the largest state investment ever in land-use planning -- $3.6 million -- to give our local governments the tools they need to plan effectively for the future.
We must work together to make significant improvements and revisions to the Municipalities Planning Code.
I believe we can empower local governments and still respect private property rights.
We must bring the code into the 21st Century!
Finally, we will undertake a top-to-bottom review of state government, to make sure the state always supports sound land-use planning.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have much to do.
I believe we can get it done - yes, even in an election year.
Let us make a pledge that the campaign battles we fight outside of these chambers do not deter us from achieving results for Pennsylvanians within them.
Earlier I spoke of George Washington and his budget request to the Continental Congress.
Did it work?
Sad to say, no.
The weak and divided Congress did not answer his call.
By the end of winter, two-thirds of Washington's troops had died, deserted or were too sick to fight.
Fortunately for us, as you can see from that painting, the ones who remained kept fighting - and ultimately won a Revolution.
Today, miles and centuries removed from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania is in the middle of another revolution.
And we are winning this one as well.
It's a peaceful one - a revolution in how we create jobs, how we embrace technology, and how we view the world.
It's in how we teach our kids, how we protect our environment, and how we treat your money.
Pennsylvania will keep winning - if we stay focused on the people behind the numbers.
Let's answer their call.
I ask for your help to pass this budget for the people of Pennsylvania.
Thank you.
