SENTENCES
"Speaker Madigan, President Philip, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Constitutional officers, members of the 90th General Assembly and my fellow citizens of Illinois."
The State of Illinois is strong and growing stronger.
We have every reason to be upbeat.
"Our economy is solid, diverse, productive, vibrant and expanding."
More Illinoisans are working today than ever before.
Illinois' production and its use of trail-blazing technology will keep us in the vanguard of the 21st century global economy.
"We have embarked on a new era of efficiency in human services delivery, one that encourages the transition from welfare to work."
We have some of the best schools in the world.
Together with community leaders from all walks of life we're forging innovative partnerships.
And those partnerships are improving the quality of life for all of us in Illinois.
"It is truly an exciting and rewarding time to work, live and raise families in this great state of Illinois."
We have laid a solid foundation for brighter tomorrows.
"First and foremost, we have put the state's fiscal house in order and we intend to keep it that way."
We have eliminated more than a billion dollars in Medicaid debt.
"The State of Illinois is paying its bills on time, in fact faster than it has paid them for well over a decade."
We have balanced the Illinois budget.
We pulled the state from the brink of financial disaster without raising taxes.
And let me assure you as long as I am Governor we will not return to those days.
We will keep the Illinois budget balanced and we will pay our bills on time.
"We find ourselves in a very good fiscal situation today because we had the discipline to tighten our belts, to overcome what was a very bad fiscal situation just a few years ago."
We did it without neglecting education and the truly needy.
We did it by making better sense of state government.
We added people where we needed to add them.
Hundreds of prison guards for more prisons.
Hundreds of caseworkers to respond to abuse and neglect of children.
But elsewhere we have downsized and streamlined state government.
"And today, as a result, we have thousands fewer employees than when I became Governor six years ago."
But we have not scaled back our resolve to address the major challenges our state is facing and to provide the services that our citizens need and deserve.
"We are meeting those challenges and improving the services by being more effective, efficient and innovative."
More and more state agencies are using computer capabilities to control costs and respond more quickly to constituents.
We are headed in the right direction in managing state government.
And I am pleased to report that our efforts have helped to strengthen our economy.
"Today, as I deliver my seventh State of the State address, I am proud to say the Illinois economy has never been more robust."
It has been growing and most of the experts predict it will keep growing.
"The diversity, stability and potential of our economy will boost us to new heights as we approach and enter the new Century."
"Since I stood here as a new Governor delivering my first State of the State address in 1991, Illinois businesses have created nearly a half-million new jobs."
More than 5.8 million people are working in Illinois.That is an all-time high.
Illinois manufacturing jobs have increased even as manufacturing jobs declined nationally.
Our unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in more than two decades.
"It's been lower than the national average for the past three years- a performance that has not been seen in this state for a long, long time."
"The employment outlook of our state is bright, particularly in skilled jobs, because our state's business climate has never been better."
There are several good reasons for that.
"For too many years, from the mid-70s through the 80s, Illinois was viewed by business as unfriendly.It cost us jobs.That is no longer the case."
"Thanks to our hard work during the '90s, Illinois is now viewed as a state where businesses should expand, where businesses should locate, and where businesses should create jobs.And they are."
We have held the line on taxes for businesses and individuals for seven straight years.
We have stopped over-regulating and last year we slashed unemployment insurance taxes to stimulate job creation in Illinois.
We have outlawed frivolous lawsuits that made a few lawsuit-happy lawyers rich but drove up the cost of doing business in our state.
"As a result, we have seen unprecedented economic growth and we are sustaining the momentum."
"In recent months, we have seen dozens and dozens of Illinois employers announce expansion plans, creating and saving tens of thousands of jobs."
"You know many of the names: Ford, Tellabs, Ameritech, Amoco, 3M, Motorola, Knapheide, Alcoa, National Steel and General Electric."
"In addition, more than a dozen foreign-owned firms including Nissan and Canadian National have invested millions and millions of dollars in just the last year."
And we have helped Illinois companies tap more foreign markets.
Illinois exports have ballooned by more than 50 percent in the last four years.
Our state has set the pace for the Midwest and outpaced export growth nationwide.
"Since 1993, export-related jobs in Illinois have grown by more than 200,000 and now number nearly 600,000."
"Through productive trade missions and our offices abroad, we are promoting more Illinois products and services overseas."
"And most importantly, we're helping thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses and industries find a niche in this dynamic global marketplace."
"With Lieutenant Governor Kustra playing a pivotal role in developing and implementing our economic development strategy, our state is demonstrating in many, many ways that we want businesses to grow and prosper here so our people can grow and prosper for years to come."
One very good example is how we have worked with businesses and our universities to make advanced technology an engine for economic expansion.
"High-tech companies are spinning off from our universities, laboratories and industries to create even more jobs."
Our Silicon Prairie is achieving a worldwide reputation for quality and innovation.
"And we are also working in partnership with universities and businesses to assure that small business owners throughout the state can get expert advice on technology, markets and improved productivity."
That advice can make the difference between success and failure.
"Moreover, when it comes to regulating business, we have proven that we can protect the environment, the consumer and the bottom line by replacing nonsense with common sense."
"Through a program called Clean Break, we are working with our small businesses to help them comply with environmental laws."
Clean Break is helping businesses be the good citizens almost all of them want to be without destroying their bottom line.
"Not bigger government, better government."
"Not more bureaucracy, not more paperwork, but good old common sense."
"Our air, our water, our soil are cleaner today than they were a decade ago."
And we are committed to making them even cleaner.
We have proven we can protect and improve our environment without poisoning the economy of our state.
"So this year we are expanding Clean Break to cover all of the estimated 600,000 small businesses in our state."
And this year we will take other steps in partnership with business to strengthen the Illinois economy and to help our people participate in its growth.
"In the past year we have developed a network of 47 regional employment and training offices where people seeking jobs can easily tap into a whole host of employment, job training and related services."
"This summer, Illinois and 19 other states will join together on the Internet to match workers seeking employment with businesses needing help."
And we will continue to use our resources to help meet the job training and infrastructure needs of businesses seeking to expand or locate in Illinois.
We cannot allow ourselves to bask in success.We must learn from it.And we must build on it.
That is what we have done in addressing the needs of the poor in our state.
"Long before Washington enacted welfare reform, we were overhauling welfare and other human service programs in Illinois."
"And many of our new, fresh approaches have become models for the nation."
Our welfare reform works because it rewards self-sufficiency and not continued dependency.
We've gotten rid of rules that made no sense.
Families on welfare no longer have to break up to avoid a cut in benefits.
The father can remain in the home where he belongs.
Two-parent families can keep more of what they earn to smooth the transition from welfare to work.
Recipients are no longer penalized for taking temporary or part-time jobs.
"In fact, they are encouraged to take them so they can move more quickly to independence."
"In the past year alone, our reforms have helped more than 31,000 families move from the welfare rolls to payrolls."
I'm proud of those results and you should be too.
But years ago we decided that reforming welfare is not enough.
"We needed to change, dramatically and boldly, the way we deliver services to all those in need in our state."
Not only families receiving welfare checks.
But also families and individuals who look to the state for service and leadership for reasons other than poverty.
"Last year, I proposed and signed into law the most sweeping reorganization of state government since the early 1900s."
It will combine programs that have spread over a half-dozen different agencies into one agency.
Not so we can move around some blocks on a state government organization chart.
"Not even so we can save tax dollars, although we will save some by eliminating overlap and duplication."
We want to serve people more effectively so they can be more productive.
"Beginning July 1, the new Department of Human Services will provide a streamlined, one-stop shopping approach to service delivery."
Many of the needy have been dealing with several case managers and often receive conflicting advice.
Now there will be one case manager.
"One case manager to focus on the big picture when dealing with families and individuals instead of trying to address their problems with an array of fragmented, uncoordinated services."
This retooling and re-energizing of state services was not developed in a vacuum.
"It is a product of what we accomplished and learned by launching and expanding other innovative programs, beginning with Project Success."
"The goal of Project Success was simple: Using schools as the focal point, make state and community services readily available to children experiencing health and family problems."
To accomplish that goal we did several things.
We insisted that existing resources be better utilized.
That meant doing a better job of coordinating state and community services.
It meant breaking down bureaucratic barriers.
"It meant getting people of the community involved- parents, teachers, social service workers, churches, synagogues, business leaders and local agencies."
It meant listening to them and responding to them.
We did it because it made sense to do it.
People living in communities are closer to the problems and more invested in solving them than someone sitting in an office miles and miles away in Springfield or in Chicago.
"I was delighted a few weeks ago when one of our most successful Project Success sites, Carpentersville School District No."
"300, won the prestigious Lincoln Foundation Award for Excellence in Education in Illinois."
That award came on the heels of the J. C. Penney National Golden Rule Award for community volunteerism.
I congratulate all who have had a hand in making a difference there.
"Seated with Brenda in the gallery are three leaders in the Carpentersville effort: Linda Kolbusz, who is assistant superintendent of schools as well as coordinator of Project Success; Silvia Realzola, a parent and volunteer in the program; and Margo White, president of the Chamber of Commerce.Would you please stand?"
And I congratulate those in communities throughout the state who have made a positive difference through Project Success.
Thank you for being our partners.
Thank you for joining us in learning valuable lessons that are going to make this great state an even greater state.
Project Success began as an education initiative to remove roadblocks to learning.
But it has become a centerpiece and an inspiration for human service reform in Illinois.
Making better use of existing resources through cooperation and better coordination.
"Reorganizing state government so it can work more effectively with communities, families and individuals."
Working side-by-side with community leaders.
We are reaching out in more ways to more communities than ever before.
"In another innovative reform, we are working with community groups in five cities to deliver human services and solve neighborhood problems more effectively."
One of those projects in a neighborhood struggling with rising crime and poverty is just a few blocks from this Capitol building.
It features Illinois' first one-stop center for case management.
"The neighborhood center is designed to help keep families together, safe and healthy, and smooth their transition from welfare to work."
"And as we add other regional one-stop service centers across Illinois, we will help more people end their dependency on welfare."
"Meanwhile, at another project site named the Grand Boulevard Community on the south side of Chicago, community leaders are focusing on helping people get jobs and keep them."
"Responding to that community's commitment, United Parcel Service has made a huge contribution to the future of welfare reform across Illinois."
UPS voluntarily earmarked 50 good-paying entry level jobs for welfare recipients involved in the Grand Boulevard project.
"The community and state agencies are working together to support those workers by arranging for child care, transportation and mentoring where necessary."
"UPS officials say the program is working, that the people they've hired really want to work."
One of those people is Rosetta Dunbar.
Rosetta is a single mother of four who is moving to get off welfare by working part-time at UPS.
"Like others I talked to, she said she wanted to set a good example for her children."
And her bosses say she is doing a great job.
Rosetta Dunbar is with us today seated in the gallery.
"Please stand and be recognized, Rosetta."
What Rosetta Dunbar and UPS have done together with community leaders in Grand Boulevard and the State of Illinois is precisely what needs to be done throughout the state if welfare reform is to succeed.
This is a program that is making a difference in the lives of real people.
"More private firms, community leaders and government agencies must come together and make jobs available to those in the greatest need if we are to move more people from welfare to work."
"Therefore, next week I will convene a summit with the chief executive officers of dozens of Illinois' largest and most successful employers."
I am urging their firms to join UPS as major players in welfare reform.
"Together, our goal is to help thousands of welfare recipients join the thousands who already have made the leap to employment."
I am confident these forward-thinking companies will set an example of success for hundreds of other firms across Illinois.
"Meanwhile, the First Lady will be convening concerned community leaders from across the state to exchange views on another issue vital to our state- violence, particularly violence toward children."
We know there are no easy answers.
"We also know that those who deal with this crucial problem day in and day out in their communities are in the best position to determine what is needed, what works and what doesn't work."
"At the conference Brenda will convene this spring in the Executive Mansion, they will have an opportunity to share their thoughts and experiences, to teach each other, to learn from each other, to encourage each other and to help all of us better understand what we're up against."
"Brenda this year also will launch and spearhead another initiative for this administration, one dedicated to improving the health of women throughout our state."
"More than 2,000 Illinois women die from breast cancer every year."
"One million Illinois women suffer from a devastating disease that causes bones to become thin and brittle causing great pain, loss of independence and even death."
My own mother suffered from this disease before she died.
"With the aging of the baby boom generation, millions of women are facing mid-life changes that have physical and psychological impact."
Women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and face the misunderstanding associated with this real mental illness.
It is time to recognize and do more about the health problems women face.
We know that prevention and early treatment can come from increased awareness and guidance.
"Brenda's successful ""Help Me Grow"" program will serve as the model for the women's health initiative."
It will maximize existing state services.
It will be funded primarily through support from the private sector.
It will feature a major public awareness campaign.
It will provide a vast array of information available through an 800 number.
"And the appropriate state agencies will be geared up to assure that the response is quick, comprehensive and effective."
"In just three years, ""Help Me Grow"" has generated nearly 100,000 calls from parents seeking advice on health and other issues relating to their children."
Those calls prevented major problems and saved lives.
The support network coming from this women's health initiative will do the same.
"On another health front, we are pressing ahead with sweeping reforms to better address the needs of those with mental illness or disabilities."
Again our premise has been and continues to be that these needs should be addressed and met at the community level wherever possible.Closer to loved ones.
Where those who need services can be as productive and independent as possible.
Last fall we launched our newest mental health reform initiative.
It will provide $7.2 million in grants to improve community-based services this year and more next year.
"By assuring better community treatment services for people being discharged from state hospitals, far fewer are finding it necessary to return."
This initiative builds on reforms we already have made to bolster these important community-based services.
And I am pleased to report that state hospital admissions have been cut in half.
"At the same time, patients in state hospitals also are receiving better care because we are providing more staff for each patient."
"And improvements in technology are giving mental health providers more complete, immediate and accurate information on all patients."
Modern technology also is helping us to deal more effectively with the challenges we face in fighting violence and gang crime.
"This year, the Illinois State Police will launch a criminal data network that is the first of its kind in the nation."
The network will provide information to law enforcement agencies at every level of government as well as universities and other state agencies.
"The system, called VITAL, will provide comprehensive support for community-policing efforts with a single inquiry."
"Better information, faster communications, more timely arrests- one more weapon against youth violence, drug dealing and street gangs in our state.But we must do more."
"That's why just last week, I awarded grants to 60 community-based groups for crime and drug prevention programs."
"Those grants will help communities provide youth support to resist gang influence, illegal drug use and other criminal activity through after-school programs, safe havens, mentoring programs, drop-in centers and Neighborhood Watch programs."
"The Governor's Commission on Gangs, under the strong leadership of Attorney General Jim Ryan, has developed an action plan that I believe will prove very effective in waging war on gangs."
It toughens penalties for gang-related crime.
It helps to mobilize and energize communities.
It gives them instant access to information on programs that have worked well in other cities across the state and the nation.
And it arms local police with more intelligence on gang activity.
"Elsewhere on the law enforcement front, we are building on reforms we have made through the years to assure that our prisons are safer for guards and well-managed."
This fall we will complete construction of the Super Max prison in Southern Illinois.
"It will house those prisoners who make big problems for guards, prison officials and inmates who want to behave."
I could go into detail but the bottom line is this: Prisoners won't want to end up there.
We also are converting the Pontiac prison into a permanently locked down facility that will house those who are prime candidates for the Super Max.
Pontiac will house prisoners who have broken rules and belong in segregation.
"The message is clear: If you're a bad prisoner, we've got just the place for you."
We also are going to build on our efforts to keep drugs out of our prisons.
State-of-the-art equipment will detect drugs on visitors and employees.
And we are determined to implement random drug testing of prison employees who come into contact with inmates.
"Meanwhile, we will continue and expand our efforts to protect and preserve our natural resources."
"Our Conservation 2000 initiative, the purchase of Site M, our efforts to develop recreational areas on land where the Joliet and Savanna arsenals were located- in these and other initiatives, we have made monumental investments in the future of this state, not only to save our environment, but also to provide new recreational opportunities for our people."
"And under the leadership of the Lieutenant Governor, we are fully prepared to launch another major initiative to clean up and enhance the Illinois River, one of this state's most valuable natural resources."
"During this year, we will pledge state dollars to attract the necessary federal dollars for this very worthwhile project."
"Now let me move to education, which must be our top priority."
"Our public and private universities, our four-year colleges and our community colleges are among the best assets this state has."
"We've made better, broader use of them in recent years using their expertise to fuel job creation, especially in high-tech areas."
"Our Distance Learning initiative this year will give more than 8,000 college and high school students access to additional courses through telecommunications."
"In several other ways, our colleges and universities have improved because we pressed for improvements."
There is more emphasis on undergraduate education.
Programs that could not be justified are gone.
And layers of bureaucracy have been eliminated.
"Art Quern, who was tragically taken from us in a plane crash last fall, was a driving force behind many of those improvements through his service as Chairman of the Board of Higher Education."
Art's contributions in higher education and other aspects of state government over the years have made this state a better place and will be long remembered.
"In elementary and secondary education, the need for reform has been even more pressing.And we have responded."
"We enacted landmark legislation to reform the Chicago public school system, reform that has earned national attention and praise."
"Indeed, President Clinton himself is highlighting our initiative during his visit to Chicago today."
"As a result of our initiative, the Chicago School Reform Board has been able to balance its budget without coming to Springfield for more money."
It has begun privatizing many of its non-educational services and it has demanded accountability of its schools.
We also established charter schools to encourage and stimulate innovation in school districts throughout the state.
And we've given public schools added flexibility through waivers from unnecessary mandates.
We've paved the way for alternative schools to deal with disruptive students.
We expect new and tougher academic standards to be in place by this summer.
Standards for what Illinois students should know and be able to do at every stage of their education.
Standards to ensure that all students that graduate from high school will be ready for the workforce of the next century.
Standards developed with the aid and advice of community leaders throughout this state.
We're rapidly improving students' and teachers' access to information on the Internet.
Last year we launched an ambitious plan to connect all Illinois schools to the Internet with high-speed T-One lines within four years.We're well ahead of schedule.
"By the end of June more than 1,000 of our schools will be connected."
By this time next year we will have doubled that number.
"Through rapid Internet access and better electronic links among schools, continuing education for teachers will become much more available and efficient."
"And that is important, for as we raise standards and improve technology, we must ensure that we have top-quality teachers to get the job done."
"That is why we will implement recommendations on teacher certification, preparation and continuing development made by a national commission on which I served, a commission to improve teaching."
"We also want to make better use of another great resource in our state, the Illinois Math and Science Academy, where many of the best and the brightest in our state teach and are taught."
"Academy researchers and educators, working with the State Board of Education and Board of Higher Education, will use their skills to transform the teaching of math, science and technology in schools across Illinois."
"We have met many, many challenges in education."
But I will need the help of this Legislature to address challenges that still face us today.
"And of those, the challenge that I believe is the most important to the future of our state is also the most daunting."
"As I have said many times, and will say again many times, we need to reform the way we fund our public schools."
The state is providing 800 million dollars more for elementary and secondary education now than it was only four years ago.
We increased school funding by record amounts without raising taxes.I'm proud of that.And you should be too.
"But, even with that infusion of new state money, our system of funding education remains unfair."
Nearly sixty cents of every dollar spent on our public schools comes from local property taxes.That is not fair.
"We spend $3,000 per student in one school district and more than $15,000, five times as much, in another.That is not fair.And it is simply not right."
"Last spring, a commission headed by former University of Illinois president Stan Ikenberry recommended a constitutional amendment."
It would have required at least $1.5 billion in property tax relief.
It would have required adequate funding per pupil in every school in this state.
I supported that amendment which would have given voters a say last November if the Legislature had agreed to put it on the ballot.
And I still believe the Ikenberry report is correct and should be the blueprint for reform.
We should reduce property taxes at least $1.5 billion.
"We should establish an adequate level of funding of at least $4,225 per student, as recommended by the Ikenberry Commission."
The state should pay at least half the basic cost of providing a quality education to each and every child in Illinois and it will under this approach.
We should be straight with taxpayers: We can't substantially reduce their local property taxes and make the system fairer without increasing some state taxes to offset the loss in revenues to school districts.
I believe the income tax is the fairest.
But I am certainly willing to consider a combination of revenue measures and other possibilities.
Agreeing on a solution won't be easy.
I expect there will be several proposals and there will be reluctance on the part of the Legislature to act.
"If school funding reform were easy, it would have been done decades ago."
But I'm committed to it and I hope you are too.
I have been working during the last several weeks on reaching a consensus with advocates of funding reform on a specific plan.
It is very important that those who favor reform work in concert.Division means defeat.
Based on what I heard legislators and legislative candidates say during the fall campaign they're committed to funding reform as well.
"I heard them say they didn't need a vote of the people, which I have favored, to force them into action.And so I say let us act."
We have demanded more accountability and better results from our schools.
We must continue to demand more.
But we should not duck our own responsibility.
Let's reform education funding.This spring.Not next year.This year.Not after the next election.Before the next election.
"And speaking of elections, we need to make some reforms."
"Once again, I call on the Legislature to move the state primary from March to a later month."
"Two years ago, at this podium, I recommended September."
I'm not wedded to that but I believe the people of Illinois will welcome a shorter campaign season.
And I also believe we should continue reforming our campaign finance laws.
I have always been a great believer in disclosure.
The public and the media should be able to find out easily where candidates for public office get money and how they spend it.
"We should require full identification of contributors, listing an individual's occupation and employer along with his or her name."
And I believe we should eliminate the requirement that people examining disclosure reports identify themselves and state a purpose for their examination.
"It is not necessary and it can be intimidating, particularly to the general public."
I also believe we should take action to encourage more small contributions so there will be less reliance on big contributions.
"When the campaign finance disclosure act was approved more than 20 years ago, there was concern that some small businesses and others that might otherwise contribute would be intimidated, afraid to lose business or friends."
So it was determined that only contributions exceeding $150 would need to be reported.That was two decades ago.
And $150 then compares to $475 now.
So I believe it is appropriate and realistic to raise the threshold to $250 to encourage and protect small contributors.
I also am proposing that we establish penalties for those who fail to properly disclose large contributions received in the final days of a campaign.
And I want existing penalties increased fivefold for all other campaign disclosure reports that are not filed on time.
Another major mission we share is to deregulate the electric utility industry.
Deregulation will increase competition.
"More importantly, it will provide rate relief."
It will make it more attractive to do business and create jobs in Illinois.
It also will have a positive impact on homeowners and renters.
But the mission is as complex as it is compelling.
So earlier this week I appointed a panel of experts on this issue to help provide better direction and insight to our efforts.
My charge to them and to you is clear and simple.
We must ensure fairness to all.
"All consumers, whether big business or average citizens, should share in the cost-savings and other benefits of competition under the same timeframe."
"I also am calling on you to address an issue I have visited, and revisited with the Legislature during the last two years: Our capital projects program."
"For two years, the votes have not been there in the Legislature to build more prisons which we need to ease the crowding in our current prisons, to assure that dangerous people are kept behind bars and to keep our guards as safe as possible."
"For two years, the votes have not been there to make capital improvements and fund maintenance projects at our state universities, at our community colleges, at our mental health facilities and at the Chicago Transit Authority."
"For two years, the votes have not been there to create construction jobs for more than 15,000 workers by moving ahead with projects that need to be done."
The votes have not been there for purely partisan reasons.That's irresponsible.And it's wrong.
"During the last several weeks, I have heard welcome comments from legislative leaders in both parties about cooperation, about working together for the good of the people of this state."
"A bill to build prisons, to do what should be done at community colleges, state universities, mental health hospitals, the CTA and to create thousands of construction jobs already has been introduced in this session of the General Assembly."
I am asking you to approve it immediately.
Let's begin cooperating now with this legislation we all know is needed.
"It will set the right tone for dealing with other issues, like school funding."
This session of the Legislature could well be an historic one.
I salute the outstanding work that was done with Senator Philip and Speaker Daniels as presiding officers in 1995 and 1996.
"But 1997, with Senator Philip and now with Speaker Madigan as presiding officers, offers the opportunity to build immensely on those achievements."
"We need courage and bipartisanship to meet our responsibilities to the people of Illinois, and more importantly, to future generations of Illinoisans.We share many goals."
A better quality of life for all Illinoisans.
More good-paying jobs and less dependence on government.
Self-sufficiency for all families and quality education for all.
"Safer homes and streets and stronger, healthier families."
"In pursuit of these ideals, we will continue to seek guidance and wisdom from community leaders in all quarters of this great state."
We will realize the very most of our potential because we will have drawn from the very best our state can offer.
We will concentrate our efforts by redoubling the work of leaders in every neighborhood.
"Together, we have the power to strengthen our families, champion fairness, restore equity and rekindle hope."
"And with your continued commitment, this great State of Illinois will enjoy a new era of opportunity and understanding for all its people.Thank you very much."
