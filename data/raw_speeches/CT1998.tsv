sentences
Mr. Speaker, Madame President, reverend clergy, friends and guests.
Thank you very much.
Words cannot express how proud I am to serve the people of Connecticut as your governor.
We are living in a new era that once again rewards Yankee ingenuity and we are thriving.
In Connecticut we have always believed that with hard work, tomorrow will be a better day.
It is through hard work that we have overcome the economic turmoil of the first half of the 1990’s and emerged stronger than before.
And now, we are using our forward momentum to build a better Connecticut.
As we begin this legislative session, it is my plan to stick with the same consistent policies that have guided our return to prosperity.
My agenda for 1998: Further tax cuts.
And new investments to improve the quality of life for Connecticut’s children.
These goals can be embraced by all of us, regardless of party.
Bi-partisanship has served Connecticut well over the last three years and I want to make clear my intention to continue working together with Republicans and Democrats, for the good of Connecticut, throughout this legislative session.
A year ago I spoke to you about Connecticut’s comeback and today the building of a better Connecticut is underway.
When I took office in 1995 the people of Connecticut had endured almost a full decade of increasing taxes, deficits, a paralyzing budget crisis, and an economy in shambles.
But that’s all behind us now.
This dramatic change has been possible in part because we in government have empowered the people to improve their own lives.
We have changed the rules, we have changed perceptions, and we have raised expectations.
Welfare recipients have been empowered to go back to work.
Today more than 22,000 of our welfare clients have jobs.
An average of one thousand clients a month are leaving welfare before their 21 month time limit expires.
That’s great progress.
Local school boards have been released from the hindering requirements of state government so that they can improve schools based on community needs.
The tax burden on the average family has been reduced through cuts in the income tax, property taxes, the inheritance tax, and the gas tax.
New businesses are moving to Connecticut every day as corporate tax rates come down.
And I promise, by the end of this session, Connecticut will see even more tax cuts.
A cultural change has taken place in the way we do business, in what we expect from each other, and in what the people expect from their government.
More government is not the answer to every problem.
It’s not even debatable.
"In fact, in a growing economy like Connecticut’s, sometimes the best thing government can do is; ""just stay out of the way."
The budget adjustments I present to you today are consistent with my fundamental philosophy of cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, eliminating unnecessary regulations, and investing in the people and institutions that hold the key to our future.
In 1995 Connecticut’s economic outlook was precarious.
But together we made the right decisions.
We took Connecticut in the right direction and that hard work is creating opportunity for all.
Because we ended the deficits of the late ‘80’s and the tax increases of the early ‘90’s we have been able to invest nearly two billion dollars in the rebuilding of our public college and university campuses.
Because we have held the line on spending growth we are now able to invest more than ever in primary and secondary education.
Because we’ve ended the practice of coddling criminals and putting their rights before the rights of their victims, Connecticut is now a safer place to live and raise a family.
We have convinced Connecticut business and industry that a clean environment is in their best interest.
And because we’ve made that cultural change we have been able to concentrate our efforts on preserving open space, cleaning up Long Island Sound, and opening new state parks.
We are investing millions of dollars in economic development projects that give our cities new hope, because we have ended the practice of corporate welfare.
From the waterfront development project in Bridgeport, to the major new initiative we announced this week in New London, to the redevelopment of Hartford, we are in better position than ever to turn our urban centers into shining examples of a new Connecticut.
And because we have made dramatic changes in our efforts to recruit and attract new business, Connecticut is now the proud home of over 160 new firms that employ thousands in the high paying, high skilled jobs that make Connecticut a competitor in the new global economy.
These achievements did not happen by accident.
They happened because we set a course on day one and we stuck to it.
Now more than ever it’s important that we not change direction as we move forward.
We are poised to regain a competitive advantage over other states by initiating our new industry cluster approach to economic development.
It is important for groups of businesses in fields such as bio-technology, financial services, and tourism to work together, sometimes with the help of state government, to grow and remain at the forefront of change.
If we are not constantly improving we are falling behind.
Transportation is critical to the success of an expanding economy.
That’s why I’m moving forward with plans to relieve congestion on I-95 in Fairfield County and a $135 million expansion of Bradley International Airport.
In eastern Connecticut, I’m committed to the completion of route 11 and the construction of a new and safer route 6.
I’m also calling on the legislature this session to finish the work begun last year on the deregulation of the electric utility industry.
Deregulation will ensure safety, lead to lower prices and guarantee reliability for consumers of electric power.
From where we stood in 1995 few would have predicted the success we are enjoying now.
Our own fear of the future kept us from looking ahead to consider how we could prepare today for the challenges of tomorrow.
Now we are looking ahead with even greater determination.
Last week my Commission on Open Space presented its report and recommendations.
Connecticut’s woods and waterways have always been one of our greatest assets.
Because we are making an economic comeback, we now have an ability to invest further in the preservation of open space.
Today I propose we increase Connecticut’s stock of open space to twenty one percent for the twenty first century.
This means a commitment of more than $160 million over the next five years for land preservation.
If we can meet our goal of twenty one percent we will have improved the quality of life for all Connecticut residents by preserving more than half a million acres of open land for future generations.
Connecticut has always been a leader in environmental protection.
Over the last three years we have steadily improved our efforts to clean up Long Island Sound, we are fighting for better air quality, we are re-opening seven closed state parks, and creating a brand new state park in Milford.
When Silver Sands State Park opens this year it will be the first time since the 1930’s that Connecticut has created a new shoreline state park for the enjoyment of all.
Not long ago we lived in a state constantly at war with itself over the future of education.
Unfortunately, the battle has been fought in our courtrooms.
Horton vs. Meskill.
Sheff vs. O’Neill.
While these battles raged on for years we seemed to forget the children.
Today those battles in the courtroom have been replaced by cooperation and we have seen the results.
Test scores continue to rise.
Innovation is being rewarded.
We’ve worked together to begin to resolve the issues of segregation in our city schools.
And in Hartford, we have stepped in to help resurrect a school system that was unable to help itself.
A month ago I spoke to the State Board of Education about a series of proposals I have included in this year’s budget.
My list of twenty ideas for the future is the most targeted package of new education programs in the last decade.
The primary focus of my education initiative is to improve reading skills, give local school boards more control, and make respect and responsibility part of the five R’s of public education in Connecticut.
I’d like to ask all of you to reflect on your own experience growing up.
Next to your parents and your family, who was the most influential person in your life?
I’ll bet it was a teacher.
I had lots of great teachers.
Teachers like Terry Guay in the fourth grade.
And later, my high school wrestling coach Jim Cunningham.
Both are here today.
Terry and Jim were and are my teachers, because the lessons they taught me all those years ago, still guide me today.
My teachers cared about me and they cared about my classmates.
They cared about whether we sat up straight.
Cared about whether we combed our hair.
Made sure we raised our hands in class.
Made sure we did our homework.
Made us responsible citizens.
There is a misperception that the teachers of today don’t care the same way ours did.
Well, during the last three years I’ve visited countless schools in cities and towns across this state and I’m here to report that the teachers of today do care.
They care about our kids’ manners, they care about homework getting done, they worry about whether children are getting a good breakfast before school and what they do after school.
The teachers of today are the sons and daughters of Terry Guay and Jim Cunningham and they are the role models for the next century.
But they can’t do it alone.
It’s easy to spend more money inventing new programs.
But often those efforts place the responsibility of raising our children on teachers.
As parents, we must play a greater role, not a lesser role, in the education of our children.
Be a partner with your children’s teachers.
Parent to parent I ask that we join the teachers of tomorrow in returning respect and responsibility to the classroom.
Connecticut will be a better place if we fill it with better citizens.
My education package provides funding to hire 300 new reading teachers for grades one and two, because reading is the golden link to a good education.
If we can teach kids to excel in reading at an early age we give them an advantage throughout their school careers and throughout their lives.
The package also provides new funding for library books, programs to improve reading skills, and rewards programs that bring innovation to the classroom.
Obviously, none of us can accurately predict what Connecticut’s economic landscape will be like when today’s first graders graduate from college.
But we do know, that the workforce of tomorrow, will be even more dependent on computers.
That’s why this budget maintains and expands our commitment to provide funding to put computers in every classroom in this state.
Computer literacy is one of the new fundamentals of a good education.
I want every student to have the opportunity to develop computer skills.
Computers should be the blackboard and chalk of today’s classroom, because they are the hammer and nails of tomorrow’s workplace.
This education package represents an additional $93 million in spending for this fiscal year, or an additional $500 million over the next five years.
But it’s not the amount of money that’s important – it’s how we spend it.
That’s why these new spending proposals come with the requirement that 95% goes directly to students, while only 5% can be spent on administration.
This package calls for greater accountability and gives local school boards more power to correct problems before they become a crisis.
Specifically, taking an idea from our experience with the Hartford school system, I am putting forth a proposal that would allow local school boards to close down chronically failing schools and re-open them with new teachers and staff.
Following on the success we’ve seen with programs like UCONN 2000 and the CSU 2000 plan I’ve proposed a similar plan for the state’s vocational-technical schools.
These schools have been ignored for far too long.
The vo-tech system in our state has always been an important part of the mix of educational opportunities we provide.
It can be argued that they are Connecticut’s first magnet schools.
They are in desperate need of renovation and upgrade if they are going to continue to be a source of employees for Connecticut’s growing high tech manufacturing sector.
Training skilled workers and enhancing the quality of life in Connecticut.
That’s the role of our system of education.
The new education funding is part of our overall effort to provide state aid to cities and towns.
Over the last ten years we have increased state aid to municipalities by $700 million.
Bridgeport and New Haven are receiving twice as much state aid as they did in 1988 and Hartford alone gets almost $200 million a year.
All three cities have cut property tax rates as a result of state aid.
But the centerpiece of my budget proposals for this year is a continued effort to lower tax rates for all Connecticut residents.
Through prudent budgeting, and as a result of our improving economy, Connecticut is on its way to posting its fourth consecutive budget surplus estimated at – at least – $180 million.
Over the last four years I have made an effort to offer responsible tax cutting plans.
I have cut taxes wherever and whenever possible with a special emphasis on the income tax.
Though it may have been politically popular for me to propose even deeper cuts, I have never put Connecticut’s economic recovery at risk by putting the state’s financial standing in jeopardy.
My tax cutting efforts have expanded beyond the income tax to include the gas tax, property tax credits, business tax reductions, and the inheritance tax; and once again this year I am proposing a further reduction in the income tax.
The proposal I submit to you today would allow us to reduce the income tax by another $200 million.
Taken together with tax cuts already in place this income tax reduction would mean an extra $650 a year for the average family to be used toward a mortgage payment, college tuition, car payments, or even savings.
Additionally I want Connecticut residents to benefit directly from our bi-partisan effort to hold the line on spending.
The budget surpluses of the last four years are approaching $800 million.
For the first time since the mid 1980’s we have nearly $400 million in our Rainy Day Fund and we are paying off one billion dollars in debt, ending the budget nightmare of 1991 once and for all.
It’s time the people of Connecticut got their money back.
I want to return $125 million of this year’s surplus to the people of Connecticut through tax rebates.
It’s their money and they’re entitled to it.
Under my proposal the average family of four would get a rebate check of $200.
This would be in addition to the tax cuts already on the books.
If the people of Connecticut pay more in taxes than we need to finance the cost of government – then they deserve a rebate.
It’s their money.
They earned it.
Let’s give it back.
Let’s also continue to drive down the cost of gasoline.
Last year we responded to public outcry over high gas prices by cutting the gas tax by 6 cents.
The next 3 cent per gallon cut in the gas tax is scheduled to take effect in July.
I would like to add another penny to that scheduled tax cut and make it take effect even sooner.
This April.
Let’s make sure that Connecticut motorists will see gas prices drop another four cents a gallon in the spring before the start of the summer driving season.
In building a better Connecticut, nothing is more important to me than continuing our work on behalf of neglected and abused children.
We have steadily increased our budget for social workers in the Department of Children and Families, we have created an Office of the Child Advocate, and we have launched an extensive effort to recruit foster parents.
Our commitment to children will be extended this year with the full implementation of our HUSKY program.
Up to 90,000 children, who previously had no health insurance, will now be covered through a program we developed using both state and federal funding.
It’s one of the best programs in the country.
When it comes to children’s health and safety the more we spend on prevention the less we spend on correcting the consequences of inaction.
That’s why I’m proposing an additional expenditure of $2 million for the Children’s Trust Fund.
That’s a tenfold increase in a program I think has been under funded for too long.
The Children’s Trust Fund supports prevention programs designed to improve the physical health of children, increase school readiness, and prevent child abuse.
The money we invest in our children is the smartest investment we can make in the future of Connecticut.
Connecticut is home to many of the nation’s premiere hospitals.
And one of the best children’s hospitals is located right here in Hartford.
Parents from all over this country know of the excellent care given at the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center.
Because the hospital cares for such special patients with very special needs it finds itself in need of financial assistance.
My budget includes $8 million to make sure the important work being done there continues and that no sick child is ever denied the best care possible.
We all agree on the importance of providing for the future of our children, but it is just as important that we not forget the contributions older citizens have made to our success.
I am proposing an increase in funding to the elderly rental assistance program to help even more elderly residents in assisted living programs.
I am also proposing an increase in the monthly personal needs allowance for senior citizens living in nursing homes from $30 to $50 dollars a month.
This program faced budget cuts in the early 1990’s.
It was a mistake then and we’re correcting it now.
One of the most important roles of government is helping those who can’t go it alone.
People who find themselves in crisis.
People who find themselves in a place they never expected to be.
Each and every day thousands of people call different state agencies and volunteer groups looking for guidance to get them over an unexpected bump in the road.
Today we have the technology to make that call easier.
Working with the United Way’s Infoline program, we can implement a 211 phone system for crisis intervention, similar to the 911 system we use to report medical emergencies.
I am confident we can have this system up and running by the first of next year.
Building a better Connecticut means setting new priorities.
It means saying no to state funded roller coasters and yes to better health care for kids, it means smaller class sizes and more money in taxpayers’ pockets.
It means getting the state out of the business of information technology so those savings can be invested in programs and ideas that guarantee our children a brighter future.
"In my first inaugural speech I spoke of the ""Genius of Connecticut."
The creative, unbridled talent of the people of this state.
Our job, in government is to inspire that genius.
To renew creative energies in the hearts and minds of men and women all across our state.
My vision is to create a state government that is smarter, more efficient, more sensitive, and yes - compassionate.
A government that interferes is a government that can suffocate an individual’s capacity to grow, to create, and to dream.
Freedom from government control and taxes is essential to economic and personal vitality.
My vision is to build a better Connecticut guided by leaders willing to empower individuals to improve their own lives.
Today the state of our state is healthy, vital, and robust.
A bright future is ahead.
Step by step we have made our comeback together.
Step by step we are building a better Connecticut on the foundation of the genius of the people and Yankee ingenuity.
Together we have turned the Land of Steady Habits into the Land of Steady Progress and how far we progress is unlimited.
It can only be measured by the determination to succeed, a determination that resides in the heart and soul of each and every one of us.
Now is not the time to turn back.
Let’s continue on the same path.
Cutting taxes.
Controlling the growth of government.
Investing in our children and their future.
Our job is not to make Connecticut great again.
Our job is to make Connecticut greater than ever.
Thank you all very much and God Bless the State of Connecticut.
