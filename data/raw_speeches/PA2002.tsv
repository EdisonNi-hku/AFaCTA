Thanks so much.
distinguished Pennsylvanians all.
You should know, both Kathy and I appreciate the many wonderful expressions of confidence and goodwill that you and Pennsylvanians all across the state have given us.
That support makes all the difference in the world.
And I stand here a very grateful man.
And let me formally thank you, the members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.
This great and abiding legislative body has acted quickly and has acted decisively to meet the demands of the past four months.
And, allow me also to acknowledge the determined and resilient people who send us here – the people of Pennsylvania.
all 12,281,054 of you.
We’ve worked together for seven productive years to build a new Pennsylvania.
And we have succeeded.
My friends, this is my first and final budget address.
I stand before you today as the only governor in America who holds this office as a direct result of September 11th.
And this budget I present you today, is in large measure, an outcome of that fateful day.
It’s not a frugal budget, but it is a thrifty one.
It’s not an elaborate budget, but it is a decisive one.
Thrifty, because the times demand it.
Decisive, because the times also demand it.
There’s no question where we need to begin.
We begin where we must – at 8:48 on the morning of September 11th.
For in the unspeakable minutes that followed, everything changed.
everything!
***I came to Harrisburg with Tom Ridge in January of 1995, but this administration, in many ways, was reborn on October 5th.
And it will end on the third Tuesday of next January, a mere eleven months from now.
Though it will be short in duration, with your help, this administration will be long on accomplishment.
And let me say something else right now.
In Pennsylvania, we’ve got plenty of wildlife.
We’ve got wood ducks and mallard ducks.
All kinds of ducks.
What we don’t have.
are lame ducks.
A lame duck is an office holder at the end of a term.
Friends, I’m just getting started.
All of us have been challenged by 9/11.
And all of us must make personal choices about how we’ll answer those challenges.
And make no mistake; we will be remembered by those choices.
We have a lot of work to do in the coming months.
And I’m going to need your support to do it.
Together, we’ve already affirmed the magic of our Constitution in the seamless transition of power.
Together, we’ve already provided solid and steady leadership in the months since 9/11.
And now, together, let’s give Pennsylvania strong, decisive and creative leadership over the next 11.
Let’s contend with problems and issues.
not with each other.
We must face the challenges, and make the tough choices.
We must govern and we must lead.
And we must do it together.
You know, a long time ago, when Americans were challenged to explore space, you’ll remember it was a dynamic President Kennedy who showed us the way when he said, “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
Well, we are here to make the choices and answer the challenges of the next eleven months, not because they’re easy, but because they are hard.
On September 10th, this nation couldn’t conceive of an enemy striking within its borders.
It was beyond our imagination.
Today it is lodged in our memory.
The sad truth is, on that awful day, many were taken by surprise.
But I say with pride that Pennsylvania was poised and we were ready.
Within hours of the devastating World Trade Center collapse, Pennsylvania’s elite urban search and rescue team was the first at Ground Zero, doing the job we’ve helped them train to do since 1996.
You saw “Pennsylvania” written on their backs.
All of America saw it.
They saw Pennsylvania stepping up to help a neighbor in need.
My friends, we’re honored to have with us today, the leaders of our search and rescue team.
How proud they made us.
Gentlemen please stand up and be recognized.
To you and all team members, thank you so much.
We honor you today, but we also honor thousands of other Pennsylvanians who offered their time, their money, and their blood to help our neighbors in Somerset, New York, and Washington.
And they were certainly not alone.
For in the weeks and months that followed, this great assembly also stepped up to the challenge of protecting Pennsylvanians.
We have already made some tough choices together.
Like adding 100 new state troopers in our communities, and rapid response to worker re-training, particularly for those who lost their jobs as a result of 9/11.
On my inauguration day, I stood on the steps of this grand building and said that my highest priority would be the safety and security of Pennsylvanians.
It must remain so.
Together we’re meeting that challenge.
And we will do more.
I convened the first-ever meeting of Pennsylvania’s Security Council.
And out of that I’ve determined that we need one person at the state level to coordinate and manage Pennsylvania’s safety and security.
As we’ve seen with Gov. Ridge, that job carries with it an awesome responsibility.
And I have chosen someone who is well-suited to shoulder the weight here in Pennsylvania.
Today, he’s a terrorism task force leader with the Federal Bureau of Investigation based in Pittsburgh.
He’s a thirty-year “G-man” with experience and leadership in stopping terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
His expertise makes him the best man for the job and the best man for Pennsylvania.
So, today I am proud to name Earl Freilino as Pennsylvania’s new statewide Director of Homeland Security.
Director Freilino will report directly to me.
And he will administer the vital security measures we’ve already installed, and those that I’m about to propose.
First, let’s equip and train a second urban search and rescue team, strictly for use inside Pennsylvania.
It’ll guarantee we’re ready to help ourselves as well as our neighbors.
We’ll set up a State Infrastructure Protection Center to quickly respond to threats and attacks against our bridges, our power plants and our reservoirs, to name a few.
We’ll stand up to the threat of bio-terrorism by developing our part of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System.
And we’ve already strengthened DEP’s environmental surveillance program.
To complement our first responders, we are establishing Community Emergency Response Teams.
They will help local governments carry the burden of equipment costs and training.
The President’s new Freedom Corps will dovetail nicely with our emergency response teams.
And let me say this: I want to work closely with the General Assembly on what is an extremely vital build-out.
Your work is already paying off.
For example: Senate Bill 369.
This bill would enhance our anti-terrorism efforts by providing the best, most accurate record of police and suspect encounters.
I support you in your efforts to make audio recording of police communications a top priority.
Providing for Pennsylvania’s safety and security is a massive undertaking.
And I’ve got to tell you friends, it can’t be done cheaply.
But we don’t have a choice – it must be done.
So here’s how we’re going to do it.
Today, I am announcing a new stimulus package to help us meet this expense.
Because of sound fiscal management over the past seven years, the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, or PIDA, has $280 million in funding that we can tap, without adversely affecting PIDA’s ability to operate.
And I’m asking our friends on the PIDA board to make this a reality.
We’ll use nearly $50 million of that to pay the bill for the increased cost of protecting Pennsylvanians.
And combined with federal resources, we will commit more than $200 million this year and next to Pennsylvania’s security.
It’s a smart and necessary investment in our communities, our families, and our kids.
We all shared the shock and grief of 9/11.
And we all know that it had an impact on the national economy, and here at home.
But although it reduced our resources, it did not reduce our resourcefulness.
It brought us new challenges and new choices.
I’m ready to meet those challenges and make those choices.
And I know this legislature is too.
Certainly the national economy was at a crossroads before September 11th.
And without a doubt, the attacks took the economic outlook from bad to worse.
It’s official friends.
We’re in a recession.
But what a difference between the Pennsylvania of the last recession, 10 years ago, and Pennsylvania today.
Let me tell you what I mean, because it didn’t happen by accident.
In 1985, the Rainy Day Fund was created.
It soon required that 10 percent of any ending surplus be deposited into a savings account.
When this administration came to town 10 years later in 1995, we felt it appropriate to raise the rate to 15 percent.
In other words, we forced ourselves to save more.
In fact, we made substantial extra deposits – hundreds of millions of dollars.
Now some of you may remember, we were criticized for it.
They wanted us to spend more and more.
We decided to save more and more.
After all, the Rainy Day Fund was designed to protect Pennsylvanians from tax increases during a recession.
Our decision to put away more money has grown the Rainy Day Fund to over $1 billion.
Half of that amount was the direct result of our extra savings.
And that’s the amount that we ought to withdraw for this rainy day.
And I’m not done.
It also means you can help me leave to my successor $550 million dollars for the next rainy day.
If anybody’s counting.
and I’m sure you are.
that’s about $500 million dollars more than we found when we got here in 1995.
So what’s this all mean for Pennsylvanians?Unlike other states, we’re in pretty good shape.
We’ve all experienced revenue shortfalls.
That’s no secret.
But Pennsylvania has acted responsibly by calling a freeze on some of our spending.
And just like Pennsylvania families that plan for the future, we make adjustments.
We live within our means.
We spend less.
And we save for a rainy day.
This budget does just that by reducing spending growth to only six-tenths of one percent.
Ten years ago, the old Pennsylvania enacted the largest tax increase in our state’s history: $3 billion.
But over the last seven years, with the help of those seated in this chamber today, we’ve generated $19 billion in savings for our families and businesses, through tax cuts and other progressive reforms.
Given today’s economy, we could have chosen to raise taxes.
Other states have.
But here, we’re building a winning economy, and tax increases don’t help us.
So my budget does not raise taxes.
Just take a moment and think about that.
Let me give you some context.
We’ve had 10 recessions since 1945.
And until now, Pennsylvania has raised taxes in every one of them.
The recession of ‘53 – we get the sales tax.
The recession of ‘69 – we get the income tax.
And ’91?
Well, we all know what happened then.
Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time since World War II, Pennsylvania is not raising taxes during a recession.
More remarkable still, this budget not only doesn’t raise taxes.
it cuts taxes for the eighth straight year.
We could have kept the Working Family Tax Cut at current levels.
But no amount of state spending can replace the power we give families when we help them spend their hard-earned dollars the way they want to, not the way government wants to.
Working families are often the hardest hit by recession.
So this budget proposes that we continue to reduce the tax load on our families by expanding tax forgiveness.
Under this plan, a Pennsylvania family of four earning up to $31,000 will pay no state income tax, saving that family $868.
This expansion will help another 56,000 families.
Pennsylvania is already a national leader in tax forgiveness.
Let’s keep it that way.
There’s been a lot said about the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.
Two years ago we started a nine-year phase out of this job crusher.
We could have chosen to temporarily suspend the phase-out, in light of revenue shortfalls and the recession.
But, we all know that cutting taxes is our best job creator.
We all remember the days when Pennsylvania greeted new businesses at the border with flashing red lights and a tax form.
That was the wrong message then.
And it’s the wrong message now.
Getting rid of this tax is vital to Pennsylvania’s future.
And continuing its elimination, even in these tough times, tells the world that Pennsylvania is a player.
We’re here to compete and we’re here to win.
This is the New Pennsylvania, and we’re serious about building businesses, jobs and paychecks.
So we will continue the phase-out of the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.
We’ll pay for it with the PIDA stimulus plan I mentioned a moment ago – not the Rainy Day Fund.
Now, the economic climate will force us to cut the rate of decline by half, taking us 10 years to see it vanish, instead of the original nine.
But we’ll keep it going.
Because it’s what we do in the New Pennsylvania.
Let me say just one more thing about taxes.
The time has come to address Pennsylvania’s often-criticized property tax.
For over 20 years, I have said that we ought to be looking at other options.
I don’t know if we’ll find a solution in the next 11 months, but let’s do the work necessary to move the process forward.
The choices we make as a result of September 11th are not just about protecting our borders.
Pennsylvanians must not only be safe from the fear of terrorism – they must be safe from the fear of losing their paychecks.
So let’s protect those paychecks by strengthening the training programs that prepare workers for the jobs of the future.
You’ve already helped us guarantee a rapid response to displaced workers through critical job training grants.
But it’s time to do more.
Let’s reinvest those PIDA dollars to ready today’s workforce for tomorrow’s workplaces.
I propose that we use our stimulus package to endow workforce leadership grants.
It will help our stakeholders build faster and more flexible training programs.
Let’s think big, too.
I invite you to put a bill on my desk by July 1st that fundamentally reforms our workforce-development system once and for all.
It will sharpen our focus on helping displaced workers meet the challenge of retraining for new careers.
September 11th challenged everyone.
Some lost loved ones.
Kelly Gurney lost her job.
She workedfor US Airways in Pittsburgh.
Fifteen days after the attacks, Kelly was out of work.
Her comeback is a lesson for all of us.
And I am pleased that she could join us today.
**You know, the terrorists who cost Kelly and other Pennsylvanians their jobs badly misjudged our response.
We didn’t yield to terror; it only made us stronger.
We didn’t throw in the towel; we used it to start cleaning up.
People like Kelly Gurney met the challenges, made the choices and carried on.
Can we in state government do anything less?
We must make the tough choices that define real leadership.
We must help those who need it the most.
And we must make Pennsylvania a place where tomorrow is better than yesterday.
This budget does that.
One of our greatest resources is water.
It’s critical to our natural systems and critical to our economy.
But we’ve taken it for granted way too long.
Our state water plan is 25 years out of date.
So, we’re laying the groundwork for managing our water resources.
We’ll adopt standards to protect our groundwater.
And we’ll take a dependable water plan into the 21st century.
And since I’m talking about the environment, let me assure you that we will provide the $650 million promised for Growing Greener programs.
However, to meet today’s fiscal realities, we will extend the Growing Greener program into a sixth year.
No administration since the days of Gifford Pinchot has done more to preserve and enhance our parks, forests, streams and trails.
And that will not change.
Today, we make another historic investment in technology.
Perhaps more than any other single factor, technology will keep Pennsylvania competitive well into the 21st century.
Since 1995, we’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars to put the tools of technology into the hands of Pennsylvania families, businesses and service providers.
And it's paying off big.
Consider this: seven years ago, there were only 5,000 computers on the desks of state employees.
Today, there are more than 50,000 powered up.
Ten years ago, Pennsylvania was still known for rivets and rust.
Today, we’re a hot spot for technology, ranked in the Top 10 for high-tech jobs.
This budget continues that investment with more than $36.5 million in additional funding for Imagine PA and the Statewide Public Safety Radio Network.
Imagine PA will put all of us in state government on the same page, slashing red tape that slows us down, and making us more responsive to customers.
And our Statewide Radio Network makes our emergency preparedness the best it can be.
It instantly links state agencies like PEMA and the State Police with mobile response crews.
Technology represents a profound investment in Pennsylvania’s future.
let’s keep it going.
And let’s keep going safely on our highways as well.
We‘ve got more miles of highway than all of New England and New York combined.
And I don’t like what I’m seeing out there.
We’ve got to work to keep our highways safe.
Safe for drivers and passengers.
And safe for the workers who help us make our highway system the most improved in the country.
Would it surprise you that more PennDOT workers than state troopers were killed on ourhighways during our time in office?
True.
And it’s unacceptable.
With your help, we will do better.
Pennsylvanians must have access to quality health care, no matter where they live or what their income.
Our smaller cities and rural communities face special challenges to the viability of their hospitals.
The time has come to build locally driven plans for the future role of each hospital in its community.
To this end, we will hold a series of six regional health-care summits.
By the end of June, we’ll know the problems facing our hospitals, and make sure no community is left out when it comes to health care.
At the end of last year, I asked you to make medical-malpractice reform your top priority.
By now, we all know there’s no quick fix.
We have to find meaningful, long-term solutions to the rising cost of malpractice insurance.
Whether it involves medical issues or legal ones, the important thing is to make sure Pennsylvanians have access to good health care now, and in the future.
I know you’re working in that direction, and I thank you.
There were no easy choices in preparing this budget.
But we will not balance this budget on the backs of low-income Pennsylvanians who need basic health care.
We will not cut benefits at a time when this vulnerable group can least afford it.
We had to consider holding off on this vital coverage.
But it’s too important to wait.
So we’ll begin Adult Basic Coverage this summer instead of the spring, a short time after its original start date.
That’s the adults.
Now let’s talk about the kids.
No time is more important in the development of children than the years before they ever set foot in a school.
So I am pleased to announce an expanded commitment to school readiness with more than a $23 million investment in children and child care.
The new “Keystone Stars” initiative will spur the professional development of child-care providers across the state.
And to see to it that our “Pre-K” classrooms improve and shine, we’ll set in motion a Special Task Force on early childhood learning.
Their findings will help us ensure that Pennsylvania’s pre-school children are healthy, safe and ready for their first day of school.
And I’ll proudly look to my successor to use their seminal work, and complete the job.
This budget invests $9 billion in education.
And that’s $2 billion more than Pennsylvania spent on education than when we came to town in 1995.
One of our most significant achievements is the Empowerment District.
And here’s how we can make it even better.
Empowerment Districts have helped Pennsylvania’s struggling school districts meet the needs of their students by boosting resources and raising the bar on achievement.
We’ve seen it work quickly.
Not far from this Capitol, in the Steelton-Highspire schools, students, teachers and parents have rallied to improve their schools.
But what happens to the kids who live in a high-rated district, but attend a low-rated school?
They are shut out from the benefits of the empowerment concept.
So, today I propose that we create “Empowerment Schools.
This investment provides assistance on a building-by-building basis.
We’ll identify specific schools where half or more of the kids are failing reading and math.
Then we’ll provide them with new tools and resources.
There are nearly 50 such schools across the state, in cities like Pittsburgh, Reading and Erie.
We’ll see to it that no child slips through the cracks.
And it will bring Pennsylvania closer to meeting our President’s national goal of leaving no child behind.
Sadly, that’s been the case much too often at Pennsylvania’s largest public school system.
The Philadelphia School District has, to a great extent, struggled to provide a quality education to its 215,000 Pennsylvania students.
Too many children cannot read or write.
Too many children never make it to graduation day.
Too many futures lost.
With your help, that troubling trend is changing.
Just before the New Year, Mayor Street and I reached agreement to launch the city and state on a new course.
one that will reinvent the seventh-largest school district in America.
By far, it is the most ambitious education-reform effort ever undertaken in this country.
I’ve been asked, “Why now, Governor?
You didn’t create the problems in Philadelphia.
Leave it for someone else.
The answer is simple.
I saw it in the faces of the children and the spirit of the teachers during a recent visit to Kearny Elementary School in the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia.
Let me take you there to meet Maggie Broderick and her second grade class.
Mrs. Broderick, the floor is yours.
**Thank you, class.
So back to the question, “Why now?” The answer is, it must be now.
Because if we don’t act now, history tells us that half of those precious second-graders won’t make it to their senior year.
And history tells us that a majority of children who do remain will eventually fall behind and fail reading and math.
But you know, those kids want to succeed.
We need them to succeed.
We need to help them succeed.
They’re our kids.
Our new partnership with the city has already seen the creation of a local School Reform Commission.
The five-member team is hard at work, moving quickly to prepare for September, and the finest opening day that district will enjoy in a generation.
So that we can deliver the kind of educational materials necessary to make that opening day a reality, I am asking this thoughtful assembly to approve $75 million in additional support for the children of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Combined with impressive, new dollars from the city and a commitment to real and sustained financial stability, we can make a big difference for thousands of Pennsylvania children.
Please see it as the right thing to do, and the right time to do it.
***Not far from here, along the Susquehanna, stands an historic marker on the site of the old Harris Ferry.
Centuries ago, from that point, tens of thousands of Americans crossed that great river, heading west.
Some chose to settle in Pennsylvania, while others moved through the Ohio Valley to the frontier beyond.
Imagine that journey.
Imagine how hard that must have been.
But on they went, because they were courageous people.
And they were decisive people.
They chose to meet the challenge of a vast, unexplored land.
They chose a new path and followed it.
And when they were through, they had created America.
They could have chosen to stay put.
They could have chosen the comfort of what they knew.
But instead they chose to clear a path for those who would follow.
Not because it was easy, but because it was hard.
We had hard choices to make in this budget.
We could have chosen the quick fix at the expense of the long-term solution.
We could have chosen the easy thing today, and left the hard things for those who would follow tomorrow.
We chose not to.
And so did John Kennedy.
You see friends, there was much more to President Kennedy’s profound remarks than I earlier let on.
Here’s how he finished: “We choose to do the hard thing,” he said, “because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept.
and one we are unwilling to postpone.
He meant it then.
I mean it now.
The terrorists may have altered the skyline of New York City, but they didn’t change the landscape of America or Pennsylvania.
We remain strong in our purpose and united in our resolve.
We accept the challenge, and we will not postpone it.
Together, over the next 11 months, we will make the choices we must, not because they are easy.
but because they are hard.
Thank you.
And God bless our Pennsylvania.
