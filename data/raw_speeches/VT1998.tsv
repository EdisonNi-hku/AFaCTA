Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the General Assembly, and fellow Vermonters: As I begin the seventh year of my governorship I want to share with you a new way of looking at the future of our state.
Change is a necessary part of the human condition, but today I want to put the changes that we will undergo in a new context.
I am asking you to look at these changes not only with short-term vision, but with twenty-year vision, and one-hundred-year vision.
Our short-term vision has to do with all the issues that we read about every morning in the newspaper or see at night on television.
These are the problems that must be dealt with by this legislature, by me, and by all public and private leaders every day.
The first of these is drunk driving.
We have had a drunk driving problem among teenagers and adults for a long time.
Other states and other nations have managed to effectively deal with drunk driving by taking bold steps such as confiscation of cars, lengthy imprisonments, and enormous fines for even the first offense.
For complicated reasons -- including the ambivalence among adults in our society about drug and alcohol abuse -- Vermont has not been successful in implementing these approaches to drunk driving.
I think it is time we begin.
We need forfeiture or immobilization of cars, serious and immediate sanctions for first time offenders, changes in the arrest laws to make it easier for the police to do their jobs, and video cameras in police cruisers.
I applaud the efforts of the Senate, and of the House Judiciary Committee to come up with a comprehensive solution, but I remind you that the attention of this state and its people is riveted on keeping multiple drunk driving offenders off the roads for long periods of time, if not forever.
Surely we can put these people in prison, but, since most of them are alcoholics, I submit to you that there must be a cheaper and more effective way to keep them off the roads.
Confiscation of cars is such a plan.
I proposed this last year and it did not pass.
This time I hope it will.
Today it is not uncommon for repeat drunk drivers to drive without licenses, and the penalties for this are minimal.
That must change.
Solutions like more police officers are worth exploring.
In fact, in the last month we have filled seventeen state trooper positions and my budget supports funding a Police Academy class for 12 additional troopers.
By the end of the year, the Vermont State Police will be at full force for the first time since the 1980's.
Furthermore, I ask for an additional $150,000 for safety vests for our first-response officers who put their lives on the line every day.
The Senate and the House Judiciary Committee have proposed other measures as well.
I will work hard with this legislature to pass a drunk driving prevention bill, but I insist that we focus very intently on our original goal: to keep repeat offenders off the road.
That is how we will make the drunk driving laws we have already on the books meaningful.
Besides adding sanctions, I am recommending an additional expenditure of $200,000 for prevention programs, particularly those which train teenagers not only to avoid the use of alcohol and other drugs, but to provide strength in their school communities to make it possible for those who wish to abstain to have stronger peer support.
This funding will expand projects such as the Green Mountain Teen Institute and the Green Mountain Prevention Project to 1,000 middle and high school students at 108 schools.
I will work closely with you and with the Health Department, which just received a $9 million dollar federal grant, to further our efforts to support prevention in our communities.
I remind you of this time one year ago when 18 family members of individuals who were killed or maimed by impaired drivers stood before you in the balcony.
Remember those faces.
Some of them are close personal friends of people in this room.
I ask you please to remember these friends in your deliberations.
Certainly the state budget is always an immediate concern.
Over the past six years we have worked together to put this state in the best financial condition it has ever been in.
I deeply appreciate the agreement that we have made with legislative leaders to limit budget increases to the rate of inflation through the Year 2000.
You may recall that in 1996 we calculated that if we held down spending to the rate of inflation, there would be enough money left over for three things: property tax reform, backfilling federal budget cuts, and establishing a budget stabilization fund equal to 5 percent of our annual budget .
What we thought would take four years, we have accomplished in two.
But the need for spending discipline continues.
Today I am presenting an overall 1999 state spending plan with 2.8 percent growth over Fiscal Year 1998.
This is the rate of inflation.
I am recommending a Fiscal Year 1999 General Fund budget of $753.4 million and a Transportation Fund budget of $163.6 million.
I seek to avoid the mistakes of the past where an unsustainable spending base was built only to be ripped apart to the detriment of many people who depended on state government during the terrible recession of the early 1990's.
We have reduced the state workforce by 450 workers to less than 7,000 employees, the lowest number of state employees since 1987.
We were fortunate not to have to lay anyone off.
I do not ever want to put Vermont in that position again.
I am asking for a budget which contains no additional taxes of any kind, and which continues to hold the line on positions for state government.
Because of our hard work these past six years, there will be extra dollars this year.
Today, projections are for a general fund surplus of $33 million.
In keeping with the wishes of the legislative leadership, and what I believe are the wishes of the majority of the members of this body, most of the surplus will be dedicated to making sure that Act 60 is a success and toward building a 5 percent reserve in the Education Fund.
I want to caution voters around the state that if you increase local spending substantially this year the tax benefits of Act 60 will be much smaller than what you have expected.
Furthermore, if you increase local spending on the schools consistently above the rate of inflation, Act 60 will serve only to equalize school opportunities.
It will not reduce property taxes in the long-term.
Excessive spending is the greatest threat to the success of Act 60.
Vermont taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a significant burden over the years.
If there continues to be is a surplus projected for 1999 that is sustainable over time, I will ask for a tax cut.
I believe we ought to cut taxes beyond the cutting we have already done in the property tax and the income tax.
I will have more to say about that later this month when the revised revenue estimates are available.
Another important part of a short-term vision is creating quality, sustainable jobs.
In the last six years we have created more than 30,000 jobs in Vermont.
Our unemployment rate is again approaching a record low.
This is good news, but it is not enough.
We have to work harder both to increase the wages paid to our working people, and to make sure that the creation of jobs does not lead to suburban sprawl.
We must continue to pursue legislation to promote our downtowns, not only as community centers, but as the hub of economic vitality.
Last year the Agency of Commerce and Community Affairs introduced a Downtown Development bill to provide strong incentives for the private sector to invest in downtown buildings and businesses.
Our goal is to create jobs which pay more and support strong communities.
This year I propose the following economic development incentives: An Economic Progress Payroll Tax Credit.
This would be a 5 percent tax credit for incremental investments in quality jobs.
A Research and Development Tax Program to promote entrepreneurial ventures.
This would be a 10 percent tax credit for the many talented, small business entrepreneurs who want to establish or expand their businesses in Vermont.
A Workforce Development Incentive Tax Credit of 10 percent.
A Vermont Export incentive that encourages Vermont-based commerce and increases tax revenue for the state.
A Small Business Investment Tax Credit good for a 5-to-10 percent credit toward plant and equipment investments exceeding $250,000.
In addition, our Downtown Development proposal includes incentives for infrastructure improvements.
Good economic development policy rewards sound business expansion and long-term investments that will encourage high-paying jobs.
To that end, I propose exempting from the Sales and Use Tax the following items: Materials used in certain manufacturing plant expansion and renovation projects; Major telecommunications equipment purchases; And investments in environmental systems.
I am recommending a $50,000 increase in the budget of the Small Business Development Center.
This program is critically important to help start-up ventures and existing businesses.
Small businesses in Vermont will account for most of our future job growth and we need to continue supporting their growth.
Vermont's farms are an integral part of our economy and contribute greatly to our communities.
It is in all of our interests to ensure that agriculture in Vermont remains strong and vibrant.
One of the most important things we can do now is support laws that strengthen the economic clout of dairy farmers, such as the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.
We must remain solid in our defense of the Compact against special interest groups.
The face of farming in Vermont is continuing to change.
We have become preeminent in the specialty foods market, a market that continues to grow.
In support of this growth and in order to increase support for value-added dairy products, I am asking for a 28 percent increase for the Department of Agriculture's marketing and development efforts.
Coordinating these efforts through the state Department of Tourism and Marketing will strengthen our unified presence in national and international markets.
If we are serious about job creation and better wages I must again ask the legislature to pass a comprehensive electric restructuring bill which will introduce competition and choice for Vermont consumers.
The memorandum of understanding negotiated by my administration with input from the low income community, the environmental community, and the utilities last year would have provided a stabilization of electric bills worth $238 million dollars to Vermonters over a five-year period.
I hope that this legislature will pass a bill to restructure our electric industry so that our consumers and our industries will be able to choose their utility.
We want industry, which pays better wages than the average Vermont wage, to be able to grow and prosper in Vermont.
Vermont has among the highest electric rates in the United States, and that makes it more difficult to bring good jobs here.
In terms of job creation we will have a number of items to place before the legislature that will result in better job training opportunities for Vermonters and for infrastructure improvement.
One component is an additional $200,000 to enhance the Job Training Program which will help make it possible for Vermonters to gain the skills they need to hold good jobs.
We are also introducing Vermont's first Tuition Assistance Program for the men and women of our National Guard.
I recommend a first-year appropriation of $250,000 for direct grants to Guard members seeking higher education opportunities within the Vermont State College system.
These are thing we need to do now, for today.
Now I want to talk about the things we need to do now, for the next generation -- our 20-year vision.
*********** Six years ago during the beginning of the budget crisis the Commissioner of Corrections came to me and asked for a 16 percent increase.
I told him that was impossible.
That this was a level funded budget and if I gave him a 16 percent increase in a program of that size I would have to cut something else even more to help balance the budget.
After negotiations and explanations we did increase the Corrections budget by 16 percent.
More violent felons are appropriately being convicted and sentenced to longer prison terms.
This year, again, the Corrections budget has sky-rocketed 14.8 percent.
This increase is necessary to reopen closed beds in the Woodstock facility, enhance field supervision of the increasing number of those not in institutions, and to support the creation of a 45-50 bed women's facility.
Now, prisons are an important investment because they do keep violent people off the streets and prevent them from victimizing others.
But of all the social service interventions that we do, prisons are probably the most expensive and the least effective.
Any qualified, competent kindergarten teacher can tell you who the five children in his or her class are who are most likely to end up in prison 20 years later.
The question I asked myself six years ago was, if we have some idea of who may end up in prison 20 years before they get there why aren't we doing something about it sooner?
With the help of this legislature we have put in place three extraordinarily important programs.
The first is welfare reform.
We were the first state in the nation to impose a work requirement and time limits statewide for welfare recipients.
We made it impossible to set up an independent household for minors who become pregnant.
A whole generation of Vermont children will now grow up in homes where work is the expected norm.
******************** The welfare reform bill that I signed into law four years ago has been extraordinarily successful.
Not only has the number of people receiving welfare dropped by nearly 25 percent, but, more importantly, we have increased by more than 51 percent the proportion of those remaining on welfare who now work.
Parents combining work and welfare are also earning more.
Increased earnings means people transitioning from welfare to work are less dependent on taxpayer-funded benefits and they are nearly always lifting their families out of poverty.
The next step in Vermont's welfare reform effort is to assist those who traditionally have the most difficulty entering the workforce.
My budget proposal includes $800,000 to match new federal dollars that will assist ANFC parents who have major barriers to employment to enter the workforce.
The second program is Dr. Dynasaur.
With the help of this legislature, we have guaranteed health insurance to nearly every child in Vermont.
I will ask that this legislature give us the authority to spend federal money this year to increase the Dr. Dynasaur income threshold so that we can insure children in families with incomes up to $48,000 per year for a family of four.
This is 300 % of poverty.
This program will be almost entirely paid for with federalmoney.
Once we achieve this level of coverage we will have the lowest number of uninsured children in the United States of America.
The third program is Success by Six.
We now offer home visits to 70% of all the children in Vermont within the first two weeks of their birth.
Through Success by Six, we are providing families with enhanced day care, nutrition and literacy programs, as well as education and support to help mothers and fathers become better parents.
I will ask this legislature to further expand Success by Six with an additional $150,000 appropriation to the Bennington County Success by Six program.
So far, the results of these prevention programs are stunning.
There's been a 20% drop in teenage pregnancy in the state of Vermont in the last 4 years.
While some other states have recorded a decline, none has been able to reduce teen pregnancy by the magnitude that Vermont has.
Even more spectacularly, physical abuse among Vermont children ages 0-to-6 has dropped 42 percent in the last six years.
And child sexual abuse victims ages 0-to-6 have declined 49 percent since 1991.
We believe there can be no other explanation for this except for the investments we've made in young children and their families.
We now have the capacity to find children and families who are in trouble when the child is just born, rather than when the child gets to school after 5 years of serious family problems.
Since abused children often become abusers as they grow older, this will have a positive effect on future generations as well as this one.
We can support these families and deliver services to them, and the short-term results have been both surprising and gratifying.
I hope today's 5-year-olds whose families will be helped by the Success by Six program, by Dr. Dynasaur and by welfare reform will become healthy 25-year-olds who ultimately head their own healthy families in the next century.
Our 20-year plan is a plan to save a generation: To change the way in which we deliver social services and move away from a model which has failed around the country.
This unsuccessful model calls for intervention after problems have started and this intervention is more expensive the older a child becomes.
The new model must rely on identification of at-risk families and voluntary intervention immediately upon birth, continuing that intervention to prevent problems before they've begun.
We must not forget that children become adults and adults who require services require the most expensive and the least effective interventions.
We have the power to change that in Vermont.
We are 5 years into a course of doing that, and I ask this legislature and subsequent legislatures to ingrain it in our institutional memory so that we do not fall backwards into the old patterns no matter what the economic status of our state.
Another aspect of the 20-year vision is transportation planning.
We now work more closely with town officials and regional planning commissions than we ever have on building projects that meet our communities' needs.
We now build and maintain roads, bridges, and bike paths to a Vermont scale that makes sense for our rural state.
I want to take a moment to congratulate the Agency of Transportation on its award last October from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for developing these Vermont standards.
And I want to thank federal transportation officials for their cooperation with our new standards.
I will recommend $1.1 million in the Budget Adjustment Act to be transferred from the General Fund to the Transportation Fund to fill that fund's reserves in Fiscal Year 1999.
I also recommend that $500,000 of the General Fund surplus go to help the Agency of Transportation to complete a number of salt sheds around the state.
Doing this will improve our environment by minimizing the likelihood of pollution of our ground water and surface water.
This funding will also support the State Infrastructure Bank.
There are other things that I will ask this legislature to do in transportation.
The most immediate is to improve Route 7 between Middlebury and Rutland.
This road has been the scene of a number of accidents, including a tragic fatal accident last spring.
I recommend adding limited access passing lanes to make this road safer, and we should make that our highest short-term transportation priority.
I will also ask this legislature to pay special attention to southwestern Vermont.
Four years ago I asked the legislature to agree to a plan to improve the Route 7 corridor between East Dorset and Rutland, and the legislature agreed to do so.
Pending the passage of a new ISTEA bill in Congress with increased federal money, I believe a fair share of that money ought to be spent in southwestern Vermont on projects such as the Bennington bypass, on Route 7 and on an Albany to Bennington to Burlington rail line.
This will bring more jobs to southwestern Vermont and, I believe, will be beneficial to the economy of the state as a whole.
This is also the year to begin work on the Circumferential Highway.
It would be impossible to talk of a 20-year vision without talking of the excellent work that has been done through the Lake Champlain Basin program.
With the hard work of our Congressional delegation, and many Vermonters as well as those from New York and Quebec, we have articulated a plan that will improve the quality of Lake Champlain's waters.
Through phosphorous reduction, reducing aquatic nuisances, and providing for education and research on and around the Lake Champlain basin, we will slow the eutrophication of this wonderful asset.
In the Capital Bill this year we are recommending $750,000 to continue the work of the Agriculture Department in helping farmers -- our most important custodians of the land and water -- conform to agricultural best management practices.
Our Capital Bill this year is $39 million, and a significant portion of that money is earmarked for improving water quality.
We've asked for more than $10 million in the Capital Bill to help towns improve their sewer and water capacities.
These investments will have a long-lasting effect both on our prosperity and on ability to create jobs, but also on the survival of Vermont's natural beauty.
The Lake Champlain basin model is being used by the Agency of Natural Resources with other watersheds in Vermont.
A similar plan is being developed for Lake Memphremagog.
Further, the Agency is working with the Windham Regional Commission to develop a watershed protection plan for the Deerfield and the West River.
I am recommending $200,000 for the Agency's environmental monitoring programs.
This will help us assess the environmental health of our soils, air and water so that we make sensible and efficient decisions about repairing and maintaining our environment.
Now, I ask you for a moment to consider what Vermont might look like in 100 years.
For those of you who are students of history, you know that many of the roads the Romans built laid out transportation pathways which exist 2000 years later.
You know that for better or for worse, the European countries which colonized Asia and Africa drew boundaries on those continents 150 years ago which will affect the lives of those who live there forever.
Similarly, decisions which we may make today, whether we use forethought or not, will have long-lasting implications.
Building shopping centers in farmers' fields for example, is one of those decisions.
I ask this legislature and those which will come after it to do something we do not do enough: to consider the impacts of our actions on the lives not only of our children or grandchildren, but of our children's grandchildren.
Today we live in a state which is within six hours driving distance of 65 million people.
Most of them love Vermont and many of them would like to own a piece of Vermont.
This prospect is wonderfully flattering and has helped us with our economic development.
Neither Husky nor IBM would be here today if it were not for our second home market.
But the possibility of unplanned developmental pressure changing our lifestyle forever is enormous.
I was asked at a recent meeting of the Windham Foundation what I thought the most serious problem in Vermont was likely to be over the long term.
The answer to that is one word While I have spent a great deal of time as governor encouraging more growth and more jobs, I also believe that unplanned growth in a booming economy will change the state forever in ways the vast majority of Vermonters will not support.
I urge you again to pass the downtown bill, not just for the benefit or our short-term jobs agenda, but as part of our 100-year conservation agenda.
If we allow sprawl to continue in this state we will lose our community and become an homogenized and undifferentiated part of our larger region.
While it is clear that our economy is deeply related to the rest of New England, and the rest of the world for that matter, we live in Vermont because we choose to live in communities which possess unique qualities that we value.
As we go through this legislature and subsequent legislative sessions, I ask you please to think of everything we do in terms of a short term-vision, in terms of a 20-year vision, and in terms of a 100-year vision.
This is why land conservation has been a major priority for me over the past six years.
This year I have transferred all of the funding for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust out of the Capital Bill and into the General Fund budget.
I am requesting a $500,000 increase over last year's funding level for a state contribution of $8.4 million.
The Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust is entering its 10th year of operation.
This program will leave a legacy that will, in one way or another, have an impact on the lives of all Vermonters.
Because of its dual mission of conserving land and providing affordable housing for Vermonters, more than 200 farms and their 66,000 acres of land will remain working farms.
Another 84,000 acres of natural areas, land for public recreation and working forests have been protected.
And, finally, 10,000 Vermonters are being served by 4,400 units of affordable housing either rehabilitated or constructed with assistance from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust.
Many of us take for granted the fact that we can walk or drive a short distance from our homes, no matter where we live in this state, and enjoy the outdoors.
The solitude of the woods, whether working in the woods or enjoying them for recreation, is never far away.
The ability to do that exists in very few places left in America.
I commend this legislature for setting aside $64.2 million over the last 6 years for land conservation and affordable housing efforts.
This has been a particularly difficult course during the worst years of the recession.
But our commitment has been essential to conserving our future and I hope this year's Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust appropriation will pass as well.
Since I have been Governor we have conserved more than 200,000 acres of land with the help of the private sector.
This land will always be available to Vermonters for hunting, canoeing, farming, hiking, timbering, snowmobiling and other activities which are so much a part of life in Vermont.
I thank our Congressional delegation, as well, for their outstanding leadership in support of land conservation.
Over the last five years, my children and I have canoed the entire 410-mile length of the Connecticut River through four states.
We have cooked fresh-caught bass over our campfire, heard loons in the black night, seen eagles and ospreys above us, and awakened to frost clinging to fiery maples in the fall.
We have delighted in finding rope swings along the shore where our children splashed and a few daring adults made fools of ourselves by reliving our childhood.
I want to thank the Agency of Natural Resources and Secretary Ripley, in particular, for negotiating just in the last 24 months alone the conservation of approximately 60,000 acres, including 33 miles of unspoiled Connecticut River shoreline.
With this agreement, we will have saved one of the most beautiful parts of this national treasure.
This privately owned land will continue to be used by Vermonters the way it is today for recreational use, and economic benefit, and it will remain as it is today for our children's grandchildren to enjoy.
I want to finish today by talking about the area of public policy which is at the top of my agenda for 1998.
The success of our public school system is both an immediate issue and a long-term concern.
While Act 60 has many technical ramifications, the concept is very simple.
Under the old system your taxes to pay for education were dependent on two things: one, the amount your community spends, and, two, the amount of property wealth in your town.
Most Vermonters with whom I have spoken agree that the old system was wrong.
Under the Supreme Court's order, no longer will the quality of a child's education be determined by the material wealth of a community.
The new system is much simpler and much fairer.
I have said that there would need to be some changes in Act 60.
I have proposed a number of changes and we must address issues such as technical education, special education and tuition costs, which we left for this year.
I thank the Legislative Oversight Committee for proposing necessary changes in the tax abatement provisions which I intend to support.
A number of towns have asked me to propose an early retirement program so that they would have more ability to manage their budgets.
I believe that is a fair request and if we are serious about local control being in this bill, we must approve an early retirement program effective in 1998, within the bounds of what is possible for Vermont's taxpayers.
1999 will be too late.
I also believe Act 60 makes it too hard for a handful of Vermont communities to adapt to the new funding system without hurting their schools.
We should, therefore, use a small portion of the surplus money which is going into Act 60 to help ensure that school systems remain strong and improve in all Vermont towns throughout this transition year.
We must not let these changes in our education system divide us.
Vermont is still one community and we are all responsible for the education of each others children.
There are more changes in education ahead of us.
We need to continue our vigorous efforts to ensure the long-term survival of our public school system and to make sure that parents have confidence in that school system.
Act 60 is not the end; it is simply the beginning.
I applaud the State Board of Education for putting in standardized school testing in the core subjects.
This year, for example, Vermont will be a national leader in assessing the reading skills of all of its second-graders.
This will provide each school an early warning to alert teachers and parents when students get off to a poor start.
We will rank all schools relative to the percentage of students who meet high standards in the fourth, eighth and tenth grades, and those results will be available to every citizen of Vermont.
As a result, we will have the ability to make judgments about the successes and failures of our schools and changes that must be made to improve them.
I have recently learned that 13 of Vermont's 60 public schools do not offer Advanced Placement courses of any kind.
An additional 12 Vermont high schools offer only one or two of these courses that provide opportunities for our most motivated and successful students to earn college credit.
Vermont's children deserve better.
This legislature has earmarked more than $1.5 million for distance learning equipment in the last three years.
Even if a school couldn't afford an additional teacher, Advanced Placement courses are available by satellite and cable.
This is one of several areas where we can and should do better.
The remedy, however, is not more regulations such as requiring schools to offer these courses.
Competition will do what regulation has failed to do.
The remedy is to empower parents and children to choose their own public schools.
The passage of Act 60 will remove the biggest barrier to public school choice, and that is lack of equity.
I now call on this legislature to work with me to craft a public school choice bill.
Such a bill will enable parents to choose more options inside their schools and to choose a different public school altogether, if they wish.
Public school choice is in effect in other states around the country.
Only a small percentage of parents use it.
But, in three-quarters of the communities in Vermont, parents who are dissatisfied with their public school, either have no option or have the option of private school only if they are financially able.
I believe that any parent in Vermont should be able to send their child to the public school of their choice.
This has the effect of allowing the 3-4% of Vermont parents who would take advantage of that to stay in the public school system and support the public school system.
Of far greater advantage, however, is the fact that the remaining 96% of Vermont parents then would have made an affirmative choice to stay in the neighborhood public school.
Choice invests people.
In order to have parents fully invested in public schools, they must participate in every way, and one of those ways means being able to choose for their child what they believe to be the most appropriate education in the context of the public schools.
My background as a physician, and the urgent way in which I took over this governorship led me to make jobs, balancing the budget and meeting the needs of small children and their families my major priorities.
Now we must focus intensely on what happens to children after the age of 5, as well as in their earliest years.
The public institution which most affects their lives is the public school.
I believe public schools are what made this country great.
They are the foundation of our democracy, the one place where we all learn about each other, regardless of income, religion or race, the one place where, more often than not, the diversity of our wonderful communities and the diversity of the enormous and wonderful country is reflected in the faces of our children.
There will be many ideas on how to make the public schools better.
I submit to you that the old formulas of more money, more regulation, and more rigidity will result in the eventual dissolution of the public school system.
In order to survive over time, public schools must change.
We must have more choice, we must have more competition, we must have more accountability.
We do need to work hard this session for our short-term goals: getting repeat drunk drivers off the road, better job opportunities for Vermonters, and continued sound fiscal management.
I have no doubt we will.
We need to work this session toward our 20-year goals: healthy, well-loved children able to live in a world with quality schools, clean air and water, and a transportation network that promotes better jobs and less sprawl.
I know we can do that.
Every action we take has a 100-year effect.
This year we will make commitments to preserve our working farms and our forests, to build our transportation network, to support downtowns and plan our growth.
If we do our job, our children's grandchildren will be able to live in the same caring and beautiful Vermont we live in today.
Thank you very much.
