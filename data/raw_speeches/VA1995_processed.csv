SENTENCES
"Good evening, my fellow Virginians.Thank you for tuning in."
"As you may have heard by now, the General Asembly was unable to organize itself to receive the traditional State of the this evening."
"So I'm speaking to you from the Govemor's omce, whQ so many important decisions have been made that charted the course of this geat Commonwealth."
I reckon the folks in the Legislature will get things straightened out one of these days.
But don't be surprised if you see more <unts like this to defeat my plan to let you and other hard-working Virginians keep more of the money you earn.
"The auth is, I'd rather talk to you anyway."
Because this is your govemment.
"And, you how, things would go a whole lot more around this if people would just keep that in mind."
"My fellow Virginians, if there is a metaphor for moment in hi<ory, it isfound in Robert Frost's well-known poem, The Road Not Taken."
"There, he describes a aaveler who pauses at a fork in the road and, insead of choosing the well-wom path, summons the courage to take the less-traveled, but more promising cot-use."
"Tonight, it is clear — we, too, stand at a fork in the road Two CONTRASTIING VISIONS The General must come to terms with two contrasting philosophies — two conflicting v#ioms — of govemment should do, and what are the rights and responsibilities of ciüzens."
"Will our state continue down the path of bigger government, increased spending and taxes, deepening dependency and declining values?"
"Or, will we make government analler and more focused on core governmental duties — allowing you to keep more of your hard-earned money?"
"Some have eid that this will make this Sesion of the General Assembly competitive.So may, and so it has."
"But if it is to be contemious, let it also be enlighten."
"ing for the people of when we meet in ffe markeplace of ideas and debate our principles and policies with civility and mutual respect, we provide you all, the people, with a clear choice."
And choice is the lifeblood of represenütive demoaacy.
"This evening, I am going to talk about the principles that are the foundation of the Allen ideas for cutting uxes and govemment pending, reforming education and wefre, and creating jobs."
I want to focus on the fork in the road before us these two contrasting visions of govemment and wciety — because it is this fimdamental question that will shape for Virginians the present and future üte of our C. omnÜnwealth.
"GOVERNMENT As GUARAM'OR Gle — the ""big government knows best"" — held sway in America for much of the last 30 years.It is an elitist vision."
"It assumes that the common sense and üaditional vdues of regular folk are not adequate to the task of running their own lives, mmilies and It regards individuals and private institutions as secondary and subordinate to govemment bureaucracies profesünal politicians."
"Decades of govemment based on this philosophy have brought us — — stifling regulation and burdensome taxes, — mediocre education and declining job opportunities, excuses for criminal behavior, — and a welfare-Nate mentality ffat has taught a generation of Americans to depend on others for what we want, and to blame others for what we lack This misguided experiment with govemment-guaranteed happiness has epped ffe Qirit and uidermined the values of the American people."
It has done what no foreigl enemy could it has robbed many of our citizens of their ilMiependence and their dignity.
"VIRGINIA'S FAILED For a long time here in Virginia, we resi<ed the national infatuation with big govemment."
"Republicans and conservaüve Democrats togaher on a pecific, well-defined and limited role for Sate government."
They fiscal It took Commonwealth two centuries — two cenuries to reach its first $10 bülion biennial budget.
"But in the 15 years, gate spending has Dipled, and the budget now exceeds $32 billion."
"Even the recent recession years when the private economy was shrinkng, total üe spending did decrease.It has grown each year."
"By any comparison, the budget gowth in Virginia during the last decade has been excessive."
State qending has gown more thzl the gowt.
"h in population, more than the growth of personal income, and more than the mte of inflation."
It has grown even faster than federal government spending.
"fact, over the 10 years, üte govemment qending in Virginia has increased at nearly nvice the mte of federal spending."
What do you — the people of Virginia — have to show for the billions of your ux dollas eate govemmelt has pent during the last decade?
— Students' test scores have shown no improvement.
— College tuition has risen until we took omce.
— Jobs and invesunent have beel lost to neighboring gates.
"— And violent crime has skyrocketed, leading you to demand a complete and fundamental overhaul of our criminal juqice system."
My purpose here is not to blame.
"My point is that in area after area, what Virginians have seen recent years is their govemment spending more, but deliv±g les — less of the things that really matter, like good schools, efe streets, more and better jobs."
"A NEW ERA VIRGINIA My fellow Virginians, the ""big govemment"" path has failed us."
And you have demanded a new drection.
"But, yal and I must convince ffe General Assembly that the time to act is now!"
"A year ago, I was elected by clear-thinking Virginians who sent a very direct and compelling mesege — — Cut wasteful, bureaucratic spendng.— Lower taxes."
Reuce the and reach of govemmenL And make Stae govemment more encient and more effective in meedng us essential responsüilides.
A significant aspect of this new direction and new viSon Virginia is our plan to cut by $2.1 billion and reduce unnecessaor govemment spending.
My proposal cuts the State income tæ Why?
"Because income ux is a tax on work, a on productivity, a tax on md self-reliZ1ce."
"Otr plan friplß the personal dependent exanptions over the next five years — providing a meaningful tu cm for evay working Virginian, but epecially benefitting middle- and lower-income working families with children."
"During the ""big-govemment"" experiment of the lag these have been the forgotten Virginians — the people like you who work hard, who pay their taxes, who obey the law, who try to provide for their and teach decent values to their children."
You are the people who are carrying the heavy load — the folks who been ignored while out-of-touch and organized pecial intere<s dennnded more and more of your hardæamed money.
We hear the excuse that other to the north of us have a higher total ux burden than Virginia's.
"Well, my response is this: If Members of the General Assembly find that fact somehow — if they really believe Virginians are not taxed enough — then I reckon they will vote agains my tax cut proposals."
"But for those legislators who care about helping working mmilies, the — Virginia's individual ux burden, per capita, is among the top third in the cotmtry."
— Virginia's personal exemption is the second worst in the Nation.
"When our ux cut plan is fully implemented, a Imrried couple with two children and a federal adjusted gross income of $40,000 will get a 27 percent net cut in their current Virginia income tax."
"A typical mmily of four earning $24,000 a year will have their sate income ux burden cut in half."
For a single parent with two children eam.
"ing $15,000, my plan will reduce the üte income tax gab by more than two-thir& Under our tax cut plan, up to 84,000 low-income, workng Virginians will no longer be required to pay any <ate income taxes at all!"
I also have proposed to increase job opportunities for Virginians by out a ux that is broadly achowledged as a job Eller — tlE deqised goss receipts ux.
"'IYs regösive tax falls hardest on busneses, eqecially æw md enterprises."
"In mct, it is levied even on those that have not yet begrm to ttm a nie men Zid of are die backbone of orr economy."
Many more Virginia families have a paycheck this evening because of a enall bl±ess employer than any other End.
"If we want our fellow Virginians to have die financial sectrity Zid that comes wmr that paycheck, if we want Virginia to be a competitive <ate in which to do business, then it makes absolutely no sense to hold back small businesses and cripple others with a regressive tax on åeir gross receipts."
really are two different philosophical visons in conflict here.
"Gle viSon proceeds from the assumption that income belongs to åe govemment, that the govemment should collect through various devices as much uxes as the people will permit, and that it is üze govemment's job to redistribute the ta."
xpayers' money in ways politicians and bureaucrats think best.
Our new' begins from the opposite assumption.
I believe that taxpayerS belongs to the people who eamed and produced it.
You krow better than any govemment omcial how beg to use it!
"Unlike die ""big-govemment"" approach, our new places a value åe independence and self-sufficiency of the individual.It recogni."
zes that a dollar kept by the who eamed it is far more valuable than any dollar handed out by the govemment.
The dollar you earn yourself and keep is a reward for your effort.
It's an incentive for work the future.
It preserves the crucial connection between diligence and success.
The dollar that govemment takes away and gives away has the opposite effect.
"My fellow Virginians, your demand for Eaner, more effcient govemment, and tax cuts for lower- and middle-income families and snall businesses is a defining issue understood by people all across the country."
It is undersood even in Congress by Republican and Democrat leaders.
And it's even understood now by the White House.
We can only hope that folk on both of die aisle in Virginia's General Assembly undergand the power and the impoünce of ux cuts for working Virginia families.
"PEOPLE'S PRIORITIES Timing to other areas of the budget, the amendments I have proposed will increased funding in this biemium for your people's top prioHties the govemment's primary responsibilities — education, law enforcement and job creati01L At the eme time, it achieves savings by reducing the of cenaal omce and by decreasing oending on activüies that carmot be juÄified as essential for Virginia's uxpayers to pay."
"For ever item in the budget, I asked two key — First, 'Is this activity, DO bow wen-intentioned or entrencbed; is it essenüal for Nate government and uxpayers to provide?"
"• — And second, •Is this activity more importOit than a tax cut for an of Virginia's working and sman businesses — or otber priorities the ciüzens have in law enforcement, education and job creation?"
"This evening, three families traveled from different regims of Virginia to see their General Asembly in acion."
"Tiose mmilies — the Morgan's, the Pittman's and the Fritis — are here my office tonight insead."
"as I did, General Asembly members will have to decide for themelves: Is spending nearly $100,000 a year to opente a yacht more important than a ux cut for like Tom and Sharon Morgan?"
I sided with the Morgan's who are from Virginia and have just put three children through college.
"spending 25,000 taxpayer dollars to buy plaques for a fishing toutiEment more important than allowing families like A1 and Teresa Pittlnan's to keep more of thü hard- eamed money?"
"I chose the tax cut for A1, a Noffolk policeman, and Teresa, a h0ZEmaker, because they are <ruggling to raise their four children."
"And, Is spending 120,000 of taxpayer dolla."
rs researching the merits of additional trees in cities more important than reducing the tax burden on Virginians like Demis Alice Fritz?
"I decided my priority was Dennis, an insurance agent, and Alice, an elementary school tacher, Southwest Virginia.The Fritis are %qki."
ng hard to for their three little girls.
Trese are real working families.
"If the Members of the General Asembly these and hard-workng families during this Session, then they catainly agree with me that the taxpayers of Virginia åould be our pdority."
"There is room in the budget to reduce unnecessary bureaucmic oending, and provide a tax cut — not to these three mm."
"ilies — but to all Virginians, epecially thoe working mmilies with children."
Were all the budget decisions easy choices with obvious answers?No.
"But, I made my decisions based upon the fundamental philosophy tlEt people k)0W better how to pend their hard-eamed money than does govemment."
Our primary responsibility is to do what's right for an citizens of this great Commonwealth.
Our obligation is not to perpetuate an ever-increasing and ever-growing government.
"My fellow Virginians, our new viSon of a leaner, more effcient govemment is achievable if we embrace the Foven principles of the private sector."
"Thafs why I my govenment refom effort a yar ago by aeating a Blue Ribbon Seike Force mo<ly of luders from ou&de of government Some of their recommendations to illQase emciency, improve cusomer service, and reduce ffe of govemment will come before the General Assembly this SesSon."
"example, last my Adminisration consolidated certain functions at the level, thereby reducing wideqread duplication of those functims in die various agencies."
"As a result of this action and greamlining efforts, my Secræries were able to eliminate 14 posiäonsfor every new one they created For some reason, some the Geneml Assembly are opposed to diis common sense, co<-saving Recent efforts by our Rate colleges and tmivemities are anmher ex—e of increased emciency."
By reducing overhead and eliminating low-priority our public inÄitufions of higher education can hold the line again< Seep tuiüon hikes.
And we can improve the overall quality of education provided to studenG.
My budget proposals also auåorize a 2.25 percæxt *lary inaease — and up to a 4.55 percen one time performance bmus — for all State employees.
"Btn we have funded these increases with existing agency resources, so employees will become active prtners in our efforts to identify ineffciencies and conÜol cos in gate govemment — because they now have an incentive to do so and will be rewarded for looking out for you, die owners of Virgi.nia's govemment."
"In tranqortation, I am commined to protecting die integrity of the transportation aust funds and ensuring that we invest wisely to meet the mobility needs of a vigorous and growing Virginia."
"In fact, our budget initiatives make $86 million in additional funding available for actual construction needs."
The fimds were generated — by jacking up gas taxes — but by increased economic activity and through ereamlining and cost-cutting efforts.
We can spplement public resources with private And I urge the General Assembly to adopt the bipartien legislation tim we have developed du.
i. ng the past year for *c-private tranQ01tation projects.
"MoÄ of dl, Ws dme to look to the private sector for economic development job creatiom For the first ince years, our now a comprehen."
sive economic development <rategy.
"It reflects the combined wisdom, just of a few govemment planners Richmond, but of over 800 men and women, and community local govemment leaders from across Virginia These dedicated citizens helped us develop our Opporunity Virginia initiative."
We can make Virginia a leader again in ffe competition new jobs.
"We can do it by re-focusing our economic development resources and using them in partnership wml the private sector, by unshackling free enterpris md on regulatory policies based on sound science, and by leaving $2.1 billion in the private sector."
"We can make Virginia a peat place to ülve<, do buS.nes and cre& jobs."
"A NEW PARTNERSMP Wrm Locurms As we embrace the people's viSon of leaner, more effcient and more accouxtable govemment at all levels, we muq forge a new partnership between the local governments in Virginia."
"Before I became Govemor, unfimded on localities were commonplace."
"To that, I said drat I would veto any unfunded mandates die Legislature sent me.That's what I did."
And I prepared to fonow drough on that commiünem this year.
"Despite the imperative of downsizing gate govemment aid our demands for ux and spending reductions, my budget propoel."
s provide more than a 13 percent increase state aid to localities over this biennium.
"And I propose to eliminate the job-killing goss receipts ux, not by leaving localities high dry, but by cutting <ate spending in order to replacement This conmitment extends to each of the budgets I will submit as Govemor."
"And, as I have üted before, if the General Assembly sends me a bill that continues replacement funding for the goss receipts tax beyond the nem five years, I will be pleased to SiPi it."
"When it comes to tkE state and local relationship, I am interested in burden-shifting.I am committed to cog-smügs."
I am not interested in switching I'm committed to taxes!
"The new parmership I envision is one in which local govemments are free from unfi-mded mandates and share equitably in available revenues so they, too, can focus on the people's priorities, reduce the size and coS of govemment, and work for a thriving and prosperous economy."
"FROM WELFARE TO WORK Along with cutting taxes and reducing spending, there are other essential building block in the solid fotmdation for our new era of freedom, and re»onsibility in Virginia.One is welfae reform."
The Report of my Commission on atizen Empowerment is clear.
"Our current of welfare in Virginia is an undeniable Instead of creating opportunity, it fo<ers dependency."
"Instead of helping more Virginians enter productive jobs, it entices more Virgi."
nians to remain idle and rely on govemmem.
"hstead of families, it break åmilies apart."
It takes more and more away from worHng taxpayers.
"And, at the eme time, it teaches us to expect les and les of the inqituüons that traditionally have held communities together — mmilies, churches, synagogues, charitable and civic organizations and c&en volunteers."
Tre welfare reform legislation I will submit this Session reflects orr new of oppormnity md independence.
It is a statewide plan to replace welfÜe with work Able-bodied citizens will no longer receive benefits tmless they are willing to work for them.
And even this will be temporary.
"Since the objective is independence, our new program is desiY1ed to get people of of the welfare rolls and into productive, private Ector jobs."
The only way to make that happen is to place a limit — I pmpose a two-year limit — on welfare benefits for able-bodied recipients.
I am well aware that there are those who ae physically and mentally unable to provide for themselves for reasons beyond ffeir control.
And we will certainly continue to make govemment assistance available to thern.
But we must reject the misguided notion that it is somehow compassionate for government to do for people what they are capable of doing for themselves.Personal responsibility.Self-reliance.Individu.l initiative.
"'lheæ are the common sense, pincipled ideas that guide our welfare reform proposals — common sense, yet revolutionary ideas at this moment time because a completely different vision has guided orr social welfare policies for fir too long."
"RENEWING VOLUNTEER SPIRrr We must understand that govemment is only part — and, in ü•uth, only a gnal."
l part — of the real solution to our social needs.
"Before big government made us dependent on its largese, diere were grong institutions üiat asumed reponsibility for addressing these needs."
"One in ffe fight to re€nergize ffese in<itutions, to re<ore our sense of community, and to rekindle our Qirit of volunteerign is Richmond Mayor, Lee Young."
"In this capital city wracked by violære, he has challenged citizens to Sop poinfrig fingers and gart inve<ing themselves in the renewal of their community — nd not as subservient taxpayers, but as free citizens tmited for the commm good."
ne reqonse has beel tremendous.
"I am eqeciaily pleased that Mayor Yotmg and Anna Lee of Fairfax County have agreed to lead gatewide effort — krown as *Volunteer Virginia"" — to enlis our citizens in ü:rvroving their communities and helping those need.I how Virginians will respond."
"STRENGTHEN(NG FAMILIES As we seek a renewal of private action to improve our communities, we also mug change the way govemment treats the most importmt private üi<itution — the family."
I have already discussed our most urgent task: We relieve dre financial pressures on worldng Virginia mmilies by reducing the tax burden cn those who are Rising chil&en.
But there is more to it åan that.
"When government policies are designed around the asumption that parents will not be reqmsible, it becomes a self-fulfilling prop}rcy."
We muq recognize that parents have the right — and the responsibility — to guide the deve10Bnent of their children.
this Sesion of the General Assembly — — I will propose meastres to Üenghen our ability to e«ablish patemity and enforce child support obligations.
"Specifically, I propose to: deprive ""dead-beat"" mthers of their driving except to work; and, hold parents of fathers under 18 financially liable for child support, if the minor ather is unable to meet his obligatiorr."
— I will ask the Legislature to parenul die ensitive about abortion md sex education for minors.
— And I will seek legislation requiring young welfare recipients to live with a paent or legal guardian as a condition of receiving temporary assi<ance.
"The decline of the family has many devasating consequences, but none is more alarming fran the rapid growth in juvenile crime."
"We must meet this challenge squarely, with compassion, but also with firm resolve."
"During the coming year, Attomey Geneml Jim Gilmore will, at my reque<, cha."
"ir a gubernatorial commission that will address the presing problem of inaeased juvenile crime and offer specific AcAPEMIC EXCELLENCE Our hope for die lies in families It also lies in quality educaion I firmly believe t. lnt more decisions about education mug be made at the community level, where parents have an effective voice in the decisions åat affect die schooling of üeir chüdren."
"In the past, education policies have eddied local govemments wüh unfunded mandates, empowered the bureaucracy here in md focused social consultant fids rather than on basic, academic fimdamentals."
"Today, the most esential reform needed in public education is a retum to high academic sandards in the basics of Fngli«h, science, math and hisory."
"les than three weeks, my Superintendent of Public Instructicn, will present to the Board of Education a comprehen."

"These igorous academic <andards have been developed through tmprecedented cooperation betweal local public school teachers, üte offcials, and the diverse and dedicÜd citizens serving on my axznpion Schools Commisiom This is the first in a proces that will give these high <andards the force of regulations."
It will measure <udent pefformance agains thee gandards through regular teüg and provide a mean.
ingful system of accountability and on academic achievement.
I also will ask the General Asembly to embrace the charter school concept.Ehools are public schools.
"Garter Ehools encourage creativity and competition within the public school by local school boards to conmct with myone, from teachers, to nearby colleges, to busineses — all to the academic proficiency of eudents."
"As I see it, chmter schools are an additional tool for use by local communities, not something to be imposed from Richmond.my legislation will amr."
re üiat charter-granting decisions must have local support and that the State Board of Education cannot override a local decision.
"I also will propose that we make <atutory — and therefore permanent — the program of targeted aid to at-risk *udents in the ""disparity"" plan that we began year."
"However, this program will be incentive-based, and ui0ther utfunded on local public school systems like the bills I was forced to veto laq year."
"Finally, it accomplishes very little to talk about high academic undards when fear our schools, and teachers spend valuable class time dealing with diguptive gudents."
"is high time to elQower our dedicated and conscientious teachers, ard to them take chuge of thü classrooms without fear of reprisal or lawsuits."
"I wm Nibmit legislation to pant teachers immunity from liability for die actions they may take to discipline or assist students, and maü1ü order in their classooms."
"Taken togaher, in light of åe ovemll ürcrease education pending budgeted for this our educüion initiatives reflect a new vision of academic excellence, accountability, parental involvenænt, community Efety, Zid a solid commiment our dedicated teachers."
These initiatives offer hope for real educational improvemen after years of high-cost experimermtion and unfulfilled promises.
"REBIRTH OF FEDERALISM Jus as we seek to empower parents and local communities through education md other reforms, so, too, mug we on the decentralizafion of power from Wßhington Otr goal is to bring closer to the people."
"And, in pursuing this objective, nothing could be more encouraging than the Qirit of change sweeping the new Conges."
"For the first time in lifetimes, there is not only the posibility, but the that pestering federal interference ard federal mandates on <ate local goverments will be pared back and, in some cases, elimi.nated altogether."
"Of course, we camot eand by and wait for this change."
We mug defend Virginian's rights md prerogatives.
"That's exactly what Attomey General Gilmore I did on Monday, when we went to court to challenge die constitutionality of the dicntes of the Environmental Protection Agency."
But the good news is that we are no longer in this alone.
"In November, I hoged a second revolutionary gathering in Colonial Williamsburg."
"Tiere, a majority of the Naüon's governors gathered, md we åe newly elected congressional leadership to join us."
"Together, we are charting a direction for country — away from the failed approach of cenüalized power in Wa."
"shington, and to ffe founders' design of a üue federal system of shmed powers and dual sovæignty."
What this can mean for us here in Virginia is nothing than a rebirth of freedom — a &nce to chart our own cotrse as a free Commonwealth — a chmce for our citizens to conüol their own destiny by makng at the community level.
"I call on the General Assembly to seize this unique opportunity and issue a ringing bipanisan endorsement of this new vision of federalism and self-determination, including participation the hisoric Conference of the Stmes to be held later this year."
"Let us join together, as Virginians did two centuries ago, and lead åe way to federal con<itutional reforms that Guly can make freedom the la<ing legacy of our land."
TRUSTING THE PEOPLE These times of change also challenge us to our ow•n fundamaltal law — our conÄitutional &ter — so that you have a direct voice in the unagement of your affairs the Sate level.
If the General Assembly truly embraces new vision of freedom — if trey ü•ust åe people I do — üien they must undergand that initiative and is an idea whoe time has come.
It is high üme to give Virginians this baSc right to direct the cotrse of their govemment.
"And while we are on the subject of referenda, let me reiterate my support for a general obligation bond isue this fill to ad&ess prison needs associated with the abolition of parole."
"Certül capital projects unrelated to the impact of math-in-sentencing legislation require immediate However, we can — and I believe we should — give the people of Virginia an opportunity to this November on the fi."

"MAKING PROGRESS TOGVI'UWR My fellow Virginians, we have many challenges before us."
Some will ey we cannot meet them in a bipartisan fashion.But I we cm.
"Some eid we could not abolish our lenient, deceitful parole syqem and bring truth-in- sentencing to Virginia.But we did."
Some Eid we could not achieve a 6ir and equitable of the lmg<and.
ing tax diqute with federal retirees.But we did.
Some we could not increase finding for the education of &risk Sudents without forcing an unfimded mandate on localities.
But we We also worked together and succeeded in our ethics laws and removing the cloud over the Virginia Retirement SyÄem.
And we helped make college education more affordable for more Virginia families by holding tuition growth to the mte of in.flation — about 3 percent.
Few thought we could compile such a remcöle record of accomplishment.But we toge.her and we achieved much.
We now tun in frat same coqemive Qirit to the issues that be placed before the I. egislmure this Sesim.
"In preparing this budget, I had to make many tough and Inrd &ices."
"Now it is for members of the General Asembly to choose — the <ultifying ütus quo, or invigorating new en of freedom, opportunity md reponsibility for you, the people of Virginia."
Already ome are eying we cannot on such a journey.
But you — ffe people of Virginia — have set compass.You want us to succeed.
"And you BY, ""We can and we mast!"""
CONCLUSION All of these changes will require v&on and courage.
"I it is easy for some politicians to lisen to the demands of intereS goups and even some well-meaning citizens who jus absolutely convinced ffat, while all those other progn."
"ms are waseful, their project is absolutely But there is a choice to make.Ihe road before us diverges."
"T ike Frost's traveler, we can see one path ffat is well-Eaveled and easily followed."
But it dieppears into a dark thicket of dienoinment dependency.The ot.her path is less traveled.
But it leads us out of the dull shadows of medioaity and into die bright Nmshine of botmdless horiz.ons and limitles posSbility.
"IA us set about this course of reform with character, courage and resolve."
"Sometimes, when I li<en to political figures ulk boldly about reform thal under fire from the entrenched special intere<s, I am reminded of the Union com."

"Well, let me tell you all omething I am not going to run!"
"I made my decision a year ago, when üle people of Virginia gave their tru<, frat I was going to fight — and keep fighing — for the changes I promised you and the principles in which I believe."
I ask you to eand and fight along of me.
Fight for the honest change that you have demanded.
"Fight for the right of people who work hard and play by the rules to keep more of what they have eamed, and to raise your families as you see fit."
Fight for a new that c&ens to uke cae of themselves and Fig.

Our proud heritage is leadership.
"So let us in govemment, therefore, rise above partisanship, pecial intere<s aid politics-as-usual."
"With faith in ourselves, mith in ach other, and hith in our Ceator, let us now Üive for something bener."
"For a change, kt government do not what is convenient for government let government do what is right for you — the taxpayers of Virginia."
"Thank you, have a good evening."
