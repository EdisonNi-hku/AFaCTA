To Utah’s public servants gathered here tonight and my fellow Utahns: Welcome.
Our time together this evening is brief — indeed our time in public service is brief — so I will forgo many of the formalities of this setting.
Although a departure from custom, I would ask you to hold applause until the end as we examine together the many critical issues facing our state.
For some of you, I know that holding applause won’t be hard.
You see, we have many important things to accomplish together.
Real work.
Hard work.
And I don’t want to waste a single moment.
It seems like nearly all we have talked about for the past two years is COVID.
And while we, along with the rest of the world, find ourselves in the middle of record cases and hospitalizations, there are a few silver linings.
I am encouraged that Utah currently has the 6th lowest hospitalization rate in the nation — and that our rate is less than half the national average.
Experts also believe that Summit County has already started declining and assure me that the rest of the state will soon follow.
We have tremendous medical and public health workers in the state who deserve our deep respect, support, and thanks.
That was true in early 2020 when the pandemic first began.
It is even more true today.
To Utahns from all sides of the political spectrum, there has been and will undoubtedly continue to be disagreements on how best to respond to this ongoing pandemic.
But may we all find common ground tonight on this one issue.
Our children need us to be strong.
They need us to point to a hopeful future.
And they need to be in school, in person, face-to-face with their friends and teachers.
To those teachers with us tonight, I know that you are on mile 42 of what was promised to be a 26.2 mile COVID marathon.
And while we can never thank you enough, I do believe that we can pay you better.
Thanks to the leadership of President Stuart Adams and many others, last year we made historic investments in our schools and teachers, $510 million in all.
This year we can do even more.
That’s why I am proposing more than $970 million in education funding with a priority focus on at-risk and disadvantaged students.
A child’s zip code should never determine their future or their opportunities.
This session I am also proposing the elimination of all school fees for the basic coursework required for graduation.
This legislation being drafted by Rep. Adam Robertson will save Utah parents $55 million each year, with many of those dollars going to Utah families struggling to meet essential financial obligations.
But money alone is not enough.
The data is clear — for far too many children an inability to read at grade level by 3rd grade means a life of struggle and disadvantages.
And that is why I am asking you to join me in supporting Sen. Ann Milner’s bill to make sure every child has the reading foundation necessary for future success.
One of the greatest challenges Utah families are experiencing today is the booming tax of inflation, which just recently hit rates not seen since 1982.
In Utah, we must be a bulwark against the bad decisions in Washington, DC that are harming our people.
Because of critical decisions we made together during the pandemic, and the incredible resilience of Utahns, our state is in its strongest fiscal condition ever with the largest rainy day fund, lowest unemployment and largest budget surplus in our state’s history.
Last year we delivered nearly $100 million in tax cuts for Utah seniors, military veterans and families.

Tonight, I encourage you to vote for bills carried by Reps. Robert Spendlove and Ray Ward to prioritize water storage and dramatically improve water conservation in our state.
And to Speaker Brad Wilson, you have always been a champion of thinking big and planning for the future.
I am proud to say in front of this body and the entire state that I am 100% committed to helping you accomplish your vision of saving the Great Salt Lake.
While water is the greatest limiting factor to our growth, there are several other pressing issues we must address including air quality, transportation, housing affordability and other infrastructure needs.
Our goal should never be to grow for growth’s sake.
We must prioritize a quality of life that all Utahns can enjoy.
To Utah’s newest residents — and as the fastest-growing state in America there are many of you — welcome to our beautiful state.
We are happy you have chosen to call this your new home.
We have so much to learn from you.
But, if I may make one small request: Please don’t attempt to change us into the place you just left.
Utah has maintained a high quality of life and abundant opportunity for our residents through practical, common sense governance and it is absolutely critical that all of us do everything in our power to keep it that way.
Legislators, this session I ask for your support of new bills spearheaded by Reps. Joel Ferry, Steve Waldrip, Joel Briscoe and Sen. Jake Anderegg to remove government regulations that needlessly increase Utah’s housing prices.
We can increase supply without decreasing quality of life.
This one will not be easy.
But we cannot let our state become California.
For the first time ever, people on the Wasatch Front are experiencing something that those of us from rural Utah have felt for far too long: the terrible realization that our kids and grandkids might not be able to live near us.
In rural Utah that happens because of a lack of jobs.
Along the Wasatch Front, it’s due to the unsustainable increase in housing prices.
We have to get this right.
We must act now.
And with the strongest economy in the nation, we have a generational opportunity to invest in infrastructure.
If the federal government is going to continue recklessly spending money borrowed from future generations, it is our duty to invest in projects that will benefit our children and grandchildren.

The concept is simple but revolutionary: In Utah we can create a new system focused on health, not health care.
In a new Broadway show, one of the main characters says this line: “Happy families only exist in orange juice commercials and Utah.
Tonight, I am proposing a new position that will make Utah parents and children its singular priority.
We currently have programs focused on providing necessities for families that are poor or in need, but we must do more to make sure families of all shapes and sizes and makeups are thriving, including parental leave, access to high-quality child care and mentoring opportunities for parents.
The purpose of this office is not to inject more government into families — it is the exact opposite: It is to make sure that government policies are not harming families and that we are coordinating government services to help parents and children succeed.
I firmly believe that Utah’s success in recent years can be directly attributed to our family-centric identity — and yes, that includes our nation-leading marriage and birth rates.
In fact, that has always been part of what makes Utah unique, strong, and resilient.
After decades of so-called experts warning the world about overpopulation, now the best and the brightest correctly cite a low and declining birth rate as a major risk facing human civilization.
But the risks to our society in abandoning the family are not just macro in scale.
This issue touches on the things that matter most in the world.
We know that the family, the basic and fundamental unit of our society, continues to be the most effective and least expensive place to solve problems.
When families are healthy and happy, society benefits.
And finally a brief word on election integrity.
Over the past seven years as your Lt. Governor, I championed bills every single session to improve and strengthen election integrity.
This year we will continue that trend with another bill from our good Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson.
Utah has been and will continue to be a model of election integrity.
Unfortunately, some in our country have found that unsubstantiated claims and flat-out lies are an effective way to destabilize our constitutional republic and make it harder for their opponents to participate and vote.
Voting security must never be about making it harder for legal voters to vote.
Please beware of false choices.
As a conservative, I believe that we should always work to make constitutional rights more accessible, not less.
I am very proud that voter participation has increased since I became Lt. Governor and now Governor.
We can have safe and secure elections without making it harder to exercise our constitutional right to vote.
As I have traveled the state, I’ve heard some argue that the Constitution will someday, if not now, hang by a thread and need rescuing.
I worry that what a few of them fail to see is that, they — just like those for whom they have so much disdain and contempt — are daily hacking away at those cords, recklessly believing that they will know exactly when to stop slicing and start saving.
Tonight, I’m asking every one of us to do our part to start tying those “mystic c[h]ords of memory” back together again.
Now, to members of the Legislature, I want to thank you personally and sincerely for the sacrifices you make to leave families and employment for these 45 days to do the people’s work.
I want you to know that I respect you and I admire you.
There are many other bills we are supporting together that I could have mentioned this evening, but due to time constraints I can’t share them all.
You will notice I have not mentioned any bills sponsored by my brother-in-law Sen. Mike McKell.
You may recall that last year I vetoed one of his bills, something I hope we can make an annual tradition.
For about 85% of you, this might be it.
As a citizen legislature, you are only guaranteed these final 45 days of legislative service.
I would ask you how you want to spend these precious few days together.
We have so much work to do.
Real work.
Hard work.
I sometimes worry that we waste too much valuable time on things that tear us apart and ultimately don’t matter.
You may have noticed last year that I have very little interest in fighting the so-called culture wars.
Every good and worthy cause — taken to an extreme (and if there’s one thing we are good at today, it’s taking everything to extremes) — can become toxic and destructive.
It used to be said that all politics is local.
I no longer believe that to be true.
Today all politics is national.
And that is bad.
Very bad.
The easiest thing in the world is to watch MSNBC or Fox News and simply adopt all of their talking points and policies.
It’s certainly more entertaining than this speech.
It’s the most tried and true way to get likes on social media.
It is also terribly destructive.
And it certainly isn’t leadership.
But that’s not us.
That’s not Utah.
At least it’s not Utah at its best.
The good people of our state — and our country — are in desperate search for leadership.
A desperate search for hope.
In past generations as Americans, we dreamed big.
Now, I’m afraid that our eyes are consistently in the gutter.
But not in Utah.
Not yet anyway.
In Utah, we still look up.
I firmly believe in my heart that if America is the last great hope of the world, then Utah is the last great hope of America.
But this is no guaranteed birthright.
We have a choice, and we must make it every day.
We can either become like every other state in the union or we can continue to be that quirky state out West that still believes in working together.
Cynics like to attack this concept of “the Utah Way.
They say it’s a useless slogan: overplayed, untrue, or trite.
"Some lose interest in the concept as soon as something happens that they disagree with, forgetting that, as Judge Learned Hand taught us, ""the spirit of liberty is the spirit that is not too sure it is right."
We may not always get it right, but in Utah we reject false choices.
Here in Utah, we proudly protect religious liberties and love and proudly protect our LGBTQ neighbors.
We deeply love our refugees and immigrants from all parts of the world and deeply respect the rule of law.
In Utah, we wisely invest in the future, and wisely don't spend beyond our means, even saving for rainy days.
We share a love of community while holding individual freedoms as sacred.
We protect our unborn and support our single mothers and children facing poverty and trauma.
And we fully stand behind our beloved people of color and our beloved people in law enforcement.
So, let’s not be distracted for a second by cynics who fail to appreciate the Utah Way.
Let’s cheerfully and resolutely go about doing the people’s work, the real work and the hard work of governance.
Competently, and often quietly, lifting Utahns up and improving lives.
As a point of personal privilege, Mr. President and Mr. Speaker, I will conclude with a brief family story of mine (and yours, Mr. Speaker).
My ancestor Orville Sutherland Cox moved to this state from Illinois where his home was burned to the ground by angry mobs.
They lost everything.
Well, almost everything.
When two men showed up with torches to burn the house, my pregnant grandmother refused to leave until those men helped remove her favorite piece of furniture.
After ignoring their threats and realizing she was serious, the two men put down their torches, carried the cabinet from the home and then burned the rest of the house to the ground.
When my grandfather returned, they cooked dinner on the ashes of the home and soon made their way to the barren desert of Utah.
You see, my great-great-great grandfather had every reason to hate the United States of America, a country that promised him his First Amendment right to a free exercise of religion only to see that same government stand aside when the mobs assembled.
To my friends of color: You may believe the immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr. that, “the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice .
” but you also know it sure takes a long time Upon his arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, Orville was immediately sent up the canyon to help bring back timber to help solve Utah’s first housing crisis.
Losing sight of his mission to bring back lumber to build new homes, Orville instead brought back a “magnificent specimen of a pine” for a Liberty Pole that was raised on Pioneer Square just a few blocks from where we sit tonight.
This was the first pole to carry the American flag in the Salt Lake Valley.
But he never gave up on the IDEA of America.
He believed in the promise of what America could be — not what it was at that moment.
to get there.
Let’s walk together and do the work to make Utah a place where there is truly liberty and justice for all.
Please don’t give up on the idea of America.
To my friends in rural Utah, who for far too long have exported our kids away from home: I understand that you’re hurting.
We have seen far too many deaths of despair.
Let’s walk together and do the work to make Utah a place where the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is found in every community.
Please don’t give up on the idea of America.
And to my Democratic friends, who worry that our country is broken beyond repair because we are failing to take care of each other: I agree with Bill Clinton, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.
Please don’t give up on the idea of America.
To my Republican friends, who feel like the world is moving too quickly and the other side is trying to change our very way of life: I agree with George W. Bush who said, “Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions.
Please don’t give up on the idea of America.
To you my fellow public servants, I pledge my hands and my heart in this work.
It is our privilege to represent the great citizens of this state for but a moment in time.
Let’s do the big things.
Let’s do the things that matter.
Real work.
Hard work.
May God bless you.
And may God forever bless the great state of Utah.
