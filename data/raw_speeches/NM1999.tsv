Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of the Forty-Fourth Legislature, distinguished guests, my fellow New Mexicans: Our state constitution has set aside this time each year for your public servants to come together, assess the condition of our state and present their findings to the citizens to whom they are accountable.
In a moment I'm going to talk about things we, as a state, have accomplished over the last four years, things we will be finishing this year and new initiatives we need to undertake to keep pace with the times.
But, before I do, I want to reflect for a moment on what I believe the people of New Mexico want from those of us who serve in Santa Fe.
As I traveled the state last year, talking with the people, there were three things that became clear to me.
First, there is strong agreement that the road to New Mexico's future is the road we're on.
The people want increased accountability, lower taxes and greater wisdom regarding the bills we pass.
In the town of Locris in ancient Greece, a man who proposed a law in the popular assembly did so on a platform with a rope around his neck.
If the law passed, they removed the rope; and, if it failed, they removed the platform.
I'll bet it made those folks think twice before proposing new laws for the land.
Second, New Mexicans want to see free expression of ideas -- even disagreement -- but they want it done in a spirit of cooperation by the executive, legislative and judicial arms of government.
And, third, they want all of us – democrats and republicans -- to put aside our egos and our pettiness so that we can work together to do what's truly best for the people of this great state.
With these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss some of the things I believe are accomplishments for the people of New Mexico.
Many important things have been achieved to make New Mexico a better place to live.
Taxes were lowered by 100 million dollars.
We're now out from under 13 of the 14 provisions of the Duran consent decree.
That means the federal government will be stepping away from our prisons.
And, Medicaid's been saved.
The new managed care program is working and offers more and better services to New Mexicans who need medical care assistance.
Other programs that were initiated need to be finished.
We need to complete the massive 500-miles of new highway projects.
When completed, many more New Mexican communities will be able to grow and expand.
Our new welfare program is on target, but it does need some minor adjustments to make it work as well as it should.
This also needs to be addressed.
The Hobbs prison is 100% on line.
The Santa Rosa prison will be accepting prisoners this month.
We now have a place to put criminals behind bars instead of releasing them because there's no place to house them.
We have an acting Chief Information Officer, but this is not a cabinet position.
Nor is such a position required by law in our state.
With the rapid expansion of computers and other communication technologies -- we need to make this a required position with cabinet accountability.
As to new things that need to be done, we must look at each one very carefully.
"We need to continue to prioritize our ""want"" list so that we do not increase the budget."
We must be willing to bypass some possibly good ideas to keep New Mexico fiscally sound.
We must be mature enough to realize we can't always have everything we want -- so we must prioritize and make sure we take care of the most important things.
"Some wit once said ""always put off until tomorrow that which shouldn't be done at all."
I think there's some wisdom hidden in that remark.
Now, here are some things I believe we should concentrate on during 1999.
"In the case of crime: Not only do we need to eliminate our current ""good time"" policy and make sure most violent criminals stay behind bars for at least 85% of their sentence, but we need to streamline death penalty appeals so that justice can be served swiftly and surely."
Punishment is a deterrent to crime if the punishment is swift and sure.
We need to crackdown on uninsured motorists.
At least three things should happen here: One, limit uninsured motorists’ ability to collect damages; Two, change the law so insurance companies can offer policy limits which will lower the cost of auto insurance.
California has minimum policy limits of 15-thousand dollars - New Mexico has 25-thousand dollar limits.
California’s average insurance cost has been dropping since reforms were enacted in 1997.
Three, fund a motor vehicle division whose sole function is to enforce the law.
And – we need to get even tougher with individuals who are unwilling to drink responsibly but are willing to risk their life and the lives of others by driving under the influence.
On a different note, New Mexico is one of the most beautiful states in the nation.
I’d like all of us to become more aware of the first visual impression people receive when they come to our state, whether they are looking for a place to set up new businesses or searching for a vacation spot.
Appearance matters.
Litter-free roads and highways matter.
We will step up our efforts to prevent and clean up the litter throughout the Land of Enchantment.
My plan calls for the use of state-of-the-art machinery, a cutting-edge public awareness campaign, an increased inmate labor force and enforcement of penalties for those who litter.
We will keep New Mexico beautiful.
Cleaning up New Mexico will continue to be a personal priority and a priority of this administration.
The last two things I want to talk about before addressing education initiatives are both high priorities for this administration.
First, I want to strive to achieve a 100-million dollar personal income tax reduction over the next three years.
Second, I have talked about how important it is to set priorities for new programs -- I want to suggest it is just as important to set priorities for eliminating rules and regs, boards and commissions, programs and agencies.
"To that end, I am proposing a ""Sunset Commission"" review every rule and regulation, every board and commission, and every program and agency for consideration for elimination."
Every year we pass more and more things into law.
But -- it is rare that we clean up the books and subtract anything.
"Thomas Jefferson once said, ""As government grows, freedom recedes."
The truth of these words is self-evident.
Therefore, in the name of greater freedom for New Mexicans, it is incumbent upon us to eliminate laws and programs that are no longer needed.
Education continues to be my top priority.
So, at this time, I'd like to address some of our educational needs.
"In H. G. Wells’ Outline of History, he said, ""Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe."
I believe this quote is one of the clearest statements ever made about the importance of education.
I was very pleased a month ago when Senator Aragon announced that education was going to be a top priority of his as well.
I believe the legislature and I can work together to really start moving New Mexico up from the low rankings it now has.
Our young people deserve more.
They deserve the best we can give them.
Here are eight education initiatives I'd like to see us work on together.
First – Let's really consider a school voucher program.
By bringing competition for the educational dollar into the marketplace I believe education will begin to rapidly improve.
It certainly works with higher education.
Why not have New Mexico attract educational entrepreneurs from all over the country ready to prove that there is a better way.
We would lead the country in educational improvement with the simple passage of a voucher bill.
A good example of how well competition works is the U. S. Postal Service.
When the Postal Service had to contend with FedEx and United Parcel Service, they suddenly got competitive.
The U. S. Postal Service is now faster and more efficient than it ever was.
In fact, it often outperforms it's competitors.
Second- With respect to public school capital outlay, we need to repeal Little Davis Bacon.
This law makes almost every kind of physical improvement to schools cost about 15% more than it would without the law.
It's just not sensible to throw education dollars away because of a law that none of our surrounding states have to contend with.
All of our surrounding states are building six schools instead of five.
Third - I'd like to see us establish more charter schools.
Such schools have great latitude in designing programs that best suit the students attending their school.
Fourth - We need to insure a minimum level of teaching competence that's acceptable for our schools.
We also should consider various kinds of alternative certification.
There are many people with solid, professional experience who could make great contributions to our schools but do not have degrees in education.
For example, a retired Ph.
D. in physics from Los Alamos could not teach a basic science course in our middle schools and a Certified Public Accountant couldn’t teach a business class in our high schools.
Nor could a Medical Doctor specializing in Internal Medicine teach a 9th grade health course.
Wouldn’t it be great to have one of them as a teacher?
Fifth - We should test every child, every year so we can better evaluate which programs and styles of teaching are most effective.
It would also allow us to quickly see which young people need more or a different kind of help.
Sixth - We should take it upon ourselves to make sure that all children are able to read by the third grade.
First, second and third grade testing is a critical component of this goal.
Simply put, if you are not reading by the end of the third grade, you don’t go to the fourth grade.
Seventh - Along the same lines, we should bring additional accountability to the schools themselves by improving our methods of evaluating and ranking our schools.
And -- eighth – Prior to 1958, public education in New Mexico was a responsibility of the Governor.
The Governor appointed the members of the State School Board, and the Governor was also an ex-officio member of the Board.
As such, the Governor was accountable to the people of New Mexico for public education.
Today, the State Board is autonomous and has state level responsibility for all public education.
It's true that board members are elected by the people.
But, it's also true that it is quite difficult for the voters to really know much about those who run the state school board.
Therefore, I believe it is critical to our overall program of improving education in New Mexico, to establish a cabinet position for the Secretary of Education.
In addition, I would like to abolish the State School Board or make it so that the Governor appoints the State School Board members.
I thank you for your patience in listening to my words.
I ask for all men and women of good will to work with the legislature and my administration to make this an even greater state.
In closing, I can find no better statement of what constitutes good government than the words of Ezra Taft Benson.
"He said, ""Since God created man with certain inalienable rights, and man, in turn, created government to help secure those rights, it follows that man is superior to government and should remain master over it, not the other way around."
That is my dream for New Mexico.
May God bless our state and all of us who live here and work together to ensure a rich quality of life for ourselves and our children.
