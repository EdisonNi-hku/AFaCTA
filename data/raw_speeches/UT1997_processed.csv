SENTENCES
"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Lieutenant Governor, my fellow citizens: As we gather together on Human Rights Day, at the dawn of Utah's second century, we are participating in one of the fundamental transformations in human history, the transition from the Industrial Age to the Information Age, the dawning of a new epoch with all of its associated uncertainties and opportunities."
"Will Utah be ready for the new century?Yes, we will."
"We will plan wisely for growth, for the global economy, and for the Information Age."
We will be ready to welcome the world in 2002.
"Utah has always met its challenges straight-up, head-on."
We were recently recognized as the nation's best-managed state.
"Our economy is strong, our stature in the world is growing, and we continue to enjoy an incomparable quality of life."
"Unemployment is at a forty-year low, and our spendable incomes are on the rise."
Our students are among the nation's best and brightest.
Utah is a young and vigorous state.
We're poised for the 21st Century.
"We're more than ready, we're already on our way."
TRANSPORTATION This year we break ground for a 21st Century transportation system.
"Many of our roads and highways are outdated, worn out, and in some cases, unsafe."
"If you've ever crept along I15 at ten miles an hour during what is ironically termed ""rush hour,"" you know for yourself: it's time to act."
"If you've ever waited 10 minutes at the 12th South interchange in Provo, or felt you would grow old waiting for a break in traffic on St. George Boulevard, on Harrison Boulevard in Ogden, or on Logan's Main Street, you know it's time to build a transportation system for the future."
"In our last legislative session, we established the Centennial Highway Fund, a ten-year 3.6-billion-dollar investment in a transportation system to meet pressing needs in nearly every county and city in the State of Utah."
"We need new interchanges in Weber, Washington and Utah Counties; new highways in Davis and Cache Counties; major improvements in Iron, Uintah, San Juan and Box Elder Counties and every other county in the state."
"The first and largest project is the reconstruction of I15, which begins this Spring."
Our state is like a family embarking on a home remodeling project.
"You know what it's like: you end up cooking in the basement and storing the refrigerator in the front hall, but you put up with all the noise and inconvenience and the sheet rock dust that drifts into your cornflakes, because you know it's worth it."
"At times, it will be inconvenient and messy for the commuters on I15, too, but the Department of Transportation will do its best to help us cope."
They will tell us about the best alternative routes and alert us about any delays we might encounter during the reconstruction project.
"Like any family beginning a home remodeling project, the State needs to plan its finances carefully."
"I have followed two very simple funding philosophies: one, our funding plan must be affordable, and two, it must be fair."
"By affordable, I mean that our funding plan must fit into people's budgets."
"We knew, when we embarked on this project, it would have to be something taxpayers could afford."
So we have cut taxes every year for the last three years.
"We have cut property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes."
"For every new dollar in road taxes, we have lowered other taxes by three dollars.Let me repeat that."
"For every dollar in proposed new road taxes, we have cut general taxes by three dollars.This is a fair funding plan."
"It means everybody pays a little, but those who use the roads the most, pay the most."
"For example, under my proposal, large trucks pay more because they cause more wear and tear on roads.That's only fair."
My plan also includes fuel taxes and car registration fees.
"But even with the changes, Utah's gas tax will be no higher than those in surrounding states, and our automobile registration fee will still be one of the nation's lowest."
I like it because if you don't use it you don't pay.
And what about those who will use the roads after the reconstruction project is completed?
"Shouldn't they pay part of the cost, too?I think so."
"That's why I'm proposing that through bonding, 10% of the costs be paid by tomorrow's drivers."
"May I say to you as legislators, this is a demanding legislative task, one that requires our best statesmanship."
Let us not be Republicans or Democrats on this issue.Let us be Utahns.
"Let us not be citizens of urban cities or rural towns, let us be Utahns."
"On this historic occasion, let us rise above narrow self-interests and unite in the State's common interest.We must not fail."
The risk of refusal is too high; the price of procrastination too great.Will it be easy?No.Will it be pleasant?No.Will it be worth it?Absolutely.
"We can do it, and we can do it well."
"Together, we can build the roads that will take us and our children into the next century."
WORKFORCE SERVICES Preparing for the 21st Century will take more than just concrete and reinforced steel.
"It will take every ounce of imagination, heart and good will that we possess."
And that's why I ask you tonight to move forward on Utah's innovative Workforce Services Department.
This is a fundamental change in philosophy.
"We're escaping from a big-government, Washington-knows-best, top-down, one-size-fits-all, steady-stream-of-welfare, no-hope, no-exit fiasco."
"In its place, we're offering a dignified path to self-sufficiency for those who need help."
"I like to call this the ""wise neighbor"" philosophy."
"We've all known a ""wise neighbor""--the person down the street who is always willing to help out, but who trusts us to make our own smart choices."
"I remember my own wise neighbors, country doctor Paul Edmunds and his wife, Ella."
Mrs. Edmunds was the sort of person who welcomed each new neighbor with a loaf of freshly-baked bread.
"As a young boy growing up in Cedar City, my Levis were always torn at the knees, something which did not make me as fashionable then as it might today."
"When my mother mentioned this problem to Mrs. Edmunds, she didn't offer to do my mother's mending."
She simply taught my mother a mending technique durable enough to stand up to an active seven-year-old.
Mrs. Edmunds knew instinctively what some Washington bureaucrats never understood.
"For too long, welfare has stripped people of their independence."
"People would run into problems, and instead of teaching them how to mend their own broken lives, government just threw money at the problems."
"Utah's ""wise neighbor"" welfare reforms are working."
Take Jessica--a single mom on welfare who found a job and earned a raise.
"Under federal regulations, her raise disqualified her for child care assistance."
Jessica agonized for two weeks about what to do.
"She loved her job and she hated welfare, but she couldn't afford to work and pay child care."
"So Jessica quit her job, and went back on welfare, but she didn't think it made sense.She was right."
"Under Utah's welfare reform, caseworkers meet with clients like Jessica to put together an individual self-sufficiency plan, a flexible, practical plan to help each client get training, get a job, keep a job, and become self-sufficient."
"Today, Jessica is working at a new job and she has once again earned a raise."
But things are different this time.She kept her job.
"We used common sense, and helped with her child care."
It costs the state far less to give her a little help with child care during her transition to self sufficiency than to send her back on welfare.
"The old system didn't make sense, and Utah was one of the first states in the nation to begin reforming welfare four years ago."
"We were so successful that we expanded welfare reform statewide in July, and we are consolidating programs from six different departments into one streamlined Department of Workforce Services."
It will bring all state employment services into one department.
"Now, like wise neighbors, we can help people enjoy that sense of autonomy and self-worth that comes from taking charge of our own lives."
Jessica's story is just one of thousands.
"The number of Utah families on welfare has dropped by more than 5,000 as reform has been implemented."
"Think of it: more than 5,000 families whose members have mended their lives, have regained their self-esteem, and are now contributing their skills and talents to Utah's future."
"HEALTH CARE REFORM Four years ago, we agreed that health insurance should be accessible for every Utahn, and each year since then, we have taken carefully-planned steps to achieve that goal."
"Today, tens of thousands of Utah's citizens have gained access to affordable health care."
This year we take another step.
"Like wise neighbors, the State and its partners in the private insurance industry have made it possible for individuals who were previously uninsurable to purchase health care."
"Most of these people will purchase private health coverage, and those few who cannot, will be able to purchase coverage through a special state program."
Our health care goals are in sight; let us take another step toward making health care accessible for all Utahns.
"HIGHER EDUCATION Like health care, higher education is essential not only for our individual well-being but for the well-being of the entire community."
"I am often struck, in fact, by the similarities in the challenges we face in the fields of health care and higher education."
Both are being reshaped by enormous changes in technology and market pressures.
"College administrators, like hospitals and doctors, find themselves confronted by consumers clamoring for better access and lower costs, with no reduction in quality."
"Utah's colleges, universities and applied technology centers offer our citizens the intellectual nourishment and lifelong training that are essential in our changing world."
"But like institutions all over the world, they are moving at bullet-train speed into a new age of competition and market-driven change."
"We must commit to stand by our colleges, universities and applied technology centers, and nurture them during this difficult transition period."
"Our task is not to shield them from change, but to be a partner in their transformation."
"Fortunately, the very technologies that are driving these changes are also providing some of the solutions."
"Utah has joined with thirteen other states to create the Western Governors' University, a technology-based university that will offer degree and certificate programs from state-supported and private institutions throughout the West."
Tonight I am pleased to announce that its headquarters will be in Salt Lake City.
PUBLIC EDUCATION Our investment in world-class public education is paying big dividends.
"The last four years have brought higher academic standards, smaller classes, and better teacher pay."
"Parents have more influence in schools, and we have established thousands of new partnerships between business and education."
Our students are using the technologies of tomorrow in their classrooms today.
"Through the Internet, our students have at their fingertips an electronic library stocked with thousands of publications, more current and more complete than any newsstand."
"Though Ednet, our educational video network, students have access to hundreds of classes all over the state."
"Technology is changing our classrooms in fundamental ways, but no computer can ever replace a caring teacher."
"Tonight, I pay tribute to Utah's hard-working and dedicated teachers, particularly to one of our outstanding teachers and associates, Representative Kurt Oscarson."
Our hearts go out to his family as they deal with the loss of a father and husband.
"He will be missed here in the halls of the Utah State Legislature, and by hundreds of students who had the privilege of learning from him.Utah has lost a good man."
CRIME When you think about our preparation for the next century nothing ranks higher than keeping our schools and communities safe.
"When you drop your child off at school, you have the right to expect that school to be drug-free and gun-free."
We must do everything in our power to keep our kids safe at school.
"In the past four years, we've more than doubled our juvenile corrections capacity, and we've hired new juvenile judges and probation officers to handle the increased case load."
We've made sure that kids who commit adult crime are serving adult time.
"This year, we're calling for tough new sentencing guidelines that will intervene earlier and dole out more severe penalties for repeat offenders."
"It does no good, however, to pass tough laws unless we have the jails, prisons and juvenile facilities to back them up."
"In this year's budget, I propose that we add more than 1,200 slots for juvenile and adult offenders."
Correction facilities are expensive but essential.
Utahns everywhere say crime is one of their major concerns.
Let's do what's necessary to keep our communities safe.
"NATIONAL POLITICS Last November, this country elected a president."
But both major parties selected their candidates without any meaningful participation from the citizens of Utah or other Rocky Mountain states.
Our selection process was too late.
That's why Western leaders from both major parties want to hold a Rocky Mountain Presidential Primary election beginning in the year 2000.
An early Rocky Mountain primary would become a major event in the presidential campaign.
"Candidates would come, they would get to know us, and we would get to know them."
Our issues would receive national attention.
I ask that we join with our neighboring states to give Utah and the West a voice in selecting the leader of the free world.
Utah's voice deserves to be heard.
"While on the subject of national politics, I wish to extend on behalf of all Utahns our best wishes to the president, who was inaugurated today."
We express our deepest desire that the president and Congress set aside partisan interests and get on with the business of the people.
A critical item of business is balancing the national budget.
I am hopeful that this body will have the opportunity to ratify a constitutional amendment imposing on Congress the same discipline that we and nearly every other state have: to balance our budgets.
"To the Congress, I say: It's time.Let's get it done!"
WILDERNESS Another issue unique to the West: wilderness.
"For decades, this issue has divided our people."
"Both sides of the wilderness debate see Utah's canyons, deserts and mountains as sacred, but for different reasons."
"Let us learn from a bigger debate that the world has watched for centuries; a debate about land, about peace, and about trust."
"On a luminous September day in 1993, I stood on the south lawn of the White House to witness the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and the PLO."
"Former presidents, secretaries of state, and world leaders waited for the ceremony to begin as helicopters hovered overhead securing the air space, and thousands of journalists positioned themselves at the crowd's edge."
"Across the street in Lafayette Park, protesters from both sides loudly chanted their objections."
"Finally, Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin walked with President Clinton from the White House."
"They stood side by side on a simple platform, two leaders of nations who had for centuries fought each other over land that both held sacred for different reasons."
I will never forget what Prime Minister Rabin said that day.
"""We are destined to live together on the same soil in the same land."
We the soldiers who have returned from battles .. .
Enough. . . . We are today giving peace a chance.
"As the ceremony drew to a close, Arafat extended his hand, and the world waited to see how Rabin would respond."
"Slowly, hesitantly, they reached toward each other."
"Their eyes met, their hands touched, and a huge sigh went up from the crowd."
"Interestingly, the actual content of the peace accords was not dramatic; the parties had reached an agreement on relatively small points."
"But those small points of agreement were highly symbolic, establishing a path of trust toward broader future agreement."
"Succeeding years have shown, of course, that the peace process has been neither swift nor sure, and Rabin even gave his life for peace."
"But who does not count it as a major victory for both sides, that after two thousand years of fighting over a land they each held sacred, these old enemies took the first steps toward peace?"
"We're not talking about world peace, but our state, for decades, has been divided on the wilderness issue."
"It is time, now, to say enough fighting, to begin building on what unites us."
"Each of us shares a love for the land, and each of us shares a common desire to preserve sensitive lands."
Let us begin with those lands on which there is substantial agreement.
"I'd like to say to the extremes on both sides of this debate, let's quit protesting in Lafayette Park, come to the table, and after 20 years let's stop fighting and start protecting land."
"Tonight, I challenge all sides of this debate to take one small, but symbolically important step toward our own peaceful resolution."
"In the next few weeks, I will invite all wilderness stakeholders to my office to discuss a proposal to begin the process."
We must recognize that gradual progress is superior to perpetually-deferred perfection.
Will we ultimately agree on everything?Perhaps not.
But time and trust will take us a long way.
"Let us begin, each of us, by offering a hand in trust.We only fail if we quit.Let us give trust a chance."
"CONCLUSION You know, willing and wise neighbors pull together to overcome challenges and fulfill big dreams.That is our tradition in Utah."
"For the sake of our children and their children, we will work together to transform education and reform welfare, to combat crime, to provide health care access."
"And, yes, we will build highways for the 21st Century: electronic highways of bits and bytes, and wide, smooth highways of concrete and steel."
It will stretch us; it will measure our mettle and test our character.
But I say bring on the 21st Century.Utah is ready!
