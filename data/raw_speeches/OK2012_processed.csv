SENTENCES
"Lieutenant Governor Lamb, statewide elected officials, Speaker Steele, President Pro Tem Bingman, members of the court, Honorable Senators and Representatives, cabinet members, distinguished guests, and citizens of Oklahoma:It is my duty as well as my great honor to be here today to discuss the state of our state as we begin the 2012 legislative session."
"I’m joined today by my family, my husband Wade and our wonderful children."
Thank you for your love and support.
"And to the people of Oklahoma, thank you for giving me the incredible opportunity to serve as your governor."
"It has been an honor, a privilege and an incredible experience for my staff, my family and for me personally to work every day for the people of this state, and to help build a stronger and more prosperous Oklahoma."
"It has also been an honor to serve as the Commander in Chief of our National Guard during a time when so many of our Guardsmen have been deployed overseas, fighting for freedom and for the safety of the American people."
"I’d like to take a moment right now to recognize the many Oklahomans in our armed services, both past and present."
Will the active duty military and veterans with us today please stand.
"We honor their service and sacrifice, especially the 77 Oklahomans who gave their lives during Operation Iraqi Freedom and the 83 Oklahomans who have lost their lives in the war in Afghanistan."
"To the families of thosemen and womenwhohave paid the ultimate price, we offer our greatest gratitude, deepestsympathies and most heartfeltprayers."
"Soon,3,000 guardsmen and women will be returning to Oklahoma from Afghanistan and Kuwait."
Nothing could make us more thrilled than to welcome themhome.
"Adjutant General Myles Deering, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Rita Aragon and I are ready to help our returning soldiers with a smooth transition back to Oklahoma."
"We have committed resources to help them find jobs, receive counseling, and address other needs."
"I’m asking everyone here today to please join me in a brief, silent prayer for the safety and wellbeing of our troops.Thank you."
Our goal as lawmakers should be to build a better and more prosperous state forour returning troops and for all Oklahomans.
"I’m happy to say that in the last year, we have done well on that front."
The progress we have made in Oklahoma comes despite facing a number of difficult circumstances.
"A year ago today we were just starting to climb out of a recession that cost Oklahoma nearly 80,000 jobs."
"Like people all around the country, many Oklahomans were struggling."
Jobs had disappeared in the wake of a financial crisis that was largely out of our control.Tax revenues were down.
And the state was facing a budgetshortfall of over $500 million with only $2 left in our “Rainy Day” account.
It was with that difficult backdrop that I asked you –our legislators –to work with me to do threethings.
"The firstwas to pass measures that would create jobs and jump-start our economy by building thebest, most competitive economicclimate possible."
"The second was to reduce government waste, and to make state government smaller, smarter and more efficient."
"Finally, I asked the legislature to work with me to strengthen education and pass measures to boost student performance."
"I am proud to say that we worked together and rose to the challenge, making2011 one of the most productive legislative sessions in memory."
"To reduce job-killing legal fees, we passed sweeping lawsuit reform that included a $350,000 hard cap for non-economic damages."
"We delivered the largest rewrite in state history of our workers’compensation system, improving it while being fair to both injured workers and employers."
"That action has already helped to bolster the state’s business climate by lowering costsfor Oklahoma businesses by $30million, a number that will rise as these reforms continue to be implemented this year."
While many other states were raising taxes in order to close their budget gaps –and driving out jobs in the process –wecut our income tax.
"Because of that, Oklahomans will be able to keep an extra $116million of their hard-earned moneythis year, providing relief to working families and spurring economic growth in the private sector."
These and other reforms have helped to create a business climate in Oklahoma that has lead to greater prosperity and job growth.And the numbers back that up.
"In2011, the state of Oklahoma had a net increase of 41,600 jobs."
Our job growth rateranks 3rd among all states.
We’ve gained back over two-thirds of the jobs lost in Oklahoma to the most devastating economic collapse since the Great Depression.
Ourunemployment rate continues to be one of the lowest in the country at 6.1 percent.
"Despite the worst drought on record, Oklahoma agricultural exports are up almost 70 percentin the last three quarters thanks to the tenacity of our farmers and ranchers."
"Oklahoma ranked first in the nation for the growth of manufacturing jobs, which grew two and a halftimes faster than they did in Texas and five times faster than the national average."
These gains are also reflected in our population.
"Whereas once our citizens left Oklahoma to escape the Dust Bowl, we’re now ranked eighthin the number of new residents we have attracted."
"In fact, the largest number now comes from California, a complete reversal of the migratory patterns depicted in Depression-era works like TheGrapes of Wrath."
All of these indicators demonstrate that Oklahoma’seconomy continues to outperform the national economy.
"People all across the country are noticing: Oklahoma stands as a testament to the fact that low taxes, limited government, and fiscal discipline are a recipe for job creation."
"Our success stands in stark contrast to the record of dysfunction, failed policies, and outrageous spending that occurs in Washington, D. C. In Oklahoma, we could teach Washington a lesson or twoabout fiscal policy and the size and proper role of government."
"That’s why I’m asking that we send our president and his allies a message this year, in the form of a resolution declaring that Oklahoma will support a Federal Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution."
Washington is leading this country off a fiscal cliff.
It is reckless; it is wrong; and it is destroying jobs and holding back economic growth in all 50 states.
"Most importantly, it threatens the success of our children’s future."
Oklahoma needs to be on the record saying so.
"Despite the missteps in Washington, 2011 proved to be a better yearhere in Oklahoma."
"After a long and painful recession, our citizensarefinding good jobs and getting back to work."
"I realize, however,there are many Oklahomans who are still looking for jobs, as well as businesses looking for skilled labor."
That’s whythe Department of Commerceand I are pleased to announce the launch of a major online initiative called OKJobMatch.
com to match students and job seekers with employers.
Some of the most unique skill sets are possessed by our military veterans and those returning with the Armed Services from overseas.
Thesemen and women deserve our help to find jobs and reenter the workforce.OKJobMatch.
com will serve as a comprehensive reemployment resource for returning military men and women who have bravely served us.
"I would like to encourage both employers and thoseof any backgroundwho are looking for employment tohelp uspopulate the sitewith resumes and job opportunitiesand aid us in making this a valuable tool for job growth. . As we look to continue Oklahoma’s impressive rate of job creationin the private sector, we must continueour efforts to eliminate waste in the public sectorand create a smaller, more efficient and more customer friendly state government."
"As you know,last year we signed into law a seriesof government modernization measures designed to eliminate waste and save taxpayer dollars, including one that consolidated several government agencies under the Office of State Finance and instructed OSF to reduce expenditures by 15 percent."
I’m happy to report that target has been exceeded.
"I want to commend Secretary of Finance Preston Doerflingerand his teamfor realizingover $4.2 million in savingsin 2012while delivering a more streamlined, customer friendlyapproach to government."
"Additionally, the Information Technology modernization and consolidation measures passed by the legislatureare projected to save $170million over seven years."
My thanks go out toour state CIO Alex Pettit and state agencies for the work they havedone toupdate and centralizeIT services.
"For example, in the Department of Education,under Superintendent Janet Baressi, IT reforms saved$600,000 in 2011 and are expected to deliver another $3 million in the following three years."
"Phone lines, email systems and the department Website have all been upgraded, leading to a more responsive, transparent and again–customer friendly –Department of Education."
"Now, because of the successes of our IT initiatives, I have askedHigherEducation–and they have agreed –to explore IT consolidation opportunities of their own, starting with thecreation of their own chief information officer."
"As these examples show, we will always be able toeliminate waste,find more savings, more efficiencyand more opportunities to modernize government."
It is important to continuously improve and rethinkhow government works to solve problems.
"Our criminal justice and corrections systems, for example, illustrate that point well."
"In 2011, I appreciated thatthe Legislatureand, in particular, Speaker Steele,joined me in supporting“smart on crime” initiatives."
"Together, we acted to increase resources for substance-abuse treatment centers that are less expensive and more effectivealternatives toprison for non-violent offenders with addiction problems."
"This year, we can do even more."
"My budget reflects a financial commitmentto alternative sentencing for non-violent offenders with substance abuse issues, as well to the “crisis centers” provided by the Department of Mental Health, which offer help and hope to Oklahomans strugglingfrom addiction or other mental health issues."
"These initiatives are smart, effective at reducing repeat offenses, and will save the state money by treating addicts and helping them to once again become productive citizens, parents and taxpayers."
Our goalas lawmakers and public servants–regardless of what agency we are dealing with –is to achievebetter results and better services.
One of the areas we identified as in need of improvement last year was education.
"That’s why we pursued importantmeasureslast sessiondesigned to improve our schools,boost test scores and ultimately deliver a stronger and better educated work force."
"I want to thank the Legislature for sending me a series of outstanding education reform bills, including A-through-Fgrading for public schoolsand the end of social promotion."
"The Department of Education is implementing these reforms and performance measurements through initiativesdesigned to promote, as Superintendant Barresi says,“College, Career,and Citizen Readiness."
"Those three “Cs” are exactly what we should be promoting in Oklahoma, which is whyI partnered with Higher Education officials to launchOklahoma’s Complete College America Initiative."
Oklahoma must do a better job of encouraging Oklahomans to pursue higher levels of education and to complete more degree or certificate programs.
We know that amajority of the jobs created in the next decade will require either a college education or a career certificate from one ofour Career Technology centers.
"Additionally, college graduates earn $1 million more over their lifetime than high school graduates."
"That’s why we have set a goal to increase the number of college graduates from 30,500 degrees and certificates awarded annually to 50,900."
"As you can tell, I’m proud of the work we have accomplished in such a short period of time.But thatwork is not done .far from it."
"The people of Oklahoma expect us to continue to focus on moving this state forward and creating a more prosperous, better state to live and work in."
They expect their lawmakers to continue to find and eliminate waste in government and to make our state agencies run as efficiently and effectively as possible.
"That’s why in 2012 I am asking the Legislaturetojoin mein focusing on initiatives that will createmorejobs, encourage more efficiency in government, improve our infrastructure and continue to bolster the quality of our workforce."
Our first task is to craft a budget that reflects these priorities.
I am happy and proud to say that our budget numbers for the next fiscal year look considerably better than we thought they would a year ago.
Revenues are up nearly 10percentover initial estimates.That’s good news.
But the state is also experiencing a significant loss ofone-time sources of funding.
"In fact, the state has been left to find over $500 million in revenue to replace those lost funding sources."
Thatmeansthat most of our agencies will be facing a flat budget moving into Fiscal Year 2013.
"But it does not mean that we will accept the status quo, or that “funding as usual” means “business as usual."
"As a manager in the private sector, I used to tell my employees “to inspect what they expect."
"As governor, I expect efficiency and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars."
"So this year,we are initiating a statewide performance evaluation initiative among every state agency."
"Under current law, state agencies are required to submit a strategic plan that includes goals and proposals for increased efficiency and improved services."
"Unfortunately, these plans have not, historically, been carefully scrutinized."
"Well, it’s a new day in Oklahoma."
Myoffice and the Office of State Finance willbegin evaluatingeach and every one of these plans and will usenew software and technologies thatmeasure performance and efficiency and align expenditures with outcomes.
That analysis will help usto right-size government and ensure that each agency is operating as effectivelyas possible.
Improving state services isn’t a bullet point in a stump speech.It’s a necessity.
"At the Department of Human Services, for instance, lives depend on it."
Protecting the lives of our children and our most vulnerable citizens has to be a priority.
"While there are many hardworking and dedicated employees at the Department of Human Services, we know that ineffective systemshave lead to tragedy.That’s unacceptable."
That’s why I will work with our agency staff and the legislature to revaluate those systems and ensure we are allocating resources correctly and in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of that agency.
I want to thank outgoing Director Howard Hendrick for his service at DHS.
"I amconfident that Interim Director Terri Whitewillnot only competently manage the transition as the commission searches for a permanent director, but will also actively seek to improve services during her time there."
"Moving forward, our goal should bethat DHS becomes a model for quality services and child protection."
"Inorder to improve services in other areas of state government,you will notice that I have proposed severalsupplemental funding items."
"The first of these items focuses on public safety, which will always be a priority of mine."
We mustincrease the number of troopers we have on the road.
"The currentnumbersaredangerously low due to attrition, retirementsand the lack of a patrol school since 2009.That cannot continue."
"Secondly, the state must keep its commitment to fund teachers’ health benefits."
For that reason I’veincluded a supplemental funding measure for the Department of Education.
Our recent reform measures ask a lot of our teachers; it is important to ensure that we are adequately funding the benefits they have been promised.
"Additionally, the medical examiner’s office –which has long been underfunded and understaffed –requires additional personnel and equipment."
"Because of the positive trajectory of that agency and the capable management provided by our new Chief Medical Examiner Doctor Eric Pfeifer, I am asking for supplemental assistanceon their behalf."
Cities and local municipalitiesalsoneed our help torecover fromextraordinary expenses incurred bynaturaldisasters.
"As you know, the State Emergency Fundisnearly empty and has alarge backlog ofseveral years of expenses."
"That’s not right, so I’m asking you to work with me to refill that fund."
"In addition to these supplemental measures, my budget allocatesadditional funds to the attorney general’s office."
"As you know, the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations have sued the state of Oklahoma concerning who owns the water in 22 counties."
"We continue to hope this issue can be settled through mediation, without huge legal fees, and with all parties negotiating in good faith."
"In the event,however, that the tribes do not share that goal, we intend to defend the water rights of allOklahomans against a claim that favors one group over the interests of the entire state and allof its citizens."
"To ensure we are adequately prepared to do that, the attorney general needs additionalresourcesto retain the very bestcounsel."
"These are not the only priorities, however,that require an additional financial commitment."
The state Capitol building is currently in a state of disrepair.
It’s embarrassingfor our citizens to seebarricades roping off portions of the Capitol.
It’s bad for the image of this state and our efforts to recruit business.
It is our responsibility to maintain this building –which is a symbol of Oklahoma and its people–and that requires funding.
We mustpassabond issue for Capitol repairs.
The people of Oklahoma elected us to make responsible decisions.Let’s do our job. .
The items I have listed above represent the commitments we need to make to adequately fund our state government and provide essential services.That’s a start.
But Oklahomans alsoexpect usto make tough decisions and to take bold steps to move this state forward.
Today I’m askingour lawmakers to join me in an ambitious and exciting undertaking: the passage of a bold tax reform plan that will represent the most significant tax cut in state history.
"The Oklahoma Tax Reduction and Simplification Act willimmediately cut income taxes for Oklahomans in all tax brackets, simplify the tax code, and chart a course towards the gradual elimination of the income tax."
"It willgive Oklahoma the lowest income tax rate in the region besides Texas, making us a more competitive state for those looking to move jobs here."
"Over time, our income tax would be phased out for every Oklahoman."
Our plan is a game-changer for Oklahoma.It’s a job-creator.
And it provides broad based tax relief to the middle class without starving government or hurting the working poor.
It also protects core government services.
"It would,beginning on January 1, 2013,replaceour current system,whichtaxesthe first penny that everyOklahoman makes."
"It reduces the sevenbrackets we currently have to3lower and flatterrates: Those couples making $0 to $30,000 a year will now pay nothing in state taxes."
"For those making $30,000 to $70,000 ayear, the tax rate will be 2.25 percent."
"And for families making over $70,000 a year, the rate will be 3.5 percent, as opposed to the 5.25 percentrate they are currently paying."
"Under these new rates, a middle class couple making $40,000 a year, for example, will pay 37 percent less in taxes in 2013, with additional cuts in future years."
"Thesetax cuts would take placeimmediately,in year one."
"Moving forward, tax rateswould be cut by an additionalquarter point in any year whichthe state of Oklahoma hits a revenue growth trigger of 5%."
That growth trigger gives the state a safety net should we experience another economic downturn.
"I want to commend Representative Dank, Senator Mazzei, many of our legislatorsand others whohave worked to reexamine our tax code and tax incentives."
"We have a common goal: to lessen the tax burden on Oklahomans, and to do it in a responsible manner."
"The question remains, how will we pay for a tax cut?"
"Under the Oklahoma Tax Reduction and Simplification Act, we do it in three ways:First, by eliminatingtax loopholes, carve-outsand other exceptions."
"Second, by continuing to eliminate government waste and makinggovernment more efficient and effective."
We’ve already proven that we can find substantial savings through government modernization initiatives.
"Third, by capitalizing on economic growth we expect to see as a result of our pro-jobs, pro-business policies."
"According to Americans for Prosperity, non-income tax states have seen 59% economic growth over the past decade, versus just 38% for high income tax states."
"Additionally, job growth has increased significantly in non-income tax states, while high tax states have actually lost jobs."
"New jobs and increased investments in Oklahoma will lead to more revenueand increased collections in sales tax, corporate tax,excise tax and more."
"With all of that in mind, I am asking for your support of the OklahomaTax Reduction and Simplification Act, theconservative centerpieceofour pro-jobs agenda."
Send this plan to my desk and let working families keep more of their hard-earned money and provide a higher quality of life for all Oklahomans.
"Another way we can boost Oklahoma’s economy is by supporting one of our most important industries, one that has helped to lead us towards greater prosperity during tough times: the energy industry."
Last November I unveiled Oklahoma’s first comprehensive energy agenda: the Oklahoma First Energy Plan.
"As my taskforce on economic development –or what I like to call my “Game Changer Committee” –noted, acomprehensive energy plan is vital to sustaining economic growth in Oklahoma."
"Oil and natural gas companies support nearly300,000 jobs in the state."
Renewable energies like wind powerare also growing at a fast pace.
"Energy is, in many ways, the backbone of our economy."
And we need policies that reflect that important truth.
"While many in Washington refuseto support the production of American-made energy, Oklahoma is leading the way towards energy independence and domestic energy production."
One area where we have great potential is in natural gas.
Natural gas is an abundant source of energy.
"It is efficient, affordable, clean and produced right here in Oklahoma."
"There are, however, obstacles to increased usage: infrastructure and demand."
It’s a chicken and egg scenario: consumers do not buy natural gas vehicles that can only be refueled at a limited number of gas stations; the private sector doesn’t want to add CNG pumps with only a limited number of consumers.
"That’s why I have launched anunprecedented,bipartisan, multistate initiativeto break that cycle and jump-start both the development of CNG infrastructure and the use of natural gas cars."
"Together with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, I have asked other states to join us in committing to purchase natural gas vehicles for ourstate fleets."
I’m happy to report we now have ten states total who have committed to this project.
"Each state has signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining a goal to purchase, as a group, a minimum of 5,000 NGVs per year."
We believe that commitment will provide the incentive for American car manufacturersto begin producing an affordable natural gas sedan.
By the middleof this yearwe willsubmit a Request for Proposal to automobile companiesasking them to developthat product.
"By supporting natural gas consumption, we are supporting an Oklahoma energy source that will continue to produce Oklahoma jobs."
And this is only the first step in our far-reaching energy agenda.
Oklahoma can and should lead the way in implementing energy efficiency measures that will save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.
I’masking our lawmakers to send mea bill requiring every state agencyand higher education institutiontoreduce energy consumption by 20percentby the year 2020.
"Oklahoma State University has already been a leader in this field, resulting in $19million in savings since 2007."
"If those same practices are extended across state government, we can expect to see statewide savings of at least $300 million over 10years."
Oklahoma has always been a leader in energy production.
"Unfortunately, we have lagged far behind in energy conservation, with taxpayers footing the bill."
"That’s unacceptable, and with the help of the Legislature we can address this problem and become a leader in energy efficiency. . Next, I’m asking you to make a strong commitment to improve Oklahoma’s transportation infrastructure."
"Having safe, modern and functional roads and bridges is vital to commerce and job creation."
"Unfortunately, Oklahoma has been at the top of the national list for bad bridges for years."
That’s something we’re not proud of.
"To address that problem,I have proposedthe “Bridge Improvement and Turnpike Modernization Plan”tofix all 706 of Oklahoma’s structurally deficient state highway bridges by 2019,moving Oklahoma from the list of worst-bridges in the country to the best."
Today I’m asking the legislature to help me meet three goals outlined in this plan.
"First, I am proposing we restore $15 million in motor vehicle revenue back to the transportation budget that had previously been diverted to the general revenue fund."
"Second, I’m asking for your support in raising the cap on the ROADS fund in order to provide the necessary resources to improve our road and bridge system."
"Third, in the transportation plan, we are planning to repurpose 1,500steelbeamsin good condition,taken from the old I-40 Crosstown expressway, to help construct 300 new county bridges."
"To further aid in this project, my plan includes an additional $20 million a year for the construction of county bridges."
"Lastly,our plan relievescongestion on the Creek and Kilpatrick Turnpikes, two of Oklahoma’s most widely travelled roads, without raising taxes or tolls."
The Turnpike Authority has already begun work on that project.
Improving the health of our transportation infrastructure is important .
but equally important is working to improve the health of our citizens.
"Healthy living is important, not just because we want Oklahomans to live full and happy lives, but because the effects of unhealthy life choices hurt our economy, drain taxpayer dollars and drive up the cost of health care for everyone."
Oklahoma iscurrentlyranked 48th in the nation in overall health indicators.That’s unacceptable.
"There are several major factors that hurt our health ranking: obesity, tobacco, poor nutrition, infant mortality, substance abuse and lack of physical activity, just to name a few."
"It’s time to address these problems, move the numbers in the right direction and take control of our own destiny."
"To do that, I have first signed an executive order to prohibit tobacco use on all state property."
We arealsogoing to close the smoking room at the State Capitol and transforming it into a small fitness center.
"To fund this transformation, the state has already applied for a grant from the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust, whichthe Oklahoma Hospital Association has generously agreed to match it."
"Second, my budget uses financial rewards to encourage schools to serve nutritious foods and promote physical activity."
"Third, we are proposing additional funds to enhance our current statewide infant mortality prevention program."
Infant mortality rates in Oklahoma can and must be improved.
"Fourth, 64 of Oklahoma’s77 counties have shortages of health professionals, especially rural physicians.That must change."
"To remedy that, I have included over $3 million to establish 40 new doctor residency slots to help increase the number of primary care physicians in rural and underserved areas in Oklahoma."
"Lastly, I’m asking the legislature to pass a bill reducing liability to schools, so that moms and dads and others from our local communities can join our children in accessing tracks, courts and exercise equipment."
That’s part of an effort lead by the Fit Kids Coalition and the American Heart Association to open school exercise facilities to the public.
All of these initiatives will help Oklahomans to make good choices about their health and get the right care.
"And just like we are asking our citizens to make good decisions about their lifestyles, they have asked us to make good decisions for Oklahomahere in the state capitol."
"Today I’ve outlined a path forward to amore prosperous,better and brighter future for our state and its citizens."
We can get there by allowing Oklahomans to keep more of their hard earned money .
by improving our schools and strengthening our workforce .
byinvestingin our infrastructure.
by beingmore energy efficient .by improving our health .
and bycuttinggovernment waste and buildinga more efficient and effective state government.
"That’s my vision for Oklahoma, and it’s a vision I know that many of you share."
"I’m excited to work with you to pursue that vision, and to watch as the hard work of this Legislature paves the way for another year of growth and forward momentum for our state and, most importantly, our citizens.Thank you for all that you do."
"God bless you, and God bless the great state of Oklahoma."
