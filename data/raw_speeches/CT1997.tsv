There’s always the temptation, in government, to change direction every time there’s an election.

Now is the time to continue forward.
We’ve chosen a new path.
Let’s stay the course!
In one month I will be here again with my budget proposal for the next two years.
The budget I present to you in February will once again hold the line on the growth of spending and reduce taxes.
In the fight against wasteful spending there can be no retreat.

And the cuts we choose to make must benefit as many people as possible.
We all realize, the gas tax increases approved by the previous administration, are nothing less than highway robbery and we will make cuts in the gas tax this session.
Our effort to cut the gas tax must be responsible, because while the roads and bridges of Connecticut are far better than they were ten years ago, there is still work to be done, and that work will not be abandoned.
And make no mistake, the income tax picks the pockets of the working people of Connecticut every week - cutting into the size of their take home pay and robbing them of disposable income that could be used to fuel the state’s economy, increase savings, or put children through college.

In the final half of the 1990’s it’s our job to redirect our limited resources to those who truly need our help and empower everyone to achieve their dreams.
We can’t move forward by standing still.
"We can’t afford to say ""no"" to new ideas and initiatives just because they’re different from the way we’ve done it in the past."
Even as we finish work on our next budget, my administration is hard at work, exploring changes that can be made two years from now.
Some of the changes we’re considering won’t benefit us in the current budget cycle, but they should pay off, for everyone, in the years to come.
For example; it’s time to admit state government is not suited to manage and maintain its own computer systems.
Every day we resist finding a better way, is another day we deny the people of Connecticut the best services available to them.
It’s time to consider the huge savings we might realize - for everyone - by taking advantage of the state’s buying power when providing health care to the clients of our state agencies.
We can no longer afford to pay a premium price when we can get the same services at lower cost.
When considering new ideas, and new challenges, we must remember we are not here to represent ourselves, or the special interests, seeking their piece of the public pie.
We represent only one special interest group: the people of Connecticut.
During the upcoming session one of our greatest challenges will be education reform.
The Sheff vs. O’Neill case has given this Legislature a chance to make a lasting impact on education in our state and we are not going to let this session pass by without meeting that challenge.

We have an extraordinary opportunity during this session to continue Connecticut’s comeback and permanently change the course of state government by ending its habitual growth.
We were not elected to protect the work of those who have come before us.
The only constant in government should be our commitment to the people.
We are rich with ideas, and strengthened by the fortitude that comes from weathering tough economic times.
For the first time in this decade the people of Connecticut can count on a brighter future with lower taxes, better jobs and more opportunity.
Let’s work together to realize our vision of a new Connecticut for ourselves, our families, and future generations.
Thank you and God bless.
