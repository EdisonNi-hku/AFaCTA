And when we are one, anything is achievable!

I've seen it during the Olympics, floods, fires, festivals and war.
It is an awesome thing when unity happens, enough to humble any governor.

As Utahns we don't have to look too far for examples of that spirit.

I'm sorry to have to say it again this year, but skyrocketing healthcare costs are bankrupting businesses and leaving too many Utahns with no options at all.
In a state as compassionate as ours, certainly we can find a better way to cover the uninsured.
I recently visited a public health clinic in St. George.
Due to the goodness of volunteer doctors and staff, 10,000 people were seen last year, this in a city of 70,000.
Why?
One out of every seven people in Dixie must go to a volunteer clinic to receive adequate health care?
These people have been completely left out of the healthcare equation; they don't qualify for existing programs, and they can't afford a basic healthcare plan.
So, to Dr. Doxey - who started this volunteer clinic - and the staff there, I say thank you for your humanitarianism.
I assure you and those you serve, we will fix this problem.
We are going to find policies that are affordable, the political will to enact them and, through perseverance, provide a pathway to coverage for everyone.
Therefore, I am asking all involved: doctors, insurance companies, consumers and we in this chamber to close the gap on the uninsured by 2012.
Let's begin this session by passing the task force legislation shepherded by Speaker David Clark and Senator Sheldon Killpack to develop a truly affordable insurance policy.
But this is not enough.
We must connect all people to the healthcare they need.
A truly affordable policy and the means by which to connect all people will be done in this state, this year!
Though we are one in community, we are many in number.
Utah is now the fastest-growing state in America.
People are flocking here for the unmatched quality of life, high-paying jobs and the essence of everything we love about America.
We also continue our trend of being the youngest state in the union.
These are tremendous attributes, but if unplanned for, they can carry a significant burden.
We hold dear the things that give us a sense of humanity - our land, our air and our water - and recognize the role they play in our peace of mind and spirit, as well as our economy.
If we are going to take air quality seriously, which we must for the sake of the next generation, we must be bold; we must be visionary.
Our aspirations should be nothing short of extraordinary.
And there are two goals that we should immediately set our sights on.
First, just as Wall Street is known for finance and Silicone Valley for technology, by 2012, I believe Utah can become the premier destination in America for renewable energy!
And don't tell me it can't be done!
In just this past year alone, we have witnessed in Utah the opening of a solar farm, a hydroelectric plant, a wind farm and a geothermal plant.
To support this energy development, innovation at our higher education campuses is running at an all-time high, like technologies that will ensure the long-term viability of our abundant natural resources.
The University of Utah is now second only to MIT in commercialization of cutting-edge research.
But this is just the beginning!
We will be the epicenter for energy development - but we must have the land, transmission, and regulatory framework to make it a reality.
We must look beyond 20th century mentalities and bet on 21st century realities.
We must pass legislation this year to incentivize, rather than penalize, innovative technologies where the risk is real, but the reward is great.
Our second goal will be to designate Interstate 15 from Idaho to Arizona as a natural gas corridor!
It makes sense - working with Questar, a great local company - to encourage the use of natural gas which emits almost no pollution, is more affordable and most importantly, is a domestic fuel found right here in our own backyard; getting Utah, and the nation, one step closer to breaking our addiction to foreign oil.
This will require adding infrastructure, looking differently at our regulatory approach and demanding that we look beyond the here and now.
As a state, we are leading with innovative solutions to ensure better access and services to our citizens, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Some Utahns may be surprised to know that more than 850 government services now can be found online - which is why we have been recognized as the Number 1 state in the country for Digital Government!
But as we have moved into the digital age, I am concerned that some of our time-tested values have been left behind.
In the past year, we've seen our nation's financial pillars crumble, and not because we have a deficit of talented people.
I would suggest there is one common thread: a deficit of ethics.
There is a complete disconnect with our nation's best and brightest.
They have been taught to be brilliant on Wall Street without concern for their impact on Main Street.
Whether in business, politics or community affairs, correcting this deficit of ethics is just as important as overcoming our economic struggles.
Closer to home, there is a deficit of another kind, and no less disturbing.
Unfortunately, in Utah we are seeing a weakening in our own pillars of democracy.
We've long been recognized as a community known for its patriotism and public spiritedness, yet as the nation has seen an upswing in voter turnout, we are seeing just the opposite.
This apathy is corrosive to a stable and functioning democracy.
We must restore trust.
We must restore confidence.
We must reach out, particularly to our youth, to reinvigorate the democracy they will inherit.
This is the purpose of the newly-announced Commission on Strengthening Utah's Democracy, because without public support and participation we have no democracy.
One of our most passionate and respected community leaders has taken our call to action.
And you know this guy - I want to thank Larry H. Miller for his willingness to lead this effort!
Our prayers are with him tonight as he recovers from recent surgery.
When times are good economically, as we have seen in recent years, we sometimes become preoccupied with our own selfish interests.
But when times get tough, we are reminded of the power of our community, of people reaching across boundaries to help others, reawakening the need to improve the human condition.
Though it is warmer tonight in this chamber than it was three weeks ago on the front steps of the Capitol when I was sworn in, outside there are single moms without homes, children without dinner, and many without work.
I reiterate my call to all who can hear me: find someone in need and help them - whether it be a neighbor, a friend or a perfect stranger.
We all have something to give, even if it is just a hand to hold, and there are so many in need right now.
It is through the spirit of service that a community is born.
It is this same sense of service that is displayed by so many, like our men and women in uniform serving overseas; pastors and preachers, many of whom I've worshipped with; those looking out for our most vulnerable - people like Pamela Atkinson, a true community advocate, Jim Pugh at the Utah Food Bank, and Matt Minkevitch at the Road Home.
It is because of community leaders like these that I know we will prevail!
And we will continue to occupy our rightful and well-earned position as the greatest state in America.
The journey is up to us and the decisions made by this very body will lead us there.
This is the time to unite with one purpose and one mind.
Because together we can succeed.
Together we will thrive.
Together we will overcome.
Together we are one.
May God bless you and the great State of Utah!
