SENTENCES
"Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Speaker Murphy, Members of the General Assembly, Justices of the Supreme Court, Judges of the Court of Appeals, Members of the Consular Corps, other honored guests, my fellow Georgians."
"I return to this beautiful place, in the process of being restored to its former grandeur, with respect and fond memories."
For I have spent most of my adult life in these chambers of the General Assembly.
"In the 24 years since I first arrived as a young, idealistic member, I have witnessed history and maybe participated in some of it."
"But, most of all, I have seen the changes that make Georgia the State she is today."
It is here where I first listened to the debate over whether it was wise for Georgia children to have the advantages of kindergarten and then pre-K.
It was here I heard the debate over a new Constitution for a changing Georgia.
"It was here where I first participated in the debate over how, and if, we should re-examine the way we educate our children and institute Quality Basic Education."
"And it was here where I watched Georgia transform from a sleepy, backwater state into the fastest growing state in the South -- the third fastest in the nation."
"And, yes, it was also here where I saw the arrival of a political species previously unknown to us -- Republicans."
Georgia is a great state today because of all of these changes.
"My message to you is that if we are to continue in our growth, we must continue in our change."
"Today, we must re-examine our long held beliefs and ideas; if they do not meet our modern needs, it is our duty to cast them aside."
"We must plan not for next year's election, but for the next century's progress."
"For if we fail, if we are divided by our partisan differences and refuse to meet our new challenges head on, we will compromise our future -- as well as our children's."
First and foremost I must say--the State of our State is strong!
Our economy is growing and we have cut our welfare rolls by almost 50 percent.
"Thanks to HOPE Scholarships, more of our high school graduates are going on to college."
"And more of our children are receiving the advantages of pre-K than ever before.Today, Georgia is a leader."
"Not just the Capital of the New South, but soon to be a Capital for the New Century."
"Today, Georgia stands on the threshold of a remarkable future."
It is an awesome time in the history of our state.
"And those of you in this room today, those of you who have a deep and abiding commitment to our State, you have the ability to bring that brilliant future home."
"You have the ability to build a bridge from here to there, from this century to the next, and to take this state from a mere flash in the pan to one that is rock steady and ready for any challenge."
"But just as we are experiencing our greatest economic boom ever, we're also experiencing one of our worst periods of public disillusionment."
"I spent all of last year traveling this state, and I'm here to tell you that the people of our state are frustrated."
The people have lost faith in politicians because politicians have stopped listening.
"What I heard people say last November was this: ""I want someone to stand up for me and deal with the problems that affect my life."
Someone who'll stop the bickering and put our problems ahead of partisan politics.
"I heard people say they want our train of progress to continue, but they want it to stop at places that have, for far too long, missed out."
Places like Albany that are struggling to rebuild their downtown.
Places like Brunswick that are trying to create new jobs by increasing international trade.
Places like South Atlanta and South DeKalb that are trying to wipe out urban blight by attracting new business and industry.
Places all across this state that badly need new roads to connect them to economic prosperity.
We need federal transportation dollars to keep flowing into our state.
And the people of Georgia expect us to make sure that it happens.
"But instead of dealing with our transportation and pollution problems, agencies and governments have for far too long passed the buck, and we are about to lose more than 900 million federal dollars this year -- almost 5 billion dollars in the years to come."
"Well, today I am here to say the buck stops here."
"Either we do something to solve our problems or every developmental highway, every road improvement project, every bridge, tunnel or passing lane you ever promised for your communities is coming to a screeching halt."
Either you help me do something now or this boomtown known as Atlanta becomes a ghost town.
"And if our growth stops here, it stops everywhere in the state."
"Everybody wants to blame somebody, but the honest, decent thing is just to tell the truth.We're all to blame."
We all must shoulder a part of the responsibility for the mess we've gotten ourselves into.
It's time to stop pointing fingers and start doing something.
"If we fail to confront this problem, the economic engine driving our state will stall."
"If we fail to confront this problem, the wealth of jobs we hope to create for our new graduates will dry up."
"If we fail to confront this problem, our quality of life, our air and water quality, our very ability to get to and from our homes will change for the worse."
"Earlier this week, I released the details of how I hope a new state agency will work."
It will co-ordinate and resolve differences in the planning of transportation in the 13 counties around Atlanta.
It will also have the power to operate a mass transit system.
All major developments within the metro area that create increased traffic and increased sprawl will be subject to the agency's approval.
"At the same time, I have been sensitive to the concerns of local governments and other agencies by requiring a supermajority vote for most actions."
"Furthermore, I have allowed local governments to overrule the authority in certain circumstances."
"By building checks and balances into the process, I believe we create new incentives for governments and agencies to work with each other to solve our common problems."
I believe this plan ensures that one voice will not dominate the process.
"And I also believe this plan ensures that no one voice, or one set of interests, will stand in the way of progress."
I have drawn on all of my experiences over the years working with you and with the people of our state to draft this legislation.
"I know it's not perfect, but it's the best I know how to do."
"So before you or anyone else makes a rush to judgement, consider the alternatives."
"And remember, if you know of any magic wand out there that can wipe away our air and transportation problems, drop it off at the Governor's Office--I've got several other thorny issues I need help on."
"As I criss-crossed the state listening to people's problems last year, I also heard thousands of people say it's time to do something about health care."
"For far too long, insurance bureaucrats have gotten between patients and their doctors.This must end."
"Just as many Georgia families have watched their choice in doctors rapidly decrease, the cost of insurance for many individuals and small businesses struggling to make it has gone through the roof."
"In some cases, they are denied coverage altogether.This also must end."
"And, for far too long, many families have been left in the dark about crucial issues that affect their health."
"Patients and their families have the right to know why they have been refused medical care, and they have the right to know when doctors have been forbidden to discuss certain treatment options."
Another reoccurring story I heard last year was that treatment is often delayed because patients are forced to wait for decisions coming from insurance bureaucrats.
"These delays have resulted in increased injury, sickness and death.This must end, too."
These stories I heard are not isolated incidents.
"This can happen to you, to me, and to our families."
The problem of getting good health care at a fair price is one that each of us faces every day.
That's why I have proposed the creation of an Insurance Consumer Advocate to tackle the problems of high insurance rates.
The people of Georgia are entitled to have their own spokesperson who will once and for all represent only their interests and not the interests of the insurance companies.
I will also introduce legislation to reign in the worst excesses of HMOs and managed care.
The time has come to draw a line in the sand.
"A line that, for the first time in this state, clearly defines a patient's bill of rights."
A line that puts the HMOs on notice.
A line that clearly tells insurance lobbyists that we will honor every Georgian's right to choose his or her own doctor.
"From the first colonists to land on these shores, freedom of choice has been a part of our heritage."
"It is ingrained in our history -- and, soon, I hope, it will even apply to insurance companies."
"So let me say again, we are here to do the work of the people, to help solve their problems."
We are not here to look after the lobbyists who walk these halls and corridors.
"We are not here to cater to lobbyists who, right now, are waiting for you to come out of this chamber."
"Who are going to try and tell you how everyone's rates are going up because of this plan, how businesses will be forced to drop policies, even how the sky is going to fall and famine and pestilence will be our fate.Don't believe them."
You know they're not telling you the truth.
That's what they're paid to say.
Beware of their eel-skinned briefcases and alligator shoes.It's their job to scare us.It's their job to divide us.
It's their job to put a wedge between us and what the people want and demand - and need.
I know we can do this without raising rates.
"And I know the people want us to do it, and do it now."
"When it comes to delivering good care at a fair price, state government should provide an example to the private sector."
That's why I have a proposal that I will send to the General Assembly to improve the way state government delivers health care -- by taking all the state agencies that are currently delivering health services and bringing them together.
The way we currently deliver health care just doesn't make good sense.
"For example, over in the Department of Medical Assistance, we have administrators and bureaucrats providing Medicaid for some 1.2 million low-income residents; over in the State Health Planning Agency we have folks making decisions about the size and scope of our health care facilities; and then, we also have two more agencies running health benefits for state employees."
What this has created is a mountain of cost and confusion.
"Each of these departments has a different set of administrators, a different set of agendas."
By bringing this all under one roof we will save money and inspire confidence.
Creating a single Department of Community Health in state government will give us the ability to maximize purchasing power.
"State government is already Georgia's largest purchaser of health care, covering over 26 percent of our state population."
It is time to use this financial buying power to save our taxpayers money.
But we have never attempted to coordinate our health care purchases to leverage cost savings.
"In other words, we don't know how to buy in bulk."
This new agency will also minimize duplication and maximize administrative efficiency -- cut out red tape and streamline programs.
"If we truly want to restore trust and confidence in our government, we must be above reproach."
That's why two weeks ago I signed an order barring my staff and the executive branch from receiving gifts-- especially from lobbyists and other people who do business with the state.
"And this week, I am proposing legislation to strengthen our Open Records laws to make public access to our public records surer, faster, and more comprehensive."
"As more government functions have been privatized, more and more records have been removed from the Open Records Act because they are now records of private entities."
"In other words, one of the unintended side effects of privatization has been making government less open.My proposal will remedy that."
It will prevent government employees from using excuses and unreasonable delays to circumvent our law.
"And, perhaps most important of all, it will put real teeth in the Open Records Act by providing criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations."
We must be willing to change the way we do business if we hope to live up to the responsibilities that go along with being public servants.
What I am proposing this year are not lofty concepts far removed from the daily struggles of ordinary Georgians.
They are proposals that directly effect the lives of the people we serve.
"That is why two weeks ago, during my Budget Address, I asked for your help in giving Georgia residents a much-needed tax break, an 83 million dollar property tax cut that will help young and old alike realize the dream of home ownership."
Each one of us here today plays an important role in restoring trust and confidence in our political system.
"The people of Georgia want leaders they can trust, leaders they can admire, leaders who can serve as role models for their children.We can be those examples."
"More importantly, we must be those examples."
And the best way for us to do that is to give the people of our state the tools they want and need for a prosperous future.
"Whether it's improving education, reducing pollution, creating equal, economic opportunity or making health care fair and accessible, we must get a better grasp of the problems facing our state and begin to find the solutions that will make us great in the 21st century."
We have much to do in the next 32 days -- let's get to it.
