"There is more that unites us than divides us, and one of those things is the Baltimore Ravens!!"
"!All of us are familiar with the Ravens story, but there are alsoa number of remarkable people with us here today in the Galleryand I wanted to share a few of their stories with you now."
"First, one of our nation’s leading minds and most prominent advocates for science, technology, engineering, and math education."
You may know him as a member of our State School Board.
"Later this week, President Obama will be awardinghimthe National Medal of Sciencefor his achievement in physics–Dr."
"James Gates.1Two years ago, this next Marylander and her children were homeless."
"Today, she’s turned a temporary work placement into a good, full-time job."
"Please welcome Janice Spanish from Caroline County and the dedicated state employee from our Department of Human Resources who helped hersecure this opportunity, Melissa Jones-Harris.2Within the heart of every individual is a spirit and dignity that yearns to be recognized."
"Twelve months ago, just outside these doors, we officially recognized for the first time in 380 yearsthe Piscataway people, in a ceremony none of us will soon forget."
"Please welcome Tribal Chair Mervin Savoy of the Piscataway Conoy Tribe.3We are also joined by a great Mayor, who,because of budget constraints also serves as City Manager."
"When his own home was flooded during Hurricane Sandy, he set aside his personal needs and instead worked day and night to help the families of his city through the crisis."
From the courageous City of Crisfield–Mayor P. J. Purnell.
"INTRODUCTIONMy fellow Marylanders: the story of Dr. Gates, the story of Janice and Melissa, the story of Tribal Chair Savoy and all the Piscataway people,the story of Crisfield and of Mayor Purnell, the sacrificesof our fallen heroes–theseare ourstories.Stories of courage.Stories of perseverance."
It is a tremendous honor to serve the people of Maryland.
"When faced with the adversity of the national recession, the people of our State did not make excuses."
"Instead, they started businesses.They enrolled in night school."
They made difficult decisions around the kitchen table about how to do more for their children.
"They volunteered through churches, synagogues, and mosques."
They pulled their neighbors through Hurricane Sandy and the heavy blizzard that struck Garrett County.
"What we have experienced, together, over these last several years."
"what we have shared with one another, was not denial.It was not fear.Nor was it merely hope.It was belief."
Our belief in the dignity of every individual.
Our belief in our own responsibility to advance the common good.
"Our belief that we are all in this together,and that tomorrow can be better than today –if, with God's grace, we choose to make it so.Progress is a choice.Job creation is a choice."
"Whether we give our children a future ofmore or a future of less–this,too,is a choice."
"Our story, Maryland’s story, is the story of better choices and better results."
"No other state can sayat once, that they are#1 in education five years in a row.4#1 in holding down the cost of collegetuition.5#1 in innovation and entrepreneurship.6#1 in human capital capacity.7#1 in access to dental care for all children,regardless of income.8#1 in PHD scientists and researchers.9#1 in Research and Development.10#1 in businesses owned by women.11#1 in median family income.12And we’re not done yet."
"As we emerge from the toughest of economic times, the State of our State is strong, and we are growing strongerstill."
None of this happened by chance.
BETTER CHOICES;BETTER RESULTSRemember seven years ago?
Our State had veered off course.
"We started following the same, never-mind-the-math approach that created our federal deficits."
"Democrats and Republicans alike –in this very Chamber –had voted to cut taxes for millionaires, andto greatly increase state spending, without paying for either one."
"The result: a $1.7 billion structural deficit.13What’s less, we were paying taxes for a government thatwas not working; thatwas failing to deliver results."
"Underperforming schools.14Tuition hikes approaching 40%.15Rising crime outside of Baltimore.16But in 2007, together, we started making better choices."
We cut spending growth.17We added a penny to the sales taxto improve our children’s education.18We restored revenues by making our tax code more progressive and fair.19We took concrete action to close our structural deficit.20When the national recession hit –wiping out jobs and revenuesall across our country–other states tried to cut their way to prosperity.
Many found this only made things worse.
"Laying off police officers,21fire fighters and teachers.22Cutting public education.23Hikingupcollege tuition by double digits every single year.24Continuing down the merry path of cutting taxes for the very wealthy,25hoping against cruel experience that somehow it would trickledown to the rest of their citizens."
"But in Maryland, we made better choices."
We used the pressure of sinking revenues to make government more efficient.
"For the first time, we started setting publicgoals with more immediate deadlines."
"We started measuring weekly performance to make government more effective.26We constrained budget growth27and made government smaller.28We strengthened our Rainy Day Fund29and protected our Triple A Bond Rating.30We fixed our pension system.31We reformed hundreds of pages of regulations,32streamlined permitting,33and fast tracked jobs projects.34We eliminated paperwork, simplified applications for business licenses, and reduced waiting times from months to days.35We advanced public-private partnerships to create thousands of jobs at the Port of Baltimore.36 We put real-time information aboutthe people’s government on the internet, converted paper notecards to digital files, and used smart maps to better target our limited resources.37We cut more state spending than any administration in modern Maryland history.38Recognizing that our diversity is our greatest strength, we moved forward toward the most ambitious goal in America for empowering women and minority owned businesses."
"And this year, for the first timewe exceeded it.39Knowing that we could not cut our way to prosperity, we balanced record budget cuts with modern investments."
"Investmentsin the very priorities that create jobs and expand opportunity: educating, innovating, and rebuilding for a better economic future.Better choices.Better results.The proof is in ourprogress."
"Progress recovering jobs at the fastest rate of any state in our region.40Progress helping more of our neighbors transition from welfare to work –12,000 people last year alone.41Progress teaming with businesses large, medium and small to create more jobs –30,300 jobs over the last twelve months."
"Together with courageous law enforcement officers and firefighters, we are driving down violent crime,42driving down homicide,43and driving down fire deaths44–all to historic lows."
"We are doing more than any other state to hold down the cost of college tuition.45We are helping more families save their homes from foreclosure.46 We are reducing infant mortality to record lows.47We are now feeding tens of thousandsofMaryland children who otherwise would go hungry.48We are doing more than ever before to shelter the homeless.49We are healing families,50and helping our neighbors free themselves from the despair of substance abuse.51We are moving record cargo through our Port,52and record passengers through Baltimore-Washington’s Thurgood Marshall Airport.53Our actions are making the waters of the Chesapeake Bay healthier–rescuing the Blue Crab; reviving our Native Oyster;54more farmers than ever restoring the waters of ourBay by planting cover crops.55And our record investments in public education are delivering record high student achievement.56Record high graduation rates.57An historic closing of the achievement gaps between white and non-white students.58The bestAdvanced Placementscores in science, technology, engineering, and math our students have ever achieved.59The best overall AP scores of any state in the nation.60For not one, not two, not three, not four, but five years in a row–the #1 ranked, best public school system in the United States of America!In the toughest of times, we moved forward, not back."
JOBS AND EDUCATIONThese are the choices we have alreadymade.
Now to the choices ahead of us.
"Job creation must be our top priority, always."
"While we are recovering jobs faster than any other state in our region, still too many moms and dads are out of work, and searching for work."
"Therefore, this year’s budget is a jobs budget: it invests in 43,000 jobs rebuilding roads,bridges, tunnels, community colleges, affordable housing units, clean water infrastructure, and other forward-looking projects.61It protects nearly 26,000 law enforcement jobsthroughout our State.62Itsupports over114,000 jobs educatingour children.63This jobs budget invests to improve public education and to build new schools."
"It accelerates the transition from chalk and textbooks in our classrooms, to iPads, laptops, smart-boards, and 21stcentury digital learning tools.64Andonce again,it holds down the cost of college tuition."
This progress is only possible with fiscal responsibility and a balanced approach.
The budget before you saves more than recommended by the Spending Affordability Guidelines.
It increases both our Rainy Day Fund and our Cash Reserves.65It protects our Triple A Bond Rating.
"It very nearly eliminatesthe structural deficit.66And, it brings our total spending cuts to $8.3 billion dollarsover the life of this administration."
"These are the choices which enable us toinvest in a stronger and better future: more job creation, more opportunity, and a stronger, growing middle class."
"Innovation & Entrepreneurship Three stories, allwith a common theme:We are joined today in the Gallery by an inventor and entrepreneur."
He reached out to 200 college professors asking for lab space.He received 199 rejections.
He went on to invent an inexpensive tool for detecting pancreatic and ovarian cancers –which he has patented.
"8,500 of our fellow citizens selected him as the winner of our MDForward contest."
"What’s more, the people at Intel selected him for their top International Science and Engineering prize.He happens to be 15 years old."
"Buy stock in this guy andplease welcome Jack Andrakaand his proud mother, Jane.67We’re also joined by a small businessowner from Havre de Grace, who also happens to be a courageous, disabled veteran."
She moved her business out of her own dining room and into a store front on South Union Avenue.
Now she’s tripledher customers.
Please welcome Sergeant Leana Nishimura-Stewart.
"I had occasion to visit with this next gentleman in Frederick, Maryland."
He started a company called Nexus EnergyHomes.
"They buildhouses at market prices –and get this, these homes are designed toconsume net zero energy."
"For families, that means energy bills as lowas $3 or $4 a month."
"For the people of Frederick,it means hundreds of jobs."
Nexus EnergyHomes wasa national “home builder of the year”last year.
"Their CEO, Paul Zaneckialso joins us in the Gallery.68What do these stories have in common?"
Innovation and entrepreneurship.
The United States Chamber of Commerce named Maryland #1 in innovation and entrepreneurship for a reason.
"And it’s a reason to do more, not a reason to do less."
"From net zero homes, to mapping the human genome, Marylanders are doing remarkable work that is remaking our world."
"The life sciences, bio-tech, clean-tech, green-tech, information technology, cyber security, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing–these sectors are all creating jobs right here in Maryland."
Creating jobs through innovation is not just the responsibility of the private sector.
"There are things we can do together –through the common platform of our government –to accelerate innovation and improve the business climate: Attracting venture capital through InvestMaryland.69Moving more new technologies and ideas out of our university labs, and into the marketplace for job creation.70Leveraging our first-in-the-nation health-ITnetwork.71Supporting Lt. Governor Brown’s efforts to advance the use of public-private partnerships.72Expanding our successful job creation tax credits for biotech,73and research and development.74And, by creating a new cyber securitytaxcredit.75There’s another important thing we can do this yearto create jobs, and that is off-shore wind."
"Moving forward with Atlantic off-shore wind could make Maryland, the new regional manufacturing hub for wind turbines."
"We will create jobs andwe will generate abundant, clean, renewable energy, but only if we choose.76Let’s get this done."
"Maryland’s WorkforceUltimately,the greatest economic assets we have are the talents and skills of our people."
Maryland has built up one of the most highly skilled workforces in the country.77Better choices; better results.
But the reality is that too many of the new jobs being created in our new economy go unfilled.Why?
Because too many of our people lack the skills to fill them.
"Your vote on the EARN bill, will allow us to partner with business to equip more of our workers with the skills they need to fill the jobs that are in highest demand.78Speaking of skilled workers,veterans returning from active duty service facebarriers to employment in every state."
"Oftentimes, this barrier is the state’s own licensing system."
"In Maryland, we can remove those barriersfor veterans and their spouses, with your vote for the Veterans Full Employment Act.79We’ve made solid progressexpanding Career & Technology Education in our high schools.80But there is so much more that we can and must do."
"If lifelong learningisthe new reality, then we mustgive our high school graduates the skills they need for life long earning."
"Prince George’s Community College and the County’s public schools have an innovative solution: let motivated high schools students work toward both their two-year Associates Degree andtheir high school diploma –at the same time.81With your vote, we can make this sort of early access to affordable college credit a reality for more families across our State.82Which brings me tothe challenge ofcollege completion."
"Business leaders I meet with throughout our State tell me we are simply not producing enough college graduates –especially in science, technology, engineering, and math."
We’ve done a good job ofgetting more of our childrentocollege.
"But we must do a better job of getting more of our students throughcollege.83Our community colleges are really deliveringresults: last year they graduated 49% more students than they graduated five years ago.84They’ve increased production,and this year I’m asking you to increase their funding so they can do even more."
We need to pick up the pace at our four-year colleges.
"Here are some things we can do, together with our university system,that work: we can redesign college curricula and courses to better promote completion.85We can move our system toward rewarding a student’s competency, and not merely the years he or she spends sitting in a lecture hall.86We can rework financial aid so that more students can afford to carry fullcourse loads to complete their degreeson or ahead of time.87And we can give students more online options for earning college credit."
"We can reachour goals,but we’re going to have to make better choices if we want better results."
"A Modern Transportation Network There’s another major job creation action we could take, but so far the consensus has alluded us."
We have the worst traffic congestion in the country.88Building a 21stcentury transportation network won’t happen by itself.
We could be creating thousands of jobs and alleviating traffic congestion at the same time.
"We can either figure this out together, or every citizen in our State will continue to waste more time and more money sitting in more traffic.To govern is to choose."
PUBLIC SAFETYThe most fundamental responsibility of any government is public safety.
It is the passion for improving public safety that drove me into public service.
"Thanks to the brave work of law enforcement officers, thanks to better technology, thanks to better strategies, we have driven violent crime down nearly 25% since 2006.Every life is needed.Every life is important."
And every day there is more that we must do.
We lose too many American lives to gun violence.
"Who can watch the sad images of the last several weeks,who can see the pictures of those young faces, and honestly say we’re doing enough?Louis in Montgomery County,who joins us also the Gallery, writes, quote: ""My wife Dorothy,."
"and I urgently request your ardent support for a comprehensive ban on all deadly assault weapons,."
I am a 92-year old veteran of WWII who spent four years in the service of my beloved country.
I believe fervently in our Constitution.
"What I do not believe in is the,."
"right to own weapons which should only be used by the military,."
"Fouryears ago, this Assembly took action to protect the victims of domestic violence from the threat of guns.89This year, I ask you to take further action,and in a comprehensive way."
"I ask you to ban the sale of military-style assault weaponsin Maryland.90I ask you to require a license for the purchase of all handguns–but not hunting rifles.91I ask that you help improve mental health treatment and information sharing, and to expand crisis intervention.92I also ask that you invest in security upgrades in our schools.93Last year, the people of Prince George’s County teamed with their police department to save 31 more lives, by driving down homicides 33%.94Effectives tactics, rapid deployment, relentless follow-up –there are things we can do that work to save lives."
"Since2009, we haveused forensic DNA technology to take 520 murderers, rapists, and other violent criminals off Maryland’s streets."
"We need to renew our DNA law this year, because DNA technology is a strategy that works."
"Effective policing, the Violence Prevention Initiativeat Parole & Probation,95license plate readers,96digital fingerprinting technology97–these things work,and we should do more of them."
"But when we realize that something isn’t working and it is also expensive, we should stop doing it."
The death penalty is expensive and it does not work.It is not a deterrent.
It cannot be administered without racial bias.
It costs three times as much as locking someone up for life without parole.
And it cannot be reversed if an innocent person is executed.98 It is time to repeal the death penalty in Maryland and replace it with life without parole.
"Consider this: across our ever-more-closely connected world, the majority of executions now take place in just seven countries: Iran.Iraq.The People’s Republic ofChina.North Korea.Saudi Arabia.Yemen."
"And the United States of America.99CONCLUSIONI leave you with these thoughts:Life is an evolving story of changeand choice–a letting go of things and ways that were, in order to reach for that which we have yet toachieve."
"It is not some random shuffling of the deck, or a tossing of cards."
"Life is an intentional process, and it calls for the goodness of our own intentions."
"We, in Maryland, are called to work at the center of this intentional movement."
"For every decision we make, there is a future foretold."
"Jobs and opportunity; public safety, public education, public transportation, the health of our people and the health of our planet."
These are our concerns; and these are the world’s concerns.
"It comes to this: do we believe the challenges facing our State and our country are things that are happening ""to us,"" or things that are happening ""for us?"""
"If we believe they are happening tous, then we are victims."
"If we believe they are happening for us, then every problem is a means to deeper understanding, to greater growth, to more security, and more opportunity.Let me be specific."
We are one of the most vulnerable states in our country to the impact of sea-level rise.Climate disruption is real.
Climate change is not an ideological issue any more than gravity is.
"It is physics, pure and simple.100Maryland might not be able tochange what people in India or China do with respect to climate."
"We can, however, use the prospect of a carbon constrained world as the means to invent a more prosperous future, and to drive innovation,education, industry,jobs, and growth."
"We are a state, yes; but, we can also act like the heart of a forward-moving country whose eyes and ears are open to the world."
Weneed only the courage to let go.
"To let go of the falsehoods, the vengeance, the short-sightedness of rash and imbalanced decisions–the things of our past that no longer serve."
"And once leaving them behind, we shall have the reach to make a new world –free from fear,and worthy of our children's loveand trust.Thank you."
