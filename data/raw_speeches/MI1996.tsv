Introduction Lieutenant Governor Binsfeld, Senate Majority Leader Posthumus, Speaker Hillegonds, senators and representatives; Chief Justice Brickley, justices, and judges; Secretary Miller, General Kelley, and all my colleagues in government, including a warm welcome to Michigan's Congressional delegation; and especially Michigan families and citizens: Thank you, once again, for this opportunity to review the state of our state and to chart a bold course for our future.
"In 1991, moments before I took my oath of office, Governor George Romney looked me in the eye and said, ""Whatever you do, be bold!"""
"Michigan said ""good-bye"" to Governor Romney this past year."
George knew that the mosaic of Michigan has not been composed with pale pastels, but with bold colors -- like the man himself.
He left us an outstanding legacy of service as a leader and volunteer in our state and nation.
And Michigan misses him.
This evening, we are honored to have with us Lenore, George's beloved wife of more than 50 years.
Lenore, you and George are in our thoughts and prayers.
Also in our thoughts and prayers are the Michigan men and women on active duty -- in Bosnia, Haiti and other trouble-spots around the world: 54 Michigan National Guard soldiers are in Haiti for Operation Uphold Democracy; 181 Michigan National Guard soldiers are in Germany in support of Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia; 69 soldiers in the Michigan Army Reserve's 415th Battalion from Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo have also been deployed in Operation Joint Endeavor.
Indeed, to all the men and women with Michigan roots who are currently in the armed services, we thank you for upholding the blessings of peace and freedom at home and abroad.
Our Accomplishments Those of us present this evening celebrate many blessings and achievements.
One blessing is the presence of a dear friend who, one year ago, could not be with us.
Connie, we are delighted to have you back and presiding tonight.
I particularly want to applaud our Lieutenant Governor for her tireless advocacy on behalf of children.
Her work on adoption reform has been a great success.
And her leadership of the Lieutenant Governor's Children's Commission is of extraordinary importance.
Connie's Commission is attempting to answer some of the most difficult questions our society faces.
If child abuse occurs, should parents get a second chance?
What is in the best interests of the child?
I share Connie's determination not to let children languish or become pawns in the system.
We must do better by our children!
It was just five years ago that I stood here in this Capitol, this symbol of democracy, and addressed you for the first time.
No one -- including myself -- foresaw how far we'd come, how much we'd accomplish, and how dramatically Michigan would re-emerge as a national leader.
The changes we have wrought are more than incremental; they are generational.
We have done so much, so quickly, that the impact of our Taxpayers' Agenda is only now being fully comprehended.
Make no mistake: We've made Michigan a better place to work, to raise a family, and to make the American dream come true.
When you add it all up, together we have made history -- and the state of our state is better than ever!
More important than changing any rule or law, we have changed Michigan -- and in the process we have changed the terms of the debate.
Our focus is not only on what government should do .
. . but on what it should not do.
Not on how to spend more money .
. . but on how to spend more effectively.
Not on programs that make people dependent .
. . but on policies that help families become independent.
Not on which taxes to raise, ladies and gentlemen .
. . but on which to cut.
This tectonic shift in government is a tribute to you, the men and women who serve in Michigan's Legislature.
Women and men like Senator Joanne Emmons and Representative Bill Bullard: When I see you, I think of all the tax cuts we've made, more than any other state.
Over the past 60 months, we've cut taxes 21 times -- averaging a tax cut every three months, and saving the typical taxpayer over $300 a year.
The list is impressive: Increasing income tax deductions for interest and dividend income for senior citizens.
Increasing the maximum single business credit limit on small business income.
Revising the apportionment of the Single Business Tax (SBT) base.
A 2 percent income tax rebate in order to comply with Headlee Amendment limitations on government revenue.
Creating a limited exemption from the sales tax for commercial advertising.
Eliminating from the business tax base the cost of workers' compensation, social security and unemployment insurance.
"Phasing out and eliminating the ""intangibles tax"" -- Michigan's unfair and counterproductive capital gains tax."
Raising the personal exemption for the state income tax and indexing the exemption to rise with inflation.
Cutting the personal income tax from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent -- the lowest level since 1975.
Cutting school operating property taxes from an average 36 mills to 6 mills -- the biggest tax cut in Michigan history ($3.4 billion).
Associated with this cut is a cap that keeps assessments from rising more than the rate of inflation.
Eliminating the state inheritance tax.
Virtually eliminating the state tax on private pensions with a $60,000 exemption for a couple and $30,000 for an individual.
Reducing the state's principal business tax, the Single Business Tax, from 2.35 percent to 2.3 percent.
Raising the filing threshold for the SBT on two separate occasions -- first from $40,000 to $100,000 and then to $250,000.
Cutting the SBT alternative profits tax two times -- from 4 percent to 3 percent and then to 2 percent.
Reducing the minimum unemployment insurance tax.
Changing the definition of homesteads to provide property tax relief for Michigan farmers.
Freezing property tax assessments for one year.
And creating a non-refundable income tax credit for college tuition paid on behalf of a dependent or a taxpayer.
In 1991, our property tax burden was third worst in the nation.
With the passage of Proposal A, our property taxes are now below the national average, our average millage rate is the lowest it's been in three decades, assessments are capped and, friends, property taxes no longer dominate political conversation.
When it comes to cutting taxes, 1995 was an especially productive year: We began 1995 with Representative Susan Munsell's tax cut, we ended 1995 with Senator Walt North's tax cut, and we had seven more tax cuts in between, including our first ever Headlee rebate, sponsored by Representative Sandy Hill.
These tax cuts are not our last -- we will make even more.
And if Michigan can do it, Washington can do it!
Senator Harry Gast and Representative Don Gilmer, to you and your committees goes the credit for one of the nation's most dramatic budget turnarounds.
Sixty months ago, we faced a budget deficit of almost $2 billion.
We have balanced our budgets and turned that deficit into a $1 billion surplus.
In the process we did something no other state chose to do: We eliminated the deficit without raising taxes, while protecting education and investing more in our schools, colleges and universities.
We are going to keep our budgets balanced -- and if Michigan can do it, Washington can do it!
When I see Senators Bill Schuette and Mike Rogers, and Representatives Gary Randall and Walt DeLange, I think of Michigan's dramatically improved economic climate.
We've become a high-performance jobs engine with record-low unemployment rates.
Five years ago, Michigan's double-digit jobless rate was among the worst in the nation.
During 1994, it dropped below the national average for the first time in more than a quarter of a century.
Just three months ago, unemployment plummeted to a record low of 4.4 percent.
During 1995, we had more men and women earning a paycheck than ever before in our state's history.
With your commitment to cutting taxes, cutting spending, and making hard choices, we can do even better.
And if Michigan can do it, Washington can do it!
Representatives Jack Horton, Shirley Johnson, and Alan Cropsey, and Senators Joel Gougeon and Bob Geake: The legislation you have pioneered makes our Michigan welfare reforms the best in the nation.
No longer will our neediest children and families languish in a failed system that discourages marriage, work and personal responsibility.
Now they have the opportunity to contribute to the community, improve their lives, and gain the dignity that comes from work.
In fact, a higher percentage of welfare recipients are working in Michigan than anyplace else in the nation.
Michigan is leading the way, and we're not done yet!
Among other legislators who have made special contributions: Representatives Bill Bryant and Jessie Dalman and Senators Leon Stille and Dan DeGrow -- for your work on school code reform; Senator Loren Bennett and Representatives Mick Middaugh, Tom Alley and Ken Sikkema -- for your environmental and natural resources leadership; Senator Joel Gougeon and Representative Bev Hammerstrom -- for reforming the mental health code; Senator Mat Dunaskiss and Representative Barbara Dobb -- for telecommunications reform.
Our accomplishments are so numerous, I wish I could single out more of you.
I would be remiss if I did not mention one more group that deserves our recognition: the spouses and families who are watching at home or with us tonight -- and who are there every night -- for the men and women who serve this great state of ours.
It is with great pride that I've surveyed the historic changes that have prepared Michigan for the 21st century.
To the people of our great state let me be clear: These achievements became reality because of the men and women in this Legislature tonight.
Last year was the most productive session in a generation.
And I owe special thanks to the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Dick Posthumus and Speaker Paul Hillegonds.
Their leadership has made our success possible.
You have demonstrated the vision and boldness that have made our state number one in the nation.
Our Vision Throughout these past five years, we have been guided by a vision of the future that builds on our history.
This year Michigan celebrates the 100th anniversary of the American automobile industry.
Over the past century, that industry has helped shape not just Michigan, but America.
"In 1946, at the auto industry's 50th anniversary banquet in Detroit, one of Michigan's auto pioneers, Charles Nash, offered this observation: ""I saw the automobile business grow up and become great, and I know that its greatness has been due entirely to the kind of [people] who built it. . . ."
The pioneers who created the industry are glad to see that the [people] who have taken their places are carrying on in the same spirit.
And that spirit says that pioneering is not something that was done only yesterday, but something that will remain as long as there is .
. . a better way of doing things.
How true those words are: Pioneering is not something that was done only yesterday, but something that keeps us striving to improve day after day.
That's the spirit of Michigan.
And that's the spirit of many of the men and women in this chamber, whose courage and hard work have improved the economic climate of our state.
By removing barriers to opportunity, you have allowed the people to turbocharge our economy.
The rust belt is history.
Now, Michigan is driving America's renaissance!
General Order: Advance on all fronts Michigan has always played a pivotal role in American history.
I'm reminded of a story from the Civil War.
"At the Battle of Bull Run, when the men from Michigan arrived, Abraham Lincoln was heard to exclaim, ""Thank God for Michigan."
I also recall the famous order Lincoln issued in the first year of his presidency.
"""General War Order Number One"" he called it -- a directive to all land and naval forces to advance and to keep advancing."
He didn't give anyone the option of standing still or retreating.
My friends, that's the spirit of our Taxpayers' Agenda.
We are advancing on all fronts as well.
Where taxes are still too high, we're going to cut them.
Where red tape still gets in the way, we're going to roll it back.
Where government is still too bloated, we're going to shrink it.
Where thugs and punks are still terrorizing our streets, we're going to lock them up.
My message this evening: This administration is going to keep doing what is right for Michigan, keep doing what is working for our citizens, and keep advancing on all fronts -- reforming government, improving education, fighting crime, and fixing welfare!
GOVERNMENT FRONT No-form, No-file Income Tax.
The first front I'd like to talk about is government and the fight we are waging to make government work better for you.
Taxpayers deserve more for their money.
Citizens have a right to expect their state government to serve them -- not make them wait in line, endure permit delays, or fill out reams of forms.
Nowhere is government's burdensome paperwork more oppressive and intimidating than every April 15th, when the deadline arrives to file your taxes.
Today, across America, there is robust debate over the merits of a flat tax.
In Michigan, we've already settled that debate.
We have a flat tax -- our rate is 4.4 percent, the lowest it's been in 20 years.
Tonight I propose to push the debate even further, because almost as hard as paying your taxes is the chore of filling out your income tax returns.
Working with State Treasurer Doug Roberts, we've come up with the ultimate in paperwork reduction.
You may have heard about simplifying incoming tax forms by reducing them to the size of a post card.
Tonight, I'd like to unveil America's simplest form: it's no form.
"I am proposing the ""no-form, no-file"" income tax, and I ask the Legislature to give Michigan taxpayers the opportunity to choose this ""no-form, no-file"" option beginning the next tax year."
Last year we reduced the rate; now we will reduce the hassle.
This option would be voluntary, and all qualified taxpayers would simply indicate at the beginning of the year whether or not they wish to file a return.
Of course, taxpayers who itemize to take advantage of current exemptions, credits, and deductions may continue to file a return.
My goal is to make sure government serves you, not burdens you.
"""Clean Corporate Citizen"" Environmental Permit."
It's not just tax forms that are burdensome.
As I travel around our state, one frustration I hear again and again comes from our established job providers with clean environmental records.
These companies that have consistently met or exceeded our environmental standards wait in the same line and fill out the same paperwork as companies with no history or proven track record.
"I propose that our Department of Environmental Quality offer our most environmentally-conscious companies the opportunity to be given a ""clean corporate citizen"" designation."
This designation becomes, in effect, a hassle-free state permit that will speed the ability of companies to expand and add jobs in Michigan.
In addition, we will seek the cooperation of the Environmental Protection Agency, so that this designation would cover federal permits as well.
Of course, all environmental standards would still apply, and environmental reviews would still be conducted.
The bottom line?
The economy benefits, and the environment really benefits, because the state can target its resources to those problems that warrant greater oversight.
My goal is to make sure government serves you, not burdens you.
Roll up the Red Tape.
There are numerous other areas where we've rolled up the red tape and rolled out the red carpet.
One year ago, I called for the creation of the Office of Regulatory Reform.
This evening I am pleased to report that, in its first year, 1,000 burdensome and obsolete rules and regulations have been eliminated.
1,000 more are on the chopping block, and they will be gone by summer!
My goal is to make sure government serves you, not burdens you.
Cabinet Reorganization.
Government cannot serve you well if it is a maze of redundant departments and agencies.
Conventional wisdom says that a government agency is the nearest thing to eternal life on this earth.
In Michigan, we've already proven conventional wisdom wrong by combining or streamlining departments so that they more effectively meet the needs of our customers, the people of Michigan.
Tonight, I propose that we take the next step in improving the ability of state government to serve you.
I will shortly issue an executive order that will combine the departments of Commerce and Labor into one new Department of Consumer and Industry Services.
In addition, at a time when our citizens are concerned about the quality and cost of health-care, it is essential that we respond.
Currently, health-related programs and services are found in 14 departments throughout state government.
I will consolidate our Medicaid administration with the departments of Public Health and Mental Health into the new Department of Community Health.
This department will build on our record of getting better quality and value for the health-care dollars we spend.
Again, Michigan is doing what Washington is debating!
Michigan Works!
Just as we are streamlining state government in Lansing, we are organizing programs at the local level to make it easier for workers who need job training and re-training.
We have a state-wide network of 26 local Michigan Works!
agencies to do just that.
They are unique in the nation because local citizens are in charge, assessing the needs, training the workers, and linking workers with employers.
No other state has gone as fast and as far as Michigan in providing comprehensive services to those who seek employment -- and it's all because of strong community leadership.
For anybody who needs help, there will be no wrong door.
No wrong door for the unemployed worker.
No wrong door for the welfare recipient.
No wrong door for the student trying to break into the job market.
Once again, Michigan is doing what Washington is debating!
Court Reorganization.
Many people across the state have called for the reorganization of Michigan's court system.
I agree.
Our current system is not adequate for the 21st century.
Last year, speaking for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Brickley proposed major reforms to this Legislature.
His challenge has been accepted by Chairman Nye and Chairman Van Regenmorter of the Judiciary Committees.
My office will continue to participate as a full partner with the judicial and legislative branches so that this work can be concluded in time for court reorganization to be on the 1996 ballot.
Court reform is critically important to serving Michigan families better.
It's yet another way of making sure government serves you, not burdens you.
Renaissance Zones.
Before I leave the government front, allow me to touch on one more point.
Our Michigan Jobs Team will make some 3,000 service visits to job providers this year -- more, by far, than any other state.
In addition to our work with small business, we will call on every job provider with more than 100 employees.
Our number one job-creation strategy is to retain and expand existing Michigan businesses.
However, there are areas of our state that have not fully shared in the record growth and prosperity.
So tonight, I am renewing my call for prompt passage of our Renaissance Zone legislation.
We must expand the benefits of our growing economy so that people in every community have the opportunity to prosper.
We cannot delay.
EDUCATION FRONT More Charter Schools.
The second front on which we are advancing is education.
To keep our high-performance economy competitive and growing, we need to build on our efforts to lower taxes, cut red tape, and establish Renaissance Zones.
We need renaissance schools that prepare our young people for the jobs of the future.
That is one reason why this Legislature recently affirmed Michigan's landmark charter school law -- to encourage competition and innovation among public schools across our state.
Because of your actions, and a lot of hard work at the local level, we are making progress on the public education front.
But we desperately need to do better by the 1.6 million children in Michigan public schools.
We spend nearly $11 billion on K through 12 education.
Eleven billion dollars!
That's more than the budgets of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, and Arkansas combined!
Taxpayers, parents, and students are right to expect a better return on that investment, which averages more than $6,600 per student, per year.
It is critical that our young people be job-ready or college-ready the day they graduate from high school.
Their future depends on it -- and so does ours.
Michigan is blessed with many very good teachers and many very good schools, but not all of them measure up.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: For all we spend, we must do better!
Regrettably, there are special interests in our state that feel threatened by change.
They don't want better teachers to be better paid.
They don't want parents to have the freedom to choose their schools.
They don't want a report card on their performance.
They don't want a charter school competing with them.
They just don't want change.
They are defenders of the status quo -- which is Latin for how messed up things are!
But I've got a message for those of you who stand in the way: It's time you get out of the way!
With us this evening are several charter public school students and their teachers who certainly qualify as education pioneers.
I'd like to read you a letter that a young person in one of Michigan's 41 charter public schools recently wrote to me: Dear Governor Engler: Thank you for your help starting Excel Charter Academy in Grand Rapids.
We feel safe here because there isn't any violence like in my old school.
We learn moral values like kindness, respect, responsibility, and perseverance. . . . Learning is more fun here because I like the way we are being taught. . . . Yours truly, Hendrick Hoffman It's because of Hendrick and other charter-school students like him that we are fighting so hard to give families more freedom to choose.
I told the Detroit Economic Club last week that I'd work to establish at least 20 new charter public schools in Detroit, and many more throughout Michigan.
We're doing it for one reason: Our kids deserve better!
Financing Public Schools.
Critics of charter public schools say that competition with traditional public schools is on an uneven playing field.
They are absolutely right to say that, but absolutely wrong to claim that charter schools have the advantage.
In fact, traditional public schools have the advantage, because one of the biggest barriers to charter schools is finding the start-up money to buy or lease a building.
When a school district wishes to borrow money to build, they can ask voters to raise local property taxes to repay the debt; organizers of a charter school do not have taxing authority.
I am committed to working with the Legislature to level the playing field among all public schools, as we continue to build on the equity we have already achieved as a result of Proposal A. Apprenticeship Tax Credit.
Last week, you may have read the front-page piece in the Wall Street Journal that the problem in our state is not too few jobs -- but too few skilled workers.
The majority of our schools are designed to prepare students for college, not train students for work.
But nearly 80 percent of students will not graduate from a four-year college.
Moreover, most of the high-skilled, high-tech jobs of the future will not require a four-year college degree.
Tonight, I propose an apprenticeship tax credit to create more opportunities for young men and women to acquire the skills to fill these high-paying jobs of the future.
Make no mistake about it: We are in a fierce, worldwide economic race.
Those who prepare their youth the best will be the winners of the future.
We must succeed.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE FRONT More Troopers.
The third front on which we are advancing is criminal justice.
As a state, we can take pride in the Michigan State Police, which graduated 256 troopers in 1995.
When the current class graduates on February 2, there will be more state troopers available to investigate crimes, patrol our roads, and respond to emergencies than there have been in 15 years.
They, along with their partners in local law enforcement, constitute our first line of defense, and they've been doing a great job!
More Prisons.
For five years, we have been tough on crime, and it is paying off: Violent crime rates in our state have been coming down.
One reason is that we are cracking down on the most dangerous felons and keeping them in prison longer.
That's the good news.
The bad news is that Michigan is running out of room for all the violent criminals we will need to lock up.
I do not apologize for locking up violent criminals.
I am proud that together we have passed laws that make it easier for police and prosecutors to bring these felons to justice.
Now is no time to retreat.
If you're serious about getting tough on violent criminals, then you'd better get serious about building the prisons to lock them away.
We know that 70 to 80 percent of the most serious crimes are committed by the same 10 to 15 percent of the most dangerous repeat offenders.
It would be tragic if a repeat offender victimized one more person for lack of a prison cell.
Even your own Senate Fiscal Agency estimates that the state will run out of prison beds during 1997, so it is critical that we build four new prisons.
"And that includes the""punk prison"" I called for last year."
Tonight I urge you to act immediately.
Despite our best efforts to save children, we still have too many young people who choose to terrorize our neighborhoods.
My friends, it's time to stop pampering punks who rape, murder, and assault law-abiding citizens.
If 14-year-olds prey on others, then they must be tried as adults.
They will be finger-printed, they will be prosecuted, and they will be jailed in our punk prison.
These reforms, as well as others, are contained in my juvenile justice package, which recently passed the Senate and awaits action in the House.
I also urge you to act promptly on this.
While fighting crime is expensive, losing that fight is even more costly.
Our policy is to do everything possible to help our youth succeed.
But if they break the law, they need to know with certainty that there will be consequences.
WELFARE FRONT More Independent Families.
This far, I've discussed reforming government, education and criminal justice.
Now I'd like to move to the last front, welfare, where Michigan is succeeding and making national headlines.
Because of our highly successful Social Contract, the number of families on welfare is down to its lowest level in over two decades.
In fact, we've helped over 70,000 families free themselves from the system.
Their independence is saving taxpayers more than $100 million.
I'd like to pay tribute to Dr. Jerry Miller and all the men and women who have worked with him to implement the sweeping changes that have helped so many families.
On March 28 the new Family Independence Agency comes into existence, replacing the old Department of Social Services.
Why is that important?
Its mission is to help every needy family become or remain self-reliant.
We will measure success not by the number of families that are getting government checks, but by the number of families that are earning paychecks and don't need us anymore.
"We are so confident of success that we will launch ""Project Zero"" beginning in the four counties of Alpena, Menominee, Midland, Ottawa and in two districts of Wayne County."
"The goal of ""Project Zero"" is to accelerate the timetable to have every able-bodied adult currently on welfare go to work and become independent."
We'll help our families become more independent in other ways as well.
Next year's budget will increase our investments in child care and transportation by more than $40 million.
Michigan succeeds when we help families succeed.
National Context.
Michigan's welfare legislation passed with strong bipartisan support.
Ladies and gentlemen, 115 of you voted for sweeping changes that we are ready to implement.
Michigan is ready to go.
"Four years ago, Candidate Clinton said he wanted ""to end welfare as we know it."
Today, the only obstacle to making the rest of our welfare reforms a reality is President Clinton, who has twice vetoed welfare reform.
"In fact, the Lansing State Journal said about his latest veto -- and I quote -- ""The veto is a setback, not just for Michigan but for all America."
What the President is actually doing is vetoing families' ability to rise out of poverty.
Furthermore, he's vetoing the ability of states like Michigan to fix a broken system.
Tonight I challenge Democrats in the House and Senate to send this message to Bill Clinton: We have kept our promise to the people of Michigan; now you keep yours!
Friend of the Court.
The most important reason for welfare reform is to help children.
In Michigan, children are at the very heart of much of what we do for our state -- your children, my children, our children's children.
This is not just rhetoric.
We have a solemn obligation to make sure that, in everything government does and does not do, our children are well served.
One area where our children could be better served is in the Friend of the Court, the child custody, visitation, and support agency.
Earlier, I spoke of the benefits of consolidating government functions.
I will seek passage of legislation to gather child-support collections under one roof.
This action will comply with federal law and significantly increase the amount of child support we can wring out of deadbeat parents.
I cannot stress how important this measure is.
In too many cases, the Friend of the Court has become the enemy of the family.
For many Michigan families, the failure to receive child support is the reason they fall into poverty and have to go on welfare.
That is simply unacceptable: No parent should be able to walk away from the financial responsibility of being a mom or dad and hand taxpayers the tab.
Another area where children could be better served has been highlighted by the Lieutenant Governor's Children's Commission.
Our budget will recommend increasing the number of workers who deal with troubled families and children in harm's way.
We will also improve the training for all protective service and foster care workers so they can identify and assist children at risk.
Again, we must do better by our children.
Conclusion Leadership is about looking into the future with courage -- not just to the next session, not just to the next election, but to the next generation.
Tonight, I've looked back on how Michigan has changed over the past five years.
But, my friends, when we look ahead to the next five years, Michigan will have ventured into a new millennium.
What will the year 2001 bring?
Will it be a safe Michigan, where children can play and walk to school without fear?
Will it be a prosperous Michigan, where all who are able, work and support their families?
Will it be a highly-skilled Michigan, where our schools, students and workers are the best in the world?
I say: Yes, it will.
These far-reaching goals are within our grasp.
But achieving them means renewing our commitment to bold change.
If you think the changes of the past five years went too far, too fast -- if you want to slow down -- then Michigan will fall behind and fail to reach her full potential.
To reach our dreams, we must keep our vision.
To remain a world leader, we must set the pace.
To succeed, we must advance together.
Working together, the new millennium will begin with Michigan's rising star leading the way.
Thank you, and God bless you and keep you.
