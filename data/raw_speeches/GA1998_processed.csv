SENTENCES
"Over the holidays, Shirley and I got a great present."
A dear friend gave us two eight-week-old yellow lab puppies.
One is named Thomas B. the other is named Pierre.
And I have the papers to prove it.
One of them is a little rambunctious and has a bit of a temper.
"The other is thoughtful and reflective, even polite."
You can guess which one is which.
"I've already had to cuss `em a time or two, and Shirley, keeps telling me, ""Why don't you just try being a little nicer to them."
"These dogs will be with us for many years, and the friend who gave them to us thought it would be poetic justice for Shirley and me to get up every morning and go to bed every night, probably for the rest of our lives, taking care of Thomas B. and Pierre."
I may have to let Shirley handle Thomas B.
"Seriously and very sincerely, I want to begin my last State of the State Address by paying tribute to these two very good and very able men who have presided over the House and Senate during my time as Governor."
"Without any doubt, they are the best presiding officers in the country."
Both love this state deeply and both hold passionately to their beliefs.
"I have much respect, admiration and, yes, great affection for both of these men."
"Because of their work, Georgia is a better place and I have been a better Governor."
It has been one of the great privileges of my life to have worked with Tom Murphy and Pierre Howard all these years.
"From the bottom of my heart, I thank you both."
"This past Christmas, for the 65th straight year, a family of Millers sat around an open fireplace in the old rock house in Young Harris."
There were four generations of us.Shirley and I were the oldest.
"Our two sons, Murphy and Matt, and their two wives, Susan and Katie, were the next generation."
"Eight-year-old twins, Andrew and Bryan, teenager Justin and my granddaughter Asia and her husband Shane Martin were still another generation."
"And then their two sons -- Jacob, almost four, and Joshua, ten months, were the fourth generation."
Quite a tribe; we filled up the entire room.
"And amid the wrapping paper and ribbon,amid the oohs and aahs, the obligatory thanks and the genuine surprises, I remembered back to the Christmases past and I thought of the Christmases yet to come."
I did not need Jacob Marley's ghost or Tiny Tim to tell me how richly blessed I truly am.
"I was just a little older than my great-grandson Jacob when the President of the United States stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, looked south and said, ""I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-nourished."
That was the South I grew up in.
But it is not the South my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will grow up in.
"Today, that ""one-third of a nation,"" by itself, has an economy that is the fifth largest in the world."
"By the year 2000, the South will surpass the Northeast in population."
And Georgia is leading the way.
"Our economy has outperformed the nation's every year since 1991, some years by more than 80 percent."
"We have created more than 2,000 new jobs every week since 1991, and last year we led the nation in high-tech job growth."
"Georgia is now truly an international location, home to more than 1,500 international businesses."
"The rest of the world has discovered what we already knew: There is no better place to live, work or raise a family than the State of Georgia."
That's the Georgia those next generations will live in.
And the state of that state -- today and I think for years to come -- is excellent.
"As a student and teacher of history, I've always been comfortable with facts and details, words, dates and numbers."
"And I can think of many nights I've spent under this gold dome, working on budgets, crafting legislation, looking for the right word or phrase or idea that would forge a compromise or pass a bill."
You all know exactly what I mean.
"You are faced with it, too: large amounts of data you must wrestle with, long pages of words and numbers you must pore over, making sure that the bill does what you really intend."
"It is so easy to get bogged down in the minutia of state government, to just tune out while listening to long budget messages like the one on Tuesday, to lose sight of the forest, to lose sight even of the trees."
But one thing is certain: what we do in this building is important.
"What we do here is vital to the daily lives of real children, real families and real communities."
The words contained in any bill translate into real lives.
The numbers in any budget represent real people.
"Those numbers I spout so easily -- 299,000 HOPE Scholars, 60,000 four-year-olds in prekindergarten, 2,000 new jobs every week, two strikes and you're in for life, 57,000 families off the welfare rolls -- they are more than just statistics."
"Each number is a human being we have touched, and each touch is like a pebble tossed into the water, rippling through that person to touch their family, their community, their state."
"Behind each number is a face, a life, a promise, a future."
"So today, I want to show you something of what we have accomplished together, not just tell you."
Today I want to bring you face-to-face with those to whom we've lent a hand.
"Just as I saw it with my own family on Christmas morning, I want you, today, to see Georgia's present and look into the eyes of Georgia's future."
"As a father, grandfather and great-grandfather, I understand the deep desire that all parents have for their children to succeed, and the sacrifices that all parents make to help their children."
"For years, parents all over Georgia had been urging their children to do well in school, and scrimping and saving and doing without in hopes of being able to send their child to college or to a technical school.And then HOPE was born."
"In 1993, the State of Georgia entered into a covenant with those parents and their children."
"We said to all the children of this state: You study and you work hard in school, and HOPE will be there to help you go to college."
"You give something, you get something -- one of life's most important lessons."
And we helped Georgia families realize their hopes and dreams for the future.
"Now, almost five years later, HOPE achieves an historic milestone."
"Today, the HOPE Scholarship Program reaches the 300,000 mark."
"300,000 individual students from every corner of this state, from every kind of community, have earned free tuition at our state colleges or scholarships at our private colleges."
And today we have the honor of having one of those scholars with us.
"I am very pleased to introduce to you the 300,000th HOPE Scholar, Miss Lauren Stripling of Newnan, Georgia.Lauren, will you please stand."
"Lauren has a younger brother and an older sister, and I'll bet with three children, the HOPE Scholarship has come in handy when it comes to the family budget."
"Lauren graduated from Newnan High School with an outstanding 3.8 grade point average, while at the same time playing Varsity soccer, working on the school paper and holding down a part-time job."
"Now she attends the University of Georgia, and has earned a perfect 4.0 this past summer and fall quarters."
She told me she is thinking of majoring in history education and becoming a history teacher.
"Lauren, from this old history teacher, I hope you do it."
We need people like you in our classrooms.Thank you for coming today.Let me add one footnote.
We've touched this family before.
Lauren's older sister was a 1994 HOPE Scholar and graduated in three years at UGA.all on HOPE.
And I hear her younger brother is on track for a HOPE scholarship as well.
"Folks, these three children in the Stripling family are a living, breathing legacy that we should all be proud of."
"By your support of the HOPE scholarship, each one of you has made a difference to the Stripling family and to tens of thousands of other Georgia families."
The HOPE Scholarship Program is not the only innovation that has caught this nation's attention.
"In 1996, we embarked on another journey."
We took Georgia where no state has ever gone before.
"At that time I compared it to Columbus sailing off into the unknown on the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria."
"We became the first state in the history of this nation to offer prekindergarten, free of charge, to every four-year-old whose parents want it."
We are still the only state to do that.
"Study after study documents that the impact of pre-K lasts well into adulthood, with higher education levels, greater earning power, stronger commitment to marriage, and lower incidence of welfare and crime."
"In the long-run, pre-K students are more likely to stay in school, achieve higher test scores, and graduate better prepared for further education or the workforce."
"More than 185,000 Georgia children have already benefitted from pre-K. What an incredible investment in our children and in our future."
Now I want you to see with your own eyes where that investment is going.
I want you to look into the eyes of Georgia's future.
Would you please welcome the pre-K class of Debbie Cost and Norma Luster from The Children's Center at All Saints.
Never doubt that providing pre-K for those children is one of the single most important investments we can make.
Their head start will change the face of Georgia and the face of the South.Of that I have no doubt.
"The pre-K program reflects my philosophy of education: Not just some, but every Georgia child should enter school ready to learn."
"Not just some, but every Georgia child should have equal opportunity."
"Not just some, but every Georgia child deserves a head start."
And the pre-K program achieves that.
"Now I want to brag on my wife of 44 years as of yesterday, Shirley Miller."
For many years Shirley and I realized that the problem of illiteracy was costing Georgia both economically and educationally.
"Educationally, we were faced with the fact that nearly 30 percent of our adult population had never completed high school."
"In some counties, it was more than 50 percent."
"Economically, we discovered that over half a million adults in our workforce were functionally illiterate, costing Georgia employers over $2 billion a year."
"But, even more important, behind those cold numbers are warm bodies."
"Good, caring, decent people trapped in the darkness of illiteracy."
Shirley Carver Miller was determined to do something about it.
She wanted this as her project.
"When she began in 1991, less than 70,000 adults were enrolled annually in literacy programs."
"Today, more than 100,000 are enrolled."
"When she began in 1991, only 13,000 Georgians were earning GEDs each year."
"Today, 21,000 earn their GEDs and a $500 HOPE scholarship voucher to continue their education."
"When she began in 1991, only a few of Georgia's 159 counties had full-time adult literacy teachers."
"Today, every county has them, and more than 1,100 computers have been placed in literacy labs statewide to assist those instructors."
State funding for adult literacy has tripled to almost $12 million annually.
"Now I want to brag on two heroes: Willie Almond, Jr. from Franklin and Carrie Porter of Fort Valley.Will both of you please stand."
Willie Almond has an amazing story to tell.
He runs a lawn service and landscaping business in the city of Franklin.
"Fighting dyslexia since childhood, Mr. Almond quit school before he learned to read properly and had no plans to ever go back."
"With the help of adult literacy instructors and his wife, Sarah, he can now read whatever he wants.But he didn't stop there."
"He worked to bring a countywide literacy program to Heard County, so others could be helped, too."
And he still didn't stop there.
"Ladies and gentlemen, as of January 2nd, let me introduce you to Franklin, Georgia's first African-American city council member of this century: Councilman Willie Almond, Jr. Carrie Porter's middle name is ""Determination."
This woman doesn't understand the concept of giving up.
She had to quit school after she became pregnant.
She worked as a cook at Warner Robins Day Care Center for 17 years while raising four children.
"Then in 1993, Mrs. Porter entered an adult literacy center in Peach County and earned her GED.But she didn't stop there."
"In September of 1995, she enrolled at Georgia College in Milledgeville, and has now earned an associate degree in child development."
Remember I told you she was a cook for the Warner Robins Day Care Center for 17 years?
"Please meet the new director of the Warner Robins Day Care Center, Mrs. Carrie Porter."
Thank you both for being here today.
"The State of Georgia has done a remarkable job of helping Lauren and Carrie and Willie, and thousands like them."
But Georgia also has an obligation to protect our citizens as well.
"So, I'd like to tell you a more somber story."
We all know that DUI has been a plague on our streets and highways.
that it has caused unnecessary death and bloodshed.Too many lives have been lost.
Too many families have been shattered.Too much pain has been felt.
"DUI criminals -- and that's what they are, criminals -- can terrorize any one of us at a moment's notice.They victimize at random."
Each and every one of us is at risk the moment we get into a car or even walk down the sidewalk along the street.
"It can strike anyone, anywhere, anytime.And it can be prevented."
That is why drunk drivers have found no mercy during the Miller Administration.
But I had a more personal motivation as well.
"Back in 1992, Mr. Charles McManis was living in Jonesboro, and the first week of the session, he came to my office."
"I'd never met him before, and today is the first time we've spoken since that meeting."
"He walked into my office and handed me a framed photograph -- this portrait of his daughter, Katherine Sue."
She had just been killed by a drunk driver at the age of 21.
"Mr. McManis talked not as constituent to Governor, but as father to father.Heart to heart."
He asked me to keep this photograph in my office as a reminder of the terrible cost and terrible consequences of DUI.
"With tears in his eyes, he asked me not to forget about his daughter, and to please stop it from happening again."
"Mr. McManis has come all the way from Dandridge, Tennessee, to be with us today."
"Thank you for doing that, and would you please stand."
"Mr. McManis, I want you to know that up until the moment I removed it to bring it here with me today, I have kept your daughter's portrait on display in my office every single day since our meeting six years ago.This photo affected me."
No longer was DUI just another political fight to win.
No longer were those terrible DUI statistics just numbers.
I had this face in front of me.
"And every single day I walked into my office, she was there."
"Many people, visiting my office, have seen her picture and asked if she were my daughter or granddaughter."
And each time I've told them this story.
"Today, I'm telling our whole state."
I cannot begin to comprehend the loss of a child to drunk driving.I won't even pretend to.
"Here was a young woman, full of life and promise, gone forever because of a stupid, senseless crime."
So each and every year I asked you to take another major step forward toward making our highways safe from drunk and drugged drivers.And you responded.
"In 1997, we passed one of the toughest DUI laws in America: Mandatory jail time for drunk drivers."
No keeping your license by pleading nolo.
Confiscation of license plates.Zero tolerance for minors.
That is the kind of DUI protection the law-abiding drivers of Georgia deserve.
"Because of our work for these tougher penalties, my hope and prayer is that there will be fewer drunken killers on the road."
"Thank you, Mr. McManis for bringing your daughter's picture to my office and for being here with us today."
Now let me tell you about some individuals who could not be here today.
"Thanks to your help, we passed ""two-strikes and you're out."
The toughest crime law in the nation.
"And thanks to that law, there are 1,710 violent criminals who could not be here today, or anywhere else, because they are locked away in Georgia prisons."
"Those 1,710 criminals were convicted under our ""two-strikes"" law, and they are going to serve every year, every month, every day, every second of their sentences without parole."
And let me tell you something else.
"Collectively, those 1,710 thugs were responsible for more than 9,800 crimes, including over 4,900 violent crimes."
"But thanks to the two-strikes law, they are no longer a threat to the law-abiding people of Georgia."
And that's why you now see headlines like this one right here.
"This year, we're going to do more."
"We have not only made our human environment safer, we have also taken major steps to preserve our natural environment."
"One of our biggest success stories has been Preservation 2000, our program to protect more than 100,000 acres of natural land."
"As I am speaking, television viewers are looking at some of the gorgeous natural features that Preservation 2000 has saved."
"Places like Little Tybee Island, Tallulah Gorge and Smithgall Woods."
"You in this chamber are looking at someone shaped by that rugged land, because your Governor is very much a product of the North Georgia mountains.I am so fortunate for that."
I grew up surrounded by the spectacular beauty of the mountains.
It is a part of me wherever I go.
"We created Preservation 2000 with very ambitious goals, some said too ambitious to protect 100,000 acres of wildlife habitat and natural areas, and save it for future generations.And we succeeded."
"We preserved land in some 50 counties from Dade and Walker in the northwest, to McIntosh in the southeast."
From Rabun in the far northeast corner to Decatur in the far southwest corner.
"From the coast to the mountains, Preservation 2000 touches every part of the state."
"This land is our common gift, a wonderful gift that God gave to all of us, and now a gift we treasure and nurture and pass on to our children and to generations yet to come."
"And this year, we will do even more."
"On January 14, 1991, after I had taken the oath of office as Governor of this state, I talked about the people to whom my administration would be dedicated: The small business owners, the bold entrepreneurs, the family farmers, the senior citizens, and, as I put it then, the ""young families struggling to afford day care now and save for college later."
"I went on: ""It is to every family that works and saves and sometimes comes up a little short at the end of the month, that this administration is dedicated."
"I summed it up by saying, and I quote, ""The central purpose of the Miller administration will be to prepare Georgia for the 21st century."
Education is the most important part of that purpose.
"Without it, nothing else can save us."
"With it, nothing else can stop us."
"Today I am proud to say that with your good help, I have kept that faith."
"I have fought that fight, although I've still got some fight left in me, and I am preparing to finish the course."
"So now, as the pages turn on the final chapter of my career as a public servant, I remember how it was in that first chapter of my life, growing up in that remote valley, in that same house in which we just celebrated Christmas."
"On summer nights before the TVA dammed up the Hiawassee River and brought electricity to the valley, after the moon had come up over Double Knobs and the lightning bugs were blinking, while the frogs croaked down at the creek, and the katydids sang, and every once in a while a whippoorwill's lonesome cry could be heard, I remember after my mother had finally quit working and was getting us quiet and ready for bed.I remember we'd play a game."
"The game would start when the headlights of that rare car would penetrate the darkness, maybe once every half-hour, on the narrow strip of cracked asphalt across the ditch in front of our house."
We'd stare as the headlights would disappear and then reappear as it made its way around the steep curves and finally across Brasstown Mountain.
We'd count and we'd see how long it took from the time it went by the house until its taillights disappeared through the distant gap and it was no longer a part of that one and only world I knew.
"It was often at this time that my Mother would laugh and say, ""You know what's so great about this place?"
You can get anywhere in the world from here.
That world has turned many times since I first traveled that narrow road through that gap and out of that valley.
"It has been a long road with many twists and turns, ups and downs, bumps and wrecks."
"A road that finally carried me to the highest office of the tenth largest state in the nation, to all the continents and famous cities of the world, into the Oval Office of the White House and onto Air Force One, to Madison Square Garden, where I spoke to 20 million people through a medium unknown and unimagined when I was a child watching those cars and playing that game."
"And so I close my last State of the State Address, knowing that once again my mother has been proved right."
One could get anywhere in the world from that little mountain valley.and back again.
And I've always wanted that to be true for every child in Georgia.
Everywhere I've ever been was on my way back home.
I want to thank the people of this great state for entrusting to me for eight years your Office of Governor.I hope I have served you well.
And I want to thank my very special staff who has served me so well.
"Thanks to all of you -- my family, my friends, and my God -- it has been one heck of a ride.But we still have work to do.So let's get at it."
