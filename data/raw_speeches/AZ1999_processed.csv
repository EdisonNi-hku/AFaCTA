SENTENCES
"President Burns, Speaker Groscost, Minority Leaders Brown and McLendon, Honorable Senators and Representatives, distinguished guests, and our fellow Arizonans throughout the state, good afternoon and thank you for that warm welcome."
"Last year, I told you the number one priority in my life has always been my family.That."
"s still true, so before I go any further, I would like to introduce my husband Terry and my family who are here today."
Last year we met here under much different circumstances.
"I will always be grateful to you, and all Arizonans, who set aside politics during my transition."
It is a privilege now to stand before you as Arizona.s 20th elected governor.
We faced some difficult challenges last year.
Our public schools faced closure by the courts.
Thousands of Arizona children were without adequate health care.
Our vehicle license tax was too high.
Arizonans believed growth was out of control.
"Working together, we addressed each of those challenges."
Students First was the solution to school capital financing.
It met both the test of the courts and the needs of our students.
"By enacting KidsCare, we provided the children of the working poor access to health care."
"Our Growing Smarter Act encourages communities to begin managing their own growth from the local level up, not from the top down.The success of its companion ."
Proposition 303 . will likewise help communities by funding conservation projects they select.
"Together, we created the largest tax cuts in state history."
"We cut the vehicle license tax, we cut property taxes and we cut business taxes, saving Arizonans millions of dollars."
We proved we could face the challenges and meet them by working together responsibly.
ARIZONA ECONOMY I am pleased to report to you today the state of our economy today is exceptional.
"In 1998, the Arizona economy grew more rapidly than in 1997, which is very unusual given that our economy is in the sixth straight year of expansion."
High -paying jobs in construction and manufacturing led our accelerated growth rate.
The targeted business tax cuts we enacted last year have already borne fruit.
The Raytheon Corporation recently announced it will be adding a minimum of thirteen hundred high-paying jobs to the Tucson economy.
"The decision was based, in part, on the changes we made to our corporate income tax."
Arizona now ranks second in job growth and third in personal income growth among the fifty states.That.
s five years in a row in the top five.
Our prospects for future growth are excellent.
"The Arizona economy of 1999 is far more diversified, and fundamentally stronger than ten years ago."
"We can take satisfaction that the decisions we made, and the policies we enacted, contributed to this success."
"We now face different challenges -- laying the foundation for more stable statewide growth, and improving household incomes for all working men and women."
I am convinced we can meet those challenges if we are willing to work together again.
There has been the usual speculation regarding what direction my administration would take following the election.
Let me put the speculation to rest.
My dreams and my goals have not changed.
I want a better Arizona today and a better Arizona tomorrow.
We will get there by traveling the same road we started down 16 months ago.
Barriers to communication are gone.My doors are open.
I. m a good listener and a quick learner.
"I have surrounded myself with professional and qualified people who share my core values and beliefs -- responsibility, integrity, cooperation and efficiency."
EDUCATION Improving education is my top priority.
"We have improved, or are improving, the quality of our school buildings."
Now we must improve the quality of what happens inside those buildings.Arizona.
s new academic standards are recognized as among the best in the country.
We will not shy away from high academic expectations and standards.
Nor do we fear academic accountability.I support the AIMS test.
It will elevate all levels of learning.
I will oppose any efforts to eliminate or water down that test.
Whether or not our high school students pass the test depends on the effort and resources we're willing to provide them in grade school.
"We know that if a child cannot read or write by the third grade, he or she is more likely to fall behind at every grade level."
Many of those students will never finish school.
"We all know the sad, and expensive, consequences of dropping out of school."
We must make a commitment to work with local school districts to prepare our students at the beginning of their academic careers.
"Therefore, I propose an additional $20 million over the next two years for kindergarten through third grade for reading improvement."
I want to work with you to ensure we target these resources.I don.
t want them eaten up by the administrative bureaucracy.
I want them used to provide smaller classes and instruction for students who need additional classroom help.
We must expect excellence and accountability from our teachers.
We have begun a critical assessment of our colleges of education.
No teacher can succeed without proper preparation and a solid educational background.
We must be able to provide our teachers-to-be with more than just theories.
"And we must be cautious with each current education fad, such as cooperative learning groups."
We must work with our universities to provide teachers who can meet these new challenges.
This isn't a question of teachers not working hard enough.
"As a former teacher, I have great respect and admiration for these men and women from whom we expect so very much."
"Just as we expect them to give our children the tools to succeed in the 21st century, we must also give teachers the resources they need to get the job done."
That is why I propose we commit two million dollars over the biennium to establish the Center for K-12 Improvement at Northern Arizona University.
NAU is a proven leader in providing high quality teachers and administrators.
This center will train and re-tool teacher skills based on best practices.
That will be an excellent beginning to improve quality in the classroom.
Meeting the minimum standards of the status quo is unacceptable.
Our students must have the chance to obtain fluency in many languages.
"In a growing global economy, bilingual and multi-lingual abilities will be a tremendous advantage."
But we cannot ignore the fact that all children must learn English.
I am not advocating the elimination of bilingual education.
I am advocating that we provide students with the programs to learn English as quickly as possible.
I am a strong advocate of school choice.
During the last three years we have made great strides in this area.
"Open enrollment, charter schools and tuition tax credits give parents greater flexibility."
These options allow parents to select the educational environment that meets the needs of their children.Choice means competition.
Competition drives innovation -- that improves education.
But charter schools must be no less accountable than their traditional counterparts.
"I do not, and will not, advocate new red tape."
But I do support good sound business practices in both traditional and non-traditional schools.
We must ensure that our children learn and our limited resources aren't wasted.
We must also continue to support our community colleges and universities.Arizona.
s community college system is recognized as one of the best in the country.
Both urban and rural community colleges play a vital role in giving students the skills they need.
"Just as important, community colleges have been a major factor in helping our citizens move from welfare to work."
I will continue my strong support for this vital component of our education system.
"We can also be proud of our three state universities, which continue to gain national and international status as outstanding centers of advanced learning."
"Their valuable, and expanding, research programs have been major contributors to our economic growth."
Their outstanding graduate programs are producing tomorrow's leaders and deserve our continued support.
HEALTH/WELFARE Educating our children is a top priority.
Helping Arizona families maintain affordable and high quality health care is another.
That doesn't mean I think government should do it all.
That isn't my vision for Arizona government.
"But sometimes we can provide a hand up, not a hand out."
"I am committed to helping families in many ways, including better access to health care, increased child safety and protection, and easier transitions from welfare to work."
A disturbing trend has developed over the last years.
The flexibility extended to states by Congress has been taken away by the regulations of Washington bureaucrats.
Federal regulators recently rejected our welfare privatization program.
These are the same bureaucrats who have repeatedly thwarted our efforts to implement Proposition 203. s coverage for the working poor.
"Working closely with our Congressional delegation, we must demand an end to platitudes about restoring power to the states and require actions that truly transfer authority from Washington to Arizona.ARIZONA."
"S PATH Last year my major health initiative was ""KidsCare."
"This year I refer to my major health initiative as ""Arizona.s PATH""."
"That stands for ""Arizona's Positive Action for Tomorrow's Health."
What is unique about this plan is that it utilizes funds from the tobacco settlement.
"Under Arizona's PATH, my number one priority is to address the needs of our state mental hospital."
The situation at the state hospital is intolerable.
It is so antiquated and understaffed it has lost federal accreditation.
"We cannot allow this important facility, and the dedicated staff who work there, to be ignored any longer."
Nor can we continue to ignore the public safety aspect of this situation.
"Simply put, we need a new state mental hospital."
The new hospital should be designed to support the needs of both civil and forensic patients.
We need to provide for the increase of the sexually violent persons program.
"We also must not jeopardize the safety of patients, staff or the community."
We must provide the necessary staffing and funding for a new hospital before you adjourn.
I will appoint a task force that will provide input on this project.
Another facility that is woefully inadequate is our current state health lab.
"The entire state relies on this lab, which is no longer physically able to do the job."
Monies must be appropriated to build a new state of the art health laboratory.
The need for this new facility has existed for years.
The plans are ready; all we need is the funding to go forward.
There is also a continuing need for rural health facilities.
I recommend that grants be made available to assure adequate health facilities in our rural communities.
The health care needs of rural Arizona are as important as those in the metropolitan areas.
Arizona's PATH doubles our efforts in the Healthy Families program.
"Healthy Families, which is a voluntary program, prevents child abuse and neglect by teaching and improving a wide range of parenting skills."
I have recommended that funding be increased from $3 million to $6 million a year.
I will also propose that a sizeable portion of the tobacco settlement be used for the creation of a state health trust fund.
This would help to ensure a permanent funding stream for health care programs.
"Yet, leave a legacy to continue those programs as funds may decline."
"And to my friends at the counties, I recommend that the Legislature approve a portion of the tobacco settlement monies go to you."
This will allow you to use the money for health care programs based on the needs you have identified.
I must mention one other important program.
"Last year, funding for the Health Start program was discontinued."
"It was designed to encourage prenatal and early childhood care and served more than 7,000 mothers."
I want to work with you to make improvements to the program and make it operational again.
We haven't ignored other existing programs.
I believe it is important to take stock of what we are already doing and make necessary changes and improvements.
"During the past year, I. ve had management expert Ray Russell studying Child Protective Services."
His exhaustive work covered all aspects of the agency and its stakeholders.
"While he has discovered that much needs to be done, we also have much to be proud of."
"For example, we have one of the most highly regarded independent living programs in the country -- an alternative to foster care for older children."
"The department will implement many of his recommendations during the next year, beginning with those related to improved efficiency and inter-agency cooperation."
BUDGET I know everyone is interested in the budget.
I would like to end the suspense but I. m afraid there is no suspense.
My budget seems to have been the worst kept secret in town.
I want to assure you that the budget is conservative.
Budget growth of only 5.6% over the next two years will be less than the expected population growth.
Our revenue estimates are cautious.
And we call for growth in the state's stabilization funds.
"No, I do not believe we will have a budget shortfall."
"Yes, I will be proposing a significant increase in education spending."
"And, yes, I am proposing additional tax cuts for Arizonans for the eighth and ninth years in a row."
"As you know, this budget will be historic."
It is the first biennial budget to be enacted for all budget units under the budget reform legislation enacted in 1997.
This doesn't make the choices any easier!Just less frequent.
One of those choices has already been made -- we will be making a major investment in our public school facilities over the next two years and beyond.
The question left is: how will we pay for that investment?Do we completely pay as we go?
Or do we leverage the financing of school construction by using state revenue bonds?
"Based on our current revenue assumptions for the next biennium, I recommend a mixture of pay-as-you-go financing and state revenue bonds."
"Under this plan, over 60% of Students First funding, more than $468 million over the next two years, will be financed on a pay-as-you-go basis."
"Furthermore, I propose that ""trigger language"" be added to the budget, which may reduce, if not eliminate the need for state revenue bonds."
"If the FY 1999 or FY 2000 surplus is larger than anticipated, the amount of bonds issued the following year would be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis."
A properly constructed state revenue bond can keep interest costs low.
"And it will allow taxpayers to absorb financial responsibility for ""students first"" more smoothly."
Bonds will only be used for new school construction.
They will be as short as seven years in length.
And will carry a historically low interest rate of 4.6%.
I have included more detail regarding this proposal in my budget message.
Arizona already uses revenue bonds approved by the Legislature to pay for its university buildings and its freeways.
"Many generations of children to come will benefit from these modern and safe facilities, thanks, in part, to these bonds."
"There is another budget reality we must face: no matter how innovative or creative our programs, they will be meaningless without talented, well-trained and well-motivated employees."
Our state employees are paid 13% less than other employers with whom we compete for qualified employees.We must do better.
So I am recommending pay increases to state employees totaling one hundred twenty two point eight million dollars over the next two years.
"TAXES We are not going to have a large, unanticipated budget surplus this year."
But we will have enough to keep the tax cut promises we made to Arizona citizens last year.
I am proposing an additional 5% decrease in the Vehicle License Tax.
"This cut, when combined with last year."
"s cut, will save Arizona taxpayers more than $132 million!"
"Additionally, I will recommend that we significantly augment the research and development tax credit."
Arizona corporations will initially save $6 million annually.
That amount will grow as we encourage the creation of new products and new services.
"I recommend lowering the corporate income tax rate to 7.75 %, the second rate reduction in a row."
These tax cut proposals continue a trend to keep reducing the tax burden on our citizens and stimulating our economy.
I should also note this encourages us to keep making government more efficient.
"Prudent tax cutting empowers our citizens and limits government growth, both of which improve Arizona."
CRIME We continue to fight drugs and violent crime on our streets and neighborhoods.
Our state gang squads are working directly with local communities.
We will expand our efforts to eliminate meth labs.
This nightmare drug is not just a threat to users.
"The toxic, explosive chemicals used in its production pose a threat to every neighborhood where a lab exists.The key is prevention."
We know the cost of effective prevention is less than 20% of the cost of enforcement and incarceration.
"I have asked my Community Policy Office to evaluate all prevention programs, which they fund."
"And next month, the Drug and Gang Policy Council will implement an ""Arizona Scorecard"" to report on which drug prevention programs really make a difference."
We should not fund ineffective programs.
"I will determine what works and what does not work, and will demand accountability and measurable results for every program we fund."
We know the right approach is prevention.
And we know the best place to start is by helping the families and neighborhoods who courageously fight crime on there own every day.
I plan to move forward on a long-term program to sustain safe communities.
"This innovative pilot project will create a partnership with Arizona, the U. S. Department of Justice and local communities."
"We will redirect a portion of existing and new grant money to both suppress crime, and to root out its underlying causes."
"Unfortunately, there will be those, both juveniles and adults alike, who insist on breaking our laws, despite our best efforts."
We must also deal with slumlords and give local authorities the legal tools to stop slumlords who ignore crime and blight on their properties.
"As my budget demonstrates, like the sign at Sheriff Joe."
"s Jail, there will always be a vacancy for those who threaten our lives or destroy our property."
"And I will ensure that we continue to enforce our death penalty, so killers can.t kill again."
Last month I once again had to do the hardest part of my job.
"I attended the funeral of one of our own, Officer Juan Cruz, a 17-year veteran of the Department of Public Safety."
Officer Cruz was struck down in the line of duty by a drunk driver.
His family shares their grief with thousands of other Arizonans who have lost loved ones to the same careless and irresponsible plague -- drunk driving.
"With your help, Arizona has passed some of the toughest DUI laws in the country, including last year's ""Loper's Law""."
It calls for severe penalties for those convicted of extreme DUI.
"During the last several weeks, DUI checkpoints and task forces throughout Arizona have arrested nearly two thousand drunk drivers."
We have tough laws; we are aggressively enforcing them.
But some people are still not getting it.
Our tough new laws and aggressive public education must send a simple and blunt message -- Drive Hammered: Get Nailed.
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Another crime issue that deeply concerns me is domestic violence.
Violence in the home has tragic consequences for both the immediate victims and the rest of society.
There is a correlation between violence in the home and violence in our communities.
We have long known the horrible impact this violence has on our children.
"Directly or indirectly, we have all become the victims of domestic violence."
"Under my One Voice campaign, businesses, schools, doctors, faith organizations, governments, and individuals have come together to create a powerful team of people fighting family violence."
Volunteers provided to local shelters have helped hundreds of families escape the torments of family violence.
The impact made by these volunteers is enormous.
But they can't do it without our help.That.
s why we've increased spending aimed at curbing domestic violence by over $1.7 million in the last fiscal year.
The Governor's Domestic Violence Prevention Office is funding 15 new county coordinators to respond to victims in crisis in your local areas.
"These advocates represent my office, express my concern and carry my dual message: to victims we say Arizona cares and will help; to offenders we say Arizona will not tolerate your abuse."
"TRANSPORTATION As you know, we were recently notified that Arizona received an additional $685 million in federal transportation funds under the new federal highway bill."
I said at the time this was one of the best holiday presents Arizona could receive.
I will work through the Department of Transportation to see that these monies are utilized to their fullest potential.
"The department has already started the process of working with the various associations and communities of interest, rural and urban."
The monies will be allocated in a manner that benefits our entire state.
"With these funds, and our suggested financing mechanisms, we will be able to expedite transportation projects statewide."
"For example, in the Valley, we will be able to complete the freeway system by 2007, full seven years ahead of the current schedule."
We should be able to see these kind of results statewide when were done.
"This will enable us to improve our air quality, reduce commuting time and enhance our economic development throughout the state."
One additional transportation issue I would like to raise is the recommendation of a recent transportation town hall.
They recommended that a task force be formed to address the long-term transportation needs of all of Arizona.
I will be issuing an Executive Order in the next few days to create a Transportation Vision 21 Task Force.
"The T-21 Task Force will analyze Arizona's transportation needs with creativity, vision and reasonable goals."
GROWTH Arizona continues to experience explosive growth.
"As much as some would like to put up barriers, it just isn.t going to happen."
"People will continue moving here for the same reasons many of us have already come -- the great economic opportunities, the spectacular weather and beautiful scenery, and the honest, friendly people."
The key is to make wise decisions regarding our growth.
The success of the Growing Smarter plan at the ballot box last fall confirms what I have long believed: Arizonans care deeply about preserving their magnificent scenic heritage.
"Several weeks ago, I announced the appointment of the Growing Smarter Commission and its Citizen Advisory Group."
"I am grateful to all who are willing to serve, particularly to their very able chairman, my friend, Jack Pfister.The commission."
s work will be of immense public interest and benefit.
"And I would like to encourage all Arizonans to follow the work of the commission, attend meetings, and supply ideas."
This will help determine our state's future.
That future will be brighter if you are willing to participate.
"When the commission submits its final report, we should have a blueprint to enhance the character of our neighborhoods, sustain our rural culture, and preserve the natural areas that define the magnificence of our state."
"SPUR CROSS RANCH One of those magnificent areas is Spur Cross Ranch, which is a 2,200-acre tract in Cave Creek that has Maricopa County."
"s only year-round stream, along with a multitude of Native American archaeological sites."
It is a truly unique place as you can see.
My budget includes $2.5 million of state general fund monies as partial payment to buy this unique property.
"For the past several weeks, I have been working with Don Stapley and his fellow Maricopa County Supervisors to develop a joint proposal for the preservation of Spur Cross Ranch."
We have entered into negotiations with the majority owner of the ranch and are optimistic about our chances.
"Funding would come from our appropriation, other state funds, county funds and possibly other sources."
Please visit this property with us.
"The best way is on horseback, but a four-wheel drive works well."
Just remember to bring a spare.
I want to recognize Senator John McCain for his tireless work toward saving Spur Cross.
The inspiration of his determination has kept the effort alive.
I hope you will join the Senator and me and embrace this opportunity.
"If we can save Spur Cross, generations to come will understand at least part of the magic of Arizona."
This could be one of the greatest legacies of the 44th Legislature.
Growth continues to strain other natural resources.
Particularly our precious water supplies.
"Assuring adequate, safe water for Arizona citizens is a critical issue and a top priority."
And we too often forget the real hardships our rural areas suffer maintaining that supply.
Pressures for growth in these rural areas demand new and affordable water supplies.
"Recently, the debate over the safe yield status of our Prescott area has highlighted the need for bringing sound science and consensus building techniques to the solutions to our rural water problems."
"These challenges are regional, affecting many diverse interests."
They must be solved by local stakeholders.
But the state also plays an important role in developing the best scientific information available.
"Therefore, I propose money be appropriated to begin a statewide study of our rural watersheds."
"In addition, we must continue to protect and improve the quality of our air."
"Although we have made significant strides in reducing some pollution levels, we must continue to do more."
I pledge to fully support this effort.
MEXICO We also must protect our strong and growing friendship with our neighbors to the south.
I have already met several times with Sonora Governor Armando Lopez Nogales.
"The economic, environmental and immigration challenges we share together must also be met together."
I look forward to building on the strong bonds that already tie Arizona and Sonora together.
"For example, if we want to maintain our trade status in this region, we must develop the CANAMEX trade corridor."
This important north-south corridor linking Mexico City to western Canada strategically positions Arizona and other western states to capitalize on national and international trade opportunities.
TECHNOLOGY Fixing the Year 2000 computer problem requires leadership.
I have worked to provide this leadership to ensure rapid progress among all state agencies.
"I requested, and you appropriated, additional funding for Y2K remediation and repair activities."
"Although much work remains to be done, Arizona is in a good position to be successful in this effort."
"Moving beyond Y2K, technology can be government."
s greatest weapon in reducing costs and increasing customer satisfaction.
I am a strong proponent of increasing the ability of all state agencies and units of local government to use technology toward these ends.
"BARRY AND MO Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't take time to honor two giants of Arizona we lost last year."
Senator Barry Goldwater and Congressman Morris Udall represented the very models of what public servants should be.
Barry Goldwater started a political movement that is still vibrant today.
Morris Udall created a legislative legacy that stands unequalled.
They didn't share the same political philosophy but their personal philosophies had a great deal in common.
Arizona was always their top priority.
Their fingerprints cover the history of our state.
"Through it all, they represented us with integrity, dignity, honesty and humor."
"To these two giants, principle was more important than partisanship and real accomplishments more important than rhetoric."
"They often fought on opposite sides of issues, but when it came to Arizona, they were one."
"In an era when the ugliest kind of personal politics seem to be popular, we must follow the examples set by Senator Goldwater and Congressman Udall."
We can disagree without being destructive.
We can debate without being insulting.
"In the end, we can agree that the people of Arizona are more important than our own ambitions."
Barry and Mo have left behind a clear example of how to serve Arizona with dignity and responsibility.
"CONCLUSION Regardless of our political or philosophical differences, we will always share more common ground than battleground."
We share the same hopes and dreams for our children.
And they will share those dreams for their children.
"Again, I ask that all of us look for opportunities to bring us together, not find ways to drive us apart."
"Improving our state and the lives of the people who live here isn't conservative, moderate or liberal."
It is the job we were all elected to do.
And the job our citizens expect us to do.
"We need to listen well, work hard, and provide for the future our children, and grandchildren, deserve."
"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless Arizona."
