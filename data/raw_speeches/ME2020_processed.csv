"This year, we celebrate Maine’s 200th year as a state."
"After we separatedourselves fromMassachusetts and embarked on creating our own destiny, we, Maine people, learned to be self-reliant and, at the same time, to rely on each other."
"We carved our character and our living out of Maine’s forests, hills and tablelands, its fields, shores, and mighty rivers."
"Using two-man saws and their own strength, Maine lumbermen withstood our coldest months to fell our tallest trees."
Our state became the lumber capital of the world because of their resilience.

We stand here today because of theresilienceof Native Americans.
Living in Mainehas not always been easy.
"We have survived wars, depressions, prohibitions and booms and busts.We’ve seen hatred and bigotry."
We’ve suffered loss —as a state and as families.
"Through it all, we have been lifted up by the courage, conviction and resilience that comes from loving a place and its people."
That resilience defines our history.
That resilience will define our future.These are trying times.
"Politics from Washington and beyond are marked by rancor, divisiveness and fear."
"During this volatile presidential election year, the noise is deafening, turning us away from the security and saneness of our own small outpost."
"Tariffs and trade wars, threats of terrorism and partisanfightingparalyze the nation’s capital."
"But here in Maine, we are doing what Mainers have done for more than two centuries: putting our shoulder to the wheel and working acrossthe aisle to getthings done for Maine people.Because we are notWashington.We are Maine."
"Marked by strength, pragmatismand resilience, Maine has always been readyand willing to do our partfor our communities, for our country, for our world."
"We have alwayswelcomedpeople who werenot fortunate enough to grow up here, includingthe ancestors of those in this room who came from other places."
"We have always faced loss together, mending our broken hearts as one people and one state."
"For a moment, I want to bow myhead with you to remember three good people who left this chamber unexpectedly in the past ten months —people whose kindness and decency and dedication to this state left a mark on allof us: Representatives Dale Denno, Ann Peoples, and Archie Verow."
"Let us also remember Representative Jim Campbell of Sanford, who served in this bodyfor many years and who left us this past week."
PAUSE] God bless themand may the memories of their lives bring peace to their familiesand wisdom to us all.
This chamber is not alone in experiencing lossthis past year.
"II:Tragedy In April, a youngstate police detectivewas on a routine assignment when he stopped to help a stranded driver."
"While in that act of kindness,DetectiveBen Campbellwas struck by a tire that had spun off the axleof a passing tractor trailer, killing him and leaving his community and his state shocked and in mourning."
"Tonight,Ben’s wife, Hilary Campbellof Millinocket, is with us."
"Hilary and her young sonEverett,and the rest ofDetective Campbell’s family, are a reminderof the risks taken andsacrifices made by our courageous first responders."
"Hilary, while we can never repay Ben or your family for his service andsacrifice, wewill never forget him, and we will honor his memory."
"In DetectiveBen Campbell’s name,I ask this body toenact legislationthis sessionto increasethe state’s benefitforthe familiesof our fallen first responders."
The current benefit is shamefully inadequate to the sacrificeof those who have given their lives in the line ofduty.
We ask so much of the men and women who answer the call to service.
Let us be therefor theirfamilies in times of need.It is a simple thing to do.Theright thingto do.
"We cando it, becausewe are Maine, not Washington."
"(PAUSE)Onthe morning of September 16, 2019,a call rang out.Atruck responded.Withinsecondsdisaster struck."
"Anexplosion rocked the town and took the life of afirst responder and injured many, including one who still lies in a city hospital far from home."
"What followed was not only shock and grief, but an outpouring of support from all corners of the state to make sure the townwould be safe while the firedepartment,suddenly bereft of its finest firefighters,recovered."
"Our Fire Chief, Terry Bell, was severely injured and is still healing."
"Though we lost his brave brother Captain Michael Bell, the Chief is back, thepicture ofresilience."
"Chief Bell, I am so glad that youand Deniseare here with ustonight."
"I promise you, andIpromise the people of Farmington and the people of towns all across this state, we are going to make sure every department has what they need so thatthis tragedy is never repeated."
Andwe willmake sure that every young person in our state understands theopportunity andresponsibilitythey haveto give back to their communities—the spirit that heroes like your brother and Detective Campbellso selflessly embodiedand that you embodytoday.
"In honor of Captain Michael Bell,Iwilltocreatea scholarship fundfor young people to train in fire suppression,with the first contribution coming from my contingentaccountas Governor."
"Maine needs more firefighters, particularlyinrural Maine, and to that same end, Iam proud tosupport Senator Erin Herbig’s legislation to fund the Maine Length of Service Programtoboostretirement benefits to firefighters and EMS workersto compensate them for their service.We can do this."
"Because we are not Washington, we are Maine."
III:The EconomyI am pleased also toreport to you tonight that Maine’s economy is on solid footingand is growing.
"Revenues are up,our gross domestic product is up, housing starts, construction and auto sales are up;and the statebudgetcontinues to have a healthysurplus."
"The private sector created 5,300 new jobsthispastyear."
MyAdministration helped 800 people with disabilitiesfindand keepjobs.
Our unemployment rate decreased from 3.5 to a historically low 2.8 percent.
Wepaid off the $80 milliondebt for the Riverview Psychiatric Center andstopped the bleeding ofinterest payments to the federal government.
"My Administrationadded$30 millionto the Budget Stabilization Fund, for a total of $237million."
"And weprovided $75 million in property tax relieffor Maine seniors,families and smallbusinesses —just look in your mailbox, about 300,000 of you should receive a $104check, thanks to the bipartisan budget passed last yearand the work of SpeakerGideon."
"While this isallprogress, it is importantthat we remain cautious."
"The Revenue Forecasting Committee andthe Consensus Economic Forecasting Commissionboth expresscautious optimism about the Maine economy in the near-term,recognizing “the uncertainty surrounding national fiscal and trade policies that could impact future economic growth."
Some economists also predict a looming nationwide recession in linewith previous economic cycles.
"We must be ready for anydownturn,any changes.We must remainresilient."
That is why I am committed tosetting aside at least another$20 million for therainy dayfundthis year.
Other challenges loom large over our economy.
"As any business in this state will tell you,it is difficult to find qualified workers and it is impacting their abilityto do business.Very simply, we need people."
"My Administration has developeda ten-yeareconomic plan for the state with acornerstoneof attracting 75,000 people to our workforceand fostering innovation."
Thegoal is to make Maine aninternational leader with a vibrant and environmentally-sustainable economythatprovidesgood-paying jobs and an unmatched quality of life.
"Already we are seeingin migration–from July 2018 to July 2019, Maine gained more than 7,500 people–people who camehereto find work, people who fell in lovehere, people who came from other states, somefrom other countries –from Canada, Cambodia, theCongo and beyond."
Some at great personal sacrifice.
"Kifah Abdullahsurvived eightbrutalyears as a prisoner of war in Iran, facing death a hundred times over."
"Now, as a teacher and poet,he inspires students across ourstatewithhis story of survival and resilience."
Maine’s newest citizen also joinsus.
"The author of “Call Me American,”a young man who nearly starved to death in Mogadishu as a little boywhentheU."
"S. Marines saved himandinspired him to learnEnglishand ultimatelyto become an American,Abdi Nor Iftinfled terrorism, sought refuge in anothercountry and now lives andworks in Maine, earning his college degreehere.Abdi, you fought to gethere.You belong here.And we welcome you here."
"OurWelcome Home Programwillentice those who have grown up here and left, and those who are interested in moving here,to come to Maine."
"Just look atthe success ofTilson Technologies, led by Maine native Josh Broder."
"Tilson hires manyveteransand is leading the worldin innovative5Gtechnology,which is at the heart of our next industrial revolution."
Tilson is here tonight and represented by Adria Horn.
We want more people like Josh and Adria to start their businesses here.
"To foster innovation, my Administration will alsosupportincreased funding for the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit."
"Byhelpingnew businesses take rootand grow, we willcreate jobs and diversify our economy."
"To encourage young familiesto come here and work here, Maine alsoneeds moreaffordable housing."
"Assistant Majority LeaderRyan Fecteau has proposed a Maine Affordable Housing Tax Credit, similar to the Maine HistoricTax Creditwhich helped boost oureconomy in recent years."
"This proposal would create nearly 1,000 additional affordable homes over eight years, increasing Maine’s current rate of production by 50percent."
Send that billto my deskandI willsign it.
"Our ten-yeardevelopment plan also tellsus to enhance critical infrastructure, includingbroadband, particularly in ruralMaine."
"DesignLab, for instance, amarketing and design firm in Millinocket, usedto upload their video files on a hard drive, then they would drive to the Medway gas station where they would ask a bus driverto deliver the digital files to a video editor in Presque Isle–no wayto do business."
Internetspeeds for their business were dismal andseverely limited their productivity.
"But now,withbroadband, they are succeeding."
"As onesmall businessperson put it to methe other day,“You want togrow the economy?Give me better internet.It is time for us to listen."
"High-speed internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity."
"Increasing access tohigh speed internet will allow ourbusinesses to expandandallowallpeople to connect with schools, health care providers and markets around the countryand around theworld."
"This session, Ipropose that the Legislature fund $15 million toexpandbroadband for Maine people and businesses."
We can no longer afford to wait.
We also cannot afford to let our state’s economic advantages slipaway.
Our economy and our environment are bound together.
"Thispast session, we made smart investments inboth."
"Thanks to the collaboration of ourAdministration and this Legislature, particularlySenate President Jackson, the McCrums, afamily who for five generations hasgrownpotatoes, this year will open alarge processing plant in Washburn, Maine, using Maine-grown potatoes and creatingneededjobs in the County."
"The McCrums are the picture of readiness, of resilience.And we thank them."
"Meanwhile, twocreative financiers, Sam May and Scott Budde, createdafirst-in-the-nation credit unionfor farmers."
The Maine Harvest Federal Credit Unionwill help moreMaine farmers be successfuland give a big boost to the farm-to-table movement that has become so important toour economy.
"Thank you, ScottBudde,for joining us heretonight."
Alsoherewith us tonight is Heather Whitaker.
Sheis analternative education instructor at Gorham Middle Schoolwhere I was a student.
She started a garden at the school where childrenare learningabout growing food and about public service.
They donate more than 800 poundsof produce to the food pantry every year.
"Pleasejoinme in acknowledging Maine’s Teacher of the Year, Heather Whitaker."
But letusnot only acknowledge Heather.
Let us ensurethat the students she teacheswill have the opportunity to work our lands and fish our waters when they grow older.
"We have toconserve our parks, our working farms,working forestsand workingwaterfronts."
"Tonight, IcallonthisLegislature to send to the people of Maine a bond that providesmuchneededfunding forthe Land for Maine’sFuture program."
Maine peopleoverwhelminglysupportthis program.
"Let us give them achance to vote on a measure thatwill protect our environment,protect our fishermenand farmers,and grow the economy.IV."
Health CareWe cannothave a healthy economy without a healthy workforce.
Thatis why my first actupon taking office was to expand Medicaid to provide health care to more Maine people.
"More than57,000 Mainershaveaccessedlife-saving health care."
Weenacted LD 1 to protect health care for Maine people regardless of age or pre-existing conditions.
And we enacted prescription drug reform tolowerprescription drugcosts.
"And we are providing$62millionover two yearsfor nursing homes, understanding that that money should goto theemployees, to fulfill workforce and patient care needs."
"But there is more we must do, especially for small businesses."
"Maine’s small groupinsurancemarket has seen increasing premiums and decreasing enrollment, making it difficult for business owners to offer coverage to their employees."
"I have introducedlegislation, sponsored by Senate President Jackson and SpeakerGideon, to improve health insurance for Maine people and small businesses –all without any state tax dollars."
"LD 2007,the “Made for Maine Health Coverage Act,”offers a Maine solution forsmall businessesand it creates a marketplace designed to best meet the needs of Maine people."
"I ask this body to pass that legislationon behalf ofbusinesses like Becky’s Diner, and I want to acknowledgeone of the hardest working women I know, Becky Rand, whois with us tonight."
"This legislationiscritical to supportingsmall businesseslike hersand self-employedpeople,improving health care,and strengthening our workforce.Thank you Becky!"
"We cando this becausewe are not Washington,we areMaine."
"And because we are Maine, we love our communities."
"Welove our neighbors, but still today, too many of them are falling victim to another crisis that is harming our state–the opioid epidemic."
"V. OpioidsWhen I took office a year ago, I gave my word to Maine people suffering from substance use disorder,that help was on the way."
"I told them then, andI tell them now, they are not alone, andtogether, we will do everything in ourpower to bring them back, to make our communities, our families, and our state whole once again."
"Because we expanded Medicaid, more than 6,500 people are now receiving treatment for substance use disorder."
"-Gordon Smith, Maine’s first Director of OpioidResponse, is bringing the resources of the state to bear on this public health emergency.Thank you, Gordon."
Part of that mission is to make available the life-saving drug Narcan.
"When I was Attorney General, I used funds from pharmaceutical settlements to buy Narcan and distribute ittolaw enforcement agencies across thestate."
Attorney General Aaron Frey has continued that work.
"And, as of this month, that Narcanalonehas saved880 lives."
"Now,through thenewPreventionand Recovery Cabinetand the Attorney General’s Office we aremaking sureNarcanis morewidely available, and we aretrainingrecovery coaches and supportingrecovery centers statewide to help people turn their lives around."
These efforts complement the efforts of law enforcement tostem the flow of dangerous drugs into our state.
"Meanwhile, community leaders are alsohelping Maine people turn their lives around."
"Margo Walshof MaineWorks,who is with ustonight,is providing jobs to people in recovery."
These opportunities are critical to helping people turn their lives around.
And this effort helps us fill our workforce needs –it’s a win-winfor Maine.
"Thank you, Margo,for recognizing that Maine people in recovery are readyand able to work and that our economy needs their skills."
"Make no mistake, healing our state from the ravages of the opioid epidemic is a complicated challenge that will not be erased overnight."
"It will have manyups and downs, andwe must always tryto understand its driving causes so we can pursue solutions."
"I will call for a new panel of experts toreview overdose deaths, like the panels that reviewmaternal and child deaths, to learn as much as we can toimprove our response to this epidemic."
There is another scourge among us that we musteradicate—child abuse.VI.
"Children Come First No one can think about the past year without remembering10-year old Marissa Kennedy and 4-year old Kendall Chick, two helpless little girls who died violent deaths at the hands of their families, whose caregivers were tried and convicted last year."
The deaths of these two children represented an awful failure ofour society and our state’s safety net.
"Not to have intervened,not to have broken down thedoor and savedthose children wasa sin of the highest order."
"It is in the name of these children —Marissa Kennedy andKendall Chick —that we have reactivatedthe Children’s Cabinet, to break down the silos of the bureaucracy that failed to hear their helpless cries."
"And, with the approval of this Legislature, we have begun to rebuild ourChild and Family ServicesDivision of the Department of Health and Human Services."
My biennialbudget included funding for32 new child welfare caseworkers.All 32 have now been hired.
But that was just a down payment.
"As Maine’s Child Welfare Ombudsman recently noted, we havemore to do, but we are on the right path."
"More than 1,300 children came into state custody last year, the majority of them under the age of 5, the majority of their homes torn apart by drugs."
I will ask this Legislature to fund another 20 positionsto respond quickly andeffectivelyto reports of abuse or neglect of our children.
I know you agree:our greatest responsibilityisto protect our childrenand provide them with everyopportunity to succeed.VII.
"EducationIn our society, education is thatpathway to successand a key to addressing our workforce needsas well."
"Equalaccess to a good educationlevelsthe playing field for every student, of every age, in every zip code in Maine."
I believe inMaine public schools.
"I believe in our state’s 18,855teachers,who like my mother did for 37 years, devote their livesto making our children responsible citizens with skills to lasta life-time."
"Iam proud to say that our biennial budget:-includes $115 million in new state support for K-12 education, bringing the state’s share to nearly 51percent."
"it paved the way for a $40,000 minimum teacher salary,to ensure that teachers in Maine will not be forced to leave the state to earna living wage."
it replenished the fund to renovate schools in disrepair.
"Andit increased funding for higher education[The Maine Community College System, theUniversity of Maine System and Maine Maritime Academy]to help keep tuition affordable."
"This year, I askthis Legislature to fully fund thesecond year of the higher educationbudgetwhich wascut last spring."
These institutions of higher learning cannot withstand rising costs without the prospects of higher tuition.
And higher tuition is the last thingour studentsneed.
"The average Maine college graduate in 2018owedmore than $32,600 in student loans –the eighth-highest student loan burden in the country."
We need tosimplify debt relief programs like the Educational Opportunity Tax Credit to help more graduatesretire theirdebt.
And we must boostthe Educators for Maine Loan Forgiveness Program to incentivizeyoung teachersto workin the underserved areaswhich desperately need them.
"While lifting the burden of student debt off the shoulders of our graduates,we also must ensure secondary school studentshave the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing economy."
"We are joined by one of those18,855remarkable teachers–GregCushman,Maine’s2019 Career Technical Education Teacher of the Year."
Gregis an electrical instructor and SkillsUSA advisorfrom Lewiston Regional Technical Center.
"Thank you, Greg, for trainingMaine’s next generation of skilled tradespeople."
Our CTEs are more important than ever;yetthey have not received significantfundsfor equipment since 1998.
"I ask this bodyto fund equipment upgrades for our CTEsso thatteachers like Greg are able to provideour 8,000 CTE students with the skills thatwedesperately needthem to have."
"These are important investments that will help us address Maine’s top challenges, including our workforce shortage."
A workforce shortage is driving one of Maine’s other top challenges –ouraging transportation infrastructure.
"VIII:Transportation So, while we’re at it, in the words of my friend and fellow governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, let’s fix the damn roads!Just last week the Maine DOT released its three-year Work Plan."
Chronic underfunding and cost increases keepus from maintainingour essential infrastructure.
"With a shortfall of as much as $232 million a year, it’s time to put our heads together and get creative."
I want that Blue-Ribbon Commission to keep working on this for as long as it takes.
Isigned the Resolve that allows them to continuethat work this morning.
Partisan posturing and skinny mix won’t fix the roads.Creative ideas will.
"I’mnot opposed to using some general fund dollars to improve our infrastructure, boost our economy andreduce greenhouse gas emissions.This is not a partisan issue."
There are no Democratic roads or Republican bridges.We canfix this.
"Because we are notWashington, weare Maine."
Galen Cole knew theimportance of transportation in our state.
"Galen’s contributions to our state were immeasurable, not only as Bangor’s Mayor, but as a business owner, as founder of the Cole Land Transportation Museum, as adecorated WWII veteran andas a life-long champion for Maine’s veterans."
Members of his family join us here tonight as we remember his legacy.
"Thank you, Janet Cole Cross, for your father’s and your family’s contributionsto our state’s readiness, our state’s resilience for the over ninety years of your father’s life."
"I cannot speak to the state of the state, or discuss its future, without acknowledging another, greater, threat to our resiliency that is on ourdoorstep."
"VIIII: Climate Change As we speak this evening, wildfires are destroying far-off Australia, killing every living thing in their path."
"The Bering Sea off Alaska is ice-free, while drought is paralyzing southernAfrica."
Maine isnot immune from the damage of the climate crisis.
"Emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels —the unfortunate “footprints of human activity stomping on theatmosphere,” according to NASA,are impacting oureconomy, our health and our safety."
"It may be easy forsome to brush off the warnings of scientists on a day like today, with freezing temperatures, when a one-or two-degree hike in temperature seems harmless, even welcome.Maine isstrong.We are resilient.And we better be ready.Climate change is real."
"And it is affecting us as we speak: -Fishermen tell us invasive green crabs from southern waters are eating their clams, decimating their fisheries."
"-Ticks are now rampant,and the number of Lyme disease cases in Maine has increased tenfold in recent years."
"Some of our most beautiful towns, built alongside lakes, rivers and shores, may soon become year-round flood zones."
"Sea level rise and storm surges, in just a few years, will threaten the causeways and piers, the shops, harbors and houses of Boothbay,Belfast, Rockport, Lubec and other beautiful communities."
"And can you imagine when wemighthave to redesign Route 1, a main artery of our tourism industry, to avoid constant flooding?I told the 193 delegates to the United Nations last fall, Maine Won’t Wait.And I mean it.We are not Washington.We are Maine.We can and will do our part."
"So, this past year,we have: -Created the bipartisan Maine Climate Council and became the 22nd state to join the US Climate Alliance."
Committed to achieving 80percent renewable energy by 2030–one of the most ambitious renewable energy standards in the nation.
"Opened the door tooffshore wind projects, supportedelectric vehicles and promoted the installation of heat pumps statewide."
-Removed the cap on community solar and fixed net metering.
"Now, more than 300 new solar projects are in development."
"From a fishermen’s co-op to a capped landfill in Tremont to the Hope General Store, The Milk House in Monmouth, food pantries in Vassalboro and Saco, credit unions, apartment buildings and trailer parks, water districts, Supercuts in Brewer, farm land in Franklin County and Geiger Brothers inLewiston —solar energy is changing the landscape and saving money for people all across the state."
"At the Blaine House alone, the new array of solar panels has already savedthe equivalent ofone ton of carbon dioxide emissions."
In the coming year we will continue to:-Moveaway from oil as a primary source forheat.
"Reduce our reliance on gas for transportation,which is 54 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions."
"-Support innovative businesses like Atlantic Sea Farms, run by Briana Warner, growing kelp commercially todiversify our aquaculture economy, whilereducingocean acidification."
We will embrace energy storage and other new technology.
-We will further reduce emissions that harm our health and climate.
"Offshore WindMeanwhile, all along the Northeast United States, the offshore wind industry is generating thousands of jobs in the development of thousands of giga-wattsof renewable electricity."
"According to the International Energy Administration, offshore wind is set to become a one trillion-dollarindustryby 2040.Maine will not be left behind."
"For centuries, the Gulf of Maine has sustained Maine life."
"From the time humans first migrated to Maine, the bounty of the sea and shore have been a critical part of our sustenance."
"Food, transportation, communication, recreation all havebeen gifts of the sea."
"For Maine people, the salt is in our veins."
"But today, theGulf of Maine is in trouble."
"Warming more quickly than nearlyevery ocean in the world, the Gulf of Maine’s ability to sustain its rich and diverse resources is diminishing."
"Cod, herring, shrimp and lobster are some of the staples of coastal life already at risk.We cannot wait to act."
We are already fighting for our lobsterman and fishermen.
"Yet the Gulf of Maine is both our challenge and our opportunity.It is our new frontier.No, not for oil —but for wind."
"Thanks to this Legislature, the Public Utilities Commission and our University, Maine will build and launch the nation’s first floating offshore wind demonstration project, “Maine Aqua Ventus”, with full input from our fishing industryand our people."
"And I promise you, that commitment is just the beginning of our effort to use the Gulf of Maine and all the world’s oceans to slow the warming of our planet.We can do this."
"The University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center, led by Dr. Habib Dagher,hasalreadycreated the first grid-connected floating offshore wind turbine in the United States,and Maine “Aqua Ventus” is positioned to become a leader in this industry."
Thank you Dr. Dagherfor putting Maine on the map.
This spring I will visit Scotland to see the offshore wind platforms they are using to supply that country with clean renewable energy.
"I am determined that the business we once lost to them, we will bring back to Maine.We havegreat potential."
"Andin the coming weeks, my administration will be takingstepsforward to unleash it.Stay tuned."
X: UtilitiesMitigating the effects of climate change and moving Maine toward a clean energy future requiresthatour utilities be reliable and resilient –and that theyputMaine consumers first.
For years we have allowed electrical utilities a monopoly on our transmission and distribution lines.
"Today few are happy with the results of theregulatory framework under which these utilities operate, based primarily on setting rates that allow a reasonable profit to the utilitieswithlittle degree of benefit to the public."
"I ask your guidance and your help in making sure that these foreign corporations to whom we accede the privilege of operating in our state,are answerable to Maine, not to Spain or some other foreign country."
"Let’s work together to ensure that Maine consumers are at the table, that profits donot take precedenceover service, and that utilities are accountable and answerable to the people ofMaine."
"XI: The Past, the Present, the FutureThe stories ofKifahAbdullah, theFarmington Fire Department, Tilson Technologies, Abdi Nor Iftin, Becky Rand, Margo Walsh’s clients in recovery,Heather Whitaker, Greg Cushmanand Galen Cole, these are stories of resilience, readiness, preparedness.These are stories of Maine."
They are stories that Maine’s first GovernorWilliam King would relish.
"As I reflect upon the spirit of Maine people, in this our bicentennial year, and as I think about our history, I wonder what our predecessors would think of where we are today."
"I wonder,what did Governor William Kingsee when he traveled the state 200 years ago?-Did he see eagles flying over the Kennebec?-The same prehistoric sturgeon wenow hear leaping in the waves?-The tall elegant pines, the brightest salmon, fields newlycleared ofstone?-Middens on the islands left by Native Americans thousands of years before?-The tall rock of Seguinbeckoningfishermen and sailors home?"
Couldhe have imagined the wonders of the modern world or the new heights that Mainers have reached.
"Could he have dreamed that a young woman from Caribouwould be speeding through outer space at this moment, havingachieved history by completingthe first all-female spacewalk?Thank you, Jessica Meir, for being a hero toyoung girls and boys from Maine —proving that the sky is, in fact, no longer the limit."
"Jessica is yet another example of readiness, of Maine-bred resilience."
"What would Governor William Kingthink ofour clothing made in China or of a delivery service called “Amazon?”What wouldhe think of thegrowing “tech sector,” of the “digital age,” of cyber security or Russian hackers?What would he think of cars and cell phones, of Uber, Lyft and Air BnB?Would he have given up sending lettersfromMaine for Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or Facebook?"
"And whataboutGovernor Carl E. Milliken of Island Falls —the first governor to live in the Blaine House one hundred years ago —what would he think ofus now?One hundred years ago, on the heels of national prohibition, Governor Milliken spoke about the impending vote on women’s suffrage."
Opponents had gathered ten thousand signatures to force a referendum to block the right to vote.
"Inhis speech to this body, Governor Milliken said unequivocally, “If only one woman in Maine wants to vote, she ought to have the chance."
"This year, the Legislature cantake one more step in the direction of full citizenship, full responsibility and equality under the law: After decades of debate and forty-six years after Maine ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is time to do what 26 other states have done: Preserve equality of rights regardless of sex."
Pass the Equal Rights Amendment to the Maine Constitution.
"As Justice Ginsburg said, I would like my granddaughters, when they pick up the Maine Constitution, to see that language —that women and menare persons of equal stature —I’d like them to see that it is a basic principle of our society.So,pass the ERA."
"Now, Governor Milliken was concerned about intoxicating beverages too."
"So, he and Neil Dow would probably roll over in their graves to learn that Maine now has 153 craft breweries —more breweries per person than any other state."
And I would want to reassure GovernorMilliken unequivocally that myelection fourteen months ago had nothing to do with the fourfold increase in beer consumption in my home state.
"What will our state be like twenty years from now, fifty years, one hundred years from now?Will Artificial Intelligence replace books, normal communications?Will we have digital codes instead of names?Will facial recognition replace the handshake?"
I can’t say for certain what the future holds.
"But 50 years down the road, I predict:There will be data centers across Maine, buried ingranite, cooled by geothermal cells, providing enough spinoff heat to runa town for an entire winter."
"Skyscrapers and homes across the country will be built withcross laminated timber, invented and manufactured here in Maine.LL."
"Bean will be still be sellinggreat boots, delivered by robots —they will be goodfor spending a weekend hiking on the moon."
Visitors willstill beflockingto Westbrook to see theformation of yet anotherice diskspinning on thePresumpscot River.
There will be high speed passenger rail from Freeport to Lewiston and all the way to Montreal.
We will finally have high speed Internet all across the state and maybe even cell phone service on 295.
"And the governor of Maine, whoever she is, will be making$70,000 a year."
But know this: Everybody will want to live here.
Everybody will want to stay here.
XII: ConclusionWe have an ambitious agenda.
"There will be people who say, “We can’t do all of this now."
"Government should do less, not more."
"Building a health care system,savingpeople from the opioid epidemic, fighting child abuse and domestic violence, confronting climate change,strengthening education andimproving our workforce—Is this too much toask?"
"Former Speaker of the House Tip O’Neil once said, “Any fool can tear down a barn."
But it takes a good carpenter to build one.We can do these things.We are not Washington.We are Maine.
"Let’s build a barn that shelters our state, that protects our stock and feed, that keeps the evils of the world at bay andmakes our state resilient for centuries to come."
"One hundred fifty-years ago, Governor Joshua Chamberlain addressed this body."
"Hesaid, “Government has something more to do than to govern and levy taxes."
It is something more thana police to arrest evil andpunish wrong.
"It must also encourage good, point out improvements, open roads to prosperityand infuse life into all right enterprises."
"I think he meant, build a barn."
"Two hundred years ago, we secured our independence fromMassachusetts and became a state, though we divided the country in an unholy compromise."
"Today we set a course for the next decade, the next centennial."
"Like the pulse of our common community, the water beneath the now-crusted ice flows deeper than ever, hiding the strength and richness of our rivers, our state’s life blood."
The mountain peaks boast of snow.
"The high pines that once attracted shipbuilders and the spruce whose roots secure the granite along our shores are sure now of surviving another winter, sheltering the land formany seasons moreto come."
We are but a minute in the course of the centuries.
"But these thingswill surely be here fifty years hence —ready, resilient, strong and unchanged."
"Like them, let us preserve what we can, and build what we can, when we can, however we can of this great state in this our bicentennial year."
To all thepeople of Maine–Thank you for the great honor of being your Governor.
